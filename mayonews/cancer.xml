<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new study by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> researchers found that the presence of a specific genetic mutation — KRAS circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) — strongly indicates a higher risk of cancer spread and worse survival rates for patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</a> (PDAC). The mutation was identified using a readily available and clinically approved blood and abdominal fluid test.</p>



<p>PDAC is an aggressive form of cancer that is often difficult to diagnose. Most patients already have cancer spread to other parts of their body when initially diagnosed, and current tests often miss this hidden spread. This makes it challenging to determine the best treatment strategy. The findings, published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1245/s10434-025-17036-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgical Oncology</a>, may help identify patients who are more likely to have cancer spread to other parts of the body, therefore providing doctors and patients with the right information to make informed decisions about treatment.</p>



<p>"This is a major advancement for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/truty-mark-j-m-d-m-s/bio-20114332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Truty, M.D.</a>, hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgical oncologist within Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20475393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Surgery</a>. Dr. Truty is senior author of the study. "We've had this genetic testing available for a number of years, however, we did not know the significance of the results or how to interpret them. Having the KRAS status will allow the patient and their provider to make better decisions about their individual cancer treatment."</p>



<p>The prospective cohort study, involving nearly 800 patients — the largest patient series to date in the literature using ctDNA — found that 20%-30% of patients with PDAC have detectable mutant KRAS ctDNA in the blood and/or peritoneum, and that those without any previous treatment, such as chemotherapy, had the highest incidence. Thus, the study suggests that ctDNA assays should be performed prior to treatment to have the highest yield.</p>



<p>The researchers examined data between 2018 and 2022. Blood sample tests revealed that 104 patients (14%) had KRAS ctDNA mutation. These patients were more likely to develop advanced, spreading cancer and had a lower survival rate. Further testing of fluid from around the abdominal cavity in 419 patients showed similar results: 123 (29%) had the marker, and these patients also experienced worse outcomes. The presence of this marker, whether in blood or abdominal fluid, indicated a poorer prognosis.</p>



<p>The study highlights that while surgery is the only known cure, most patients experience cancer spread after surgery. The test helps identify patients less likely to benefit from surgery alone, guiding treatment decisions towards chemotherapy and/or radiation before surgery. For patients without the KRAS mutation (approximately 10% of cases), the test is less conclusive and other tests are needed.</p>



<p>"Historically, we've known that KRAS mutations are associated with a more biologically aggressive pancreatic cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leiting-jennifer-l-m-d/bio-20579694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Leiting, M.D.</a>, hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeon within Mayo Clinic's Department of Surgery. Dr. Leiting is first author of the study. "But this large study gives us a much clearer understanding of how to interpret the test results and use them to improve patient care. It allows for more accurate staging at diagnosis, leading to better treatment decisions."</p>



<p>The researchers suggest that this test should become a standard part of the initial diagnosis for PDAC, enabling more personalized risk stratification and effective treatment plans.</p>



<p>"This improved diagnostic capability offers hope for patients and their families facing this challenging disease," says Dr. Truty. "It's optimistic to see how advances in genetic testing are directly helping our patients."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When colorectal cancer spreads</h2>



<p>The liver is the most common organ colorectal spreads to.</p>



<p>"We are offering liver transplantation as an option to select patients. We have a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-therapy-for-colorectal-liver-metastases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatic artery infusion pump program</a>&amp;nbsp;also available for those patients where the cancer has spread from the colon or the rectum to the liver," he says.</p>



<p>The pump delivers chemotherapy directly to artery that supplies the liver. He says, in addition to surgery, treatment options include better drugs, immunotherapy and targeted therapies.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We have surgeons who specialize in advanced procedures such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/role-for-cytoreduction-surgery-in-metastatic-adrenocortical-carcinoma-new-study/mac-20535815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cytoreductive surgery</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-new-chemotherapy-approach-for-treating-stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIPEC</a>, which is a form of specialized chemotherapy given into the peritoneum for select patients," Dr. Majeed says.</p>



<p>With all these advanced options, Dr. Majeed remains cautiously optimistic.</p>



<p>"Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer where, even if it's stage 4, there is a chance of cure in select cases," he says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I just turned 45 and am dreading my first <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/">colonoscopy</a>. Why do I need to be screened if I'm not having issues? Can you walk me through the process?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you've never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">screening</a> is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we're able to identify&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-you-need-to-know-about-polyps-in-your-colon/">polyps</a>, which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we've missed that opportunity.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a number of ways we can screen for&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colorectal cancer</a>. In the U.S., we most often use a&amp;nbsp;colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with&amp;nbsp;no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-tips-to-make-colonoscopy-bowel-prep-easier/">colon preparation</a>&amp;nbsp;prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we're able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="927" height="521" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1.jpg" alt="pouring colonoscopy bowel prep mix into the bottle cap" class="wp-image-323297" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1.jpg 927w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Proper preparation for colonoscopy is key to success</figcaption></figure>



<p>It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal bloating</a>&amp;nbsp;or discomfort. That's to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736">nausea</a>. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you'll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate.</p>



<p>Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don't do any&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/anesthesia/about/pac-20384568">sedation</a>&amp;nbsp;at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your healthcare team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterwards, there's a bit of a recovery period, and then you're able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don't want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We still don't have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/11-tips-for-healthier-eating-habits/">healthy diet</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&amp;nbsp;can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/gastroenterology-and-hepatology-neoplasia-fellowship-minnesota/fellow-profiles/"><em>Derek Ebner,&amp;nbsp;M.D</em></a><em>.,&amp;nbsp;<strong>Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</strong></em></p>

<p>Colorectal cancer, the third-most common cancer in the U.S., has been rising among younger people for the past two decades. It is not one type of cancer but two cancers: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>, which starts in the large intestine, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>, which begins in the last part of the large intestine, known as the rectum.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&amp;nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="804" height="452" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Graphic of warning signs of colorectal cancer with Mayo Clnic identifier" class="wp-image-383697" style="width:856px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg 804w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Warning signs of colorectal cancer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>

<p><br>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A discovery by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers may help explain why immunotherapy hasn't been helpful for many patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In findings published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-0853/751983/Spatially-resolved-multi-region-proteomics-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Cancer Research</a>, the team identified specific proteins — fibronectin and smooth muscle actin — within colorectal cancer tissues that are associated with resistance to immunotherapy treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2025/02/26/what-is-cancer-immunotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immunotherapy</a> is a major advance in treating cancer, but many patients, including those with metastatic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>, do not respond to it. Until now, researchers have not known why.</p>



<p>"We need predictive biomarkers to guide the selection of immunotherapy for patients," says medical oncologist and gastroenterologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, the senior author of the study. "Identifying those who may have resistance to treatment can be useful, because then we can spare them from receiving treatment that may not be beneficial and could produce significant toxicities."</p>



<p>The research team used <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/spatial-biology-puts-potential-disease-targets-in-their-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital spatial profiling</a>, an advanced technology that simultaneously analyzes the expression of multiple proteins and where they are located within tissues. This approach allowed researchers to zoom in to get a bird's eye view of a tumor that includes proteins both within and surrounding the tumor cells and how they interact.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope compares the spatial tools to an aerial view of a neighborhood where one can see relationships between driveways, houses, yards and neighboring structures. Similarly, this detailed view provides physicians and researchers with critical information about the proteins in and around a patient's cancer, potentially informing the best treatment for the patient.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We wanted to learn more about the patients who did not respond to immunotherapy. We investigated the leading edge of the tumor where cancer cells are invading and where the immune system is attempting to fight the cancer," says Dr. Sinicrope. "It's like a battle going on here and we're getting a snapshot into who is in attendance."</p>



<p>The researchers focused on 10 regions at the invasive margin of a tumor. They applied digital spatial profiling to investigate 71 distinct proteins in both the tumor's epithelial compartment and the surrounding stromal compartment. Fibronectin and smooth muscle actin are two extracellular matrix proteins that were found in the epithelial region of the tumor and were associated with resistance to immunotherapy and shorter time before disease progression.</p>



<p>Upon further analysis, the researchers observed that cancer-associated fibroblasts were producing these proteins. The evidence, they say, suggests that these proteins can contribute to suppression of the anti-tumor immune response.</p>



<p>The discovery offers a step toward more personalized and effective colorectal cancer treatments. &amp;nbsp;</p>

The colon and rectum are two different parts of the lower digestive tract. These different cancers also mean different approaches to treatment that may involve the use of radiation and chemotherapy in addition to surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>When it comes to treating cancer, experience matters, says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dozois-eric-j-m-d/bio-20053346?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Eric Dozois,</a>&amp;nbsp;a Mayo Clinic colon and rectal surgeon.

<p>Colon and rectal cancers may be detected during the same&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>, but they are treated differently, says Dr. Eric Dozois.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our approach to rectal cancer, for example, often involves more aggressive treatments that help prevent it from coming back," says Dr. Dozois.</p>



<p>Innovation plays a strong role in rectal cancer surgery at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.</p>



<p>Robotic surgery allows your surgeon to work more efficiently in small spaces, providing an enhanced view of the area where the operation is taking place. Some of the benefits include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Surgery performed while the surgeon sits at a console and uses controls to guide high-tech surgical tools.</li>



<li>Allows surgeons to work in small spaces with three-dimensional visualization, and with more precision, flexibility and control than with conventional techniques.</li>



<li>Minimally invasive, fewer complications, quicker recovery, fewer urological complications and may reduce nerve dysfunction.</li>
</ul>



<p>"We're using laparoscopic and robotic platforms to really offer patients surgery that is most up to date in terms of minimally invasive techniques, the least amount of trauma to the patient, but yet achieving the goals of surgery to remove the cancer," he says.</p>



<p>If colon cancer is caught early, surgery may be the only treatment that is necessary, but Dr. Dozois says, "Even in some of the earlier stages, a more aggressive approach that combines chemotherapy, radiation and surgery is necessary to keep it not only from coming back locally, but from spreading to other parts of the body."</p>

<p>Early detection is critical for improving cancer survival rates, yet pancreatic cancer remains challenging to detect. Exciting new research offers hope as artificial intelligence (AI) models demonstrate the potential to detect pancreatic cancer earlier and with remarkable accuracy. Explore these groundbreaking advancements in a new episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodeseven&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=global&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=190206">Tomorrow's Cure</a>.</p>



<p>The latest episode features insights from&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goenka-ajit-h-m-d/bio-20152402?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ajit Goenka</a>,&amp;nbsp;radiologist and professor of radiology at Mayo Clinic's Comprehensive Cancer Center, and <a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/suresh_chari.html">Dr. Suresh&amp;nbsp;Chari</a>, professor, Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in the Division of Internal Medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>



<p>"These small cancers are very difficult to detect on imaging," says Dr. Goenka. "So the challenge with these small cancers is that they look exactly similar to what the rest of the pancreas would look like, and unless you are deeply suspicious and you're looking very carefully, you are likely to overlook that."</p>



<p>Recognizing that early detection is the best hope for improving survival rates, researchers have developed AI models capable of identifying cancers. These models have shown immense promise, identifying pancreatic cancer on CT scans at stages where surgical intervention can still promise a cure.</p>

<p>"Early detection is really our best hope, but also our biggest challenge when it comes to pancreas cancer," states Dr. Goenka.</p>



<p>Dr. Chari further elaborates on the urgency of improving detection timelines. "We are trying to diagnose pancreatic cancer earlier. The challenge we have been facing is that half of patients have stage 4 at the time of diagnosis," he explains. "We want to reduce the number of stage 4 patients. Our early detection strategy would automatically shift everybody to an earlier stage. Right now, only 7% of pancreatic cancers are confined to the pancreas at the time of diagnosis. We want to triple that number, so we came up with a number of four months. If you diagnose all pancreatic cancers four months before they were clinically diagnosed, we would significantly shift the stage to an earlier stage." These advancements mark an exciting step forward in the fight against pancreatic cancer.

<p>Meningiomas are usually noncancerous <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/meningioma-specialty-group/overview/ovc-20440783">tumors</a> that form in the membranes surrounding the brain. It may sound strange, but some of these tumors may not need treatment.<br><br>"But for the ones that grow or for the ones that cause symptoms, they do require treatment, which is either surgery and/or radiation," says Dr. Clark.</p>



<p>The goal of the surgery is to take out as much of the tumor as possible.</p>



<p>"Meningiomas have this tendency to enwrap very critical structures, like the types of nerves that control sight or control hearing, facial expression, and also encircle around critical blood vessels," she says.</p>



<p>Better tools allow for better outcomes.</p>



<p>"We have what's called navigation. So that allows us to use a pre-op MRI, sort of a GPS for the brain, to know exactly where the tumor is in relationship to the structures that we're trying to preserve and avoid," says Dr. Clark.</p>



<p>Advanced imaging tools used in the operating room help ensure surgeons remove all the tumor.</p>



<p>"Brain surgery is much safer with all of these wonderful new technologies," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research</h2>



<p>While these advancements help patients now, Dr. Clark is looking to the future.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I recently read that more and more young people are getting diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-millennials-should-know-colon-cancer-symptoms/">colorectal cancer</a>. I'm in my 30s, am I at risk? What does colorectal mean?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The term colorectal cancer combines&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884">rectal cancer</a>, two parts of the intestine. The first part of the large intestine is called the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/colon-and-rectum/img-20007597">colon</a>, and the last part refers to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/colon-and-rectum/img-20007597">rectum</a>.&amp;nbsp;These two divisions of colorectal cancer are important because they're often treated differently. Cancers of the colon, for example, may initially be treated through surgery. With cancers of the rectum, we may do treatment long before someone goes to surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms of both cancers are similar and can include&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>, overall changes in bowel characteristics such as more frequent&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>, blood from the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">rectum</a>&amp;nbsp;or in the stool and ongoing&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>, cramps or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/symptoms-causes/syc-20372709">gas</a>.&amp;nbsp;These symptoms&amp;nbsp;can be embarrassing for some people to talk about, and that is normal. However, it is extremely important if you have any of those symptoms to share it with your healthcare team. Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer increases your chance of survival.</p>



<p>People of all ages are at risk for colorectal cancer. It is true that there have been increased rates of colon and rectal cancer in younger patients, which has led to a shift in screening recommendations. We used to start screening average-risk individuals at age 50, but because of this new trend, we're now encouraging average-risk individuals to start screening at age 45. Through screening, we can prevent the development of cancer and capture&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875">polyps</a>&amp;nbsp;(precancerous growths) even before symptoms start.</p>



<p>It is unknown what has caused this increase among young people. Findings show that it may be an environmental factor. Over the last 50 years, we've seen major changes in diet.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">Ultraprocessed foods</a>&amp;nbsp;and higher quantities of red meats have potentially led to some negative changes to the bacteria that are normally in our gut, making it not as protective as it once was. A decrease in exercise and an increase in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">obesity</a>&amp;nbsp;also could be contributing factors. Living a healthylifestyle is critical —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&amp;nbsp;and a well-rounded&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/basics/healthy-diets/hlv-20049477#:~:text=Includes%20a%20variety%20of%20foods,and%20seeds%3B%20and%20healthy%20fats.">diet</a>&amp;nbsp;can help protect you.</p>



<p>We typically divide people into two groups — those who are at average risk and those who are at high risk for colorectal cancer. Average-risk individuals are people who don't have any associated symptoms that would be linked to colorectal cancer or have any of the factors that would place them at high risk.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For those who are at high risk, there tends to be at least one of three variables:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>A medical condition that places them at higher risk.</li>



<li>A genetic condition that increases their risk.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>A family history that places them at higher risk. For example, a first-degree family member such as parents or siblings who have a diagnosis of colorectal cancer or advanced polyps.</li>
</ol>



<p>Any of those three components would place you at higher risk, and therefore, you should start screening sooner and possibly more often than average-risk individuals.</p>



<p>When it comes to cancer care, we try to make our efforts personalized, particularly with rectal cancer. The treatment team consists of a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, an&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/oncology/home/orc-20198222">oncologist</a>, a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/colon-rectal-surgery/home/orc-20312712">surgeon</a>&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiation-oncology/home/orc-20188588">radiation oncologist</a>&amp;nbsp;who help direct what the next best step would be for you, whether that's&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033">chemotherapy</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/discovery-translation-labs/cancer-research/cancer-immunotherapy">immunotherapies</a>, surgery or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162">radiation</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Any delay in sharing information translates to a delay in diagnosis, which can lead to later-stage cancer. It is the later-stage cancers that can be a bit more challenging to treat. Don't delay in making an appointment.&amp;nbsp;<em>—&amp;nbsp;<strong>Derek Ebner, M.D.,&amp;nbsp;</strong></em><strong><em>Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><em></em></p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.</p>



<p>The protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.</p>



<p>"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study, detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11829009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>. "This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer."</p>



<p>T cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.</p>



<p>There are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:</p>



<p>CAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.</p>



<p>NKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic <a href="http://10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/10/2/162/678013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tudy</a> had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.</p>



<p>Dr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-383780" style="width:218px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-196x300.jpg 196w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD.jpg 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells," says Dr. Billadeau. "We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression."</p>



<p>The manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.</p>
