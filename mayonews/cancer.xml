<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers spent 2024 mining patient data, leveraging artificial intelligence and conducting clinical trials to reveal insights that improve patient care.</h3>



<p><em>By Mayo Clinic staff</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center physicians and scientists are researching the causes of cancer and its recurrence, innovating new methods to detect cancer as early as possible, and developing new and more effective treatments. Here are some of their top success stories from the past year:</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/25/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New study finds triple-negative breast cancer tumors with an increase in immune cells have lower risk of recurrence after surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>A multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044575#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20cancer%20recurrence,cells%20from%20your%20cancer%20remained." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a>&amp;nbsp;and better survival rates — even without chemotherapy treatment. The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;was published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>The immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&amp;nbsp;tumor and&amp;nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;nbsp;</a>and first author of the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/30/mayo-researchers-invented-a-new-class-of-ai-to-improve-cancer-research-and-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo researchers invented a new class of AI to improve cancer research and treatments</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers recently invented a new class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms called hypothesis-driven AI, which is a significant departure from traditional AI models that learn solely from data. In a review published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38398213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>, the researchers note that this emerging class of AI offers an innovative way to use massive datasets to help discover the complex causes of diseases such as cancer and improve treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"This fosters a new era in designing targeted and informed AI algorithms to solve scientific questions, better understand diseases, and guide individualized medicine," says senior author and co-inventor&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/li-hu-ph-d/bio-20035057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hu Li, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Systems biology and AI researcher in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. "It has the potential to uncover insights missed by conventional AI."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/06/11/melanoma-in-darker-skin-tones-race-and-sex-play-a-role-mayo-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Melanoma in darker skin tones: Race and sex play a role, Mayo study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>Melanoma is often detected later in people with darker skin complexions, and the consequences can be devastating, a Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;reveals. While&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">melanoma</a>&amp;nbsp;may be found less frequently in people with darker complexions than fair ones, this serious form of cancer can affect anyone. The study consisted of 492,597 patients with melanoma. Findings suggests that added vigilance in early screening is particularly needed for Black men, whose cancers are often found at later stages, leading to worse outcomes compared to white patients.</p>



<p>"We compared non-Hispanic Black patients to white patients and saw striking differences in how patients presented with the disease," says surgical oncologist&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study and a researcher at&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We saw more extremity melanoma and more later-stage disease."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/07/04/new-research-platform-assesses-brain-cancer-mutations-during-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research platform assesses brain cancer mutations during surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318843121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mayo Clinic researchers report on a new surgical platform used during brain cancer surgery that informs critical decision-making about tumor treatment within minutes. The platform uses mass spectrometry, a sensitive technique used to analyze substances in tissue samples, to identify a key gene mutation in&amp;nbsp;brain cancer in real time.</p>



<p>The researchers say that, in addition to enabling real-time diagnosis, the platform allows surgeons to determine a patient's prognosis and perform tumor resection to improve patient outcomes. In the future, the new platform will help surgeons tailor treatment to the molecular features of a tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/14/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo Clinic study uncovers genetic cancer risks in 550 patients</strong></a></p>



<p>Current screening protocols fail to catch a notable number of people carrying genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome, which increase the risk of developing certain cancers. This issue is particularly pronounced among underrepresented minorities.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.24.00106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, published in JCO Precision Oncology, are based on genetic screenings of more than 44,000 study participants from diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the exomes, the protein-coding regions of genes where most disease-causing mutations are found. They identified 550 people (1.24% of participants) as carriers of the hereditary mutations.&amp;nbsp;Importantly, half of these people were previously unaware of their hereditary genetic risk, and 40% did not meet existing clinical guidelines for genetic testing.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/20/new-research-discovers-a-new-combination-of-therapy-for-people-with-a-type-of-leukemia-leading-them-to-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research discovers a new combination of therapy for people with a type of leukemia, leading them to live longer</strong></a></p>



<p>In a new multicenter, international study led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, researchers found that people with the B-cell precursor subtype of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (BCP-ALL), who also lacked a genetic abnormality known as the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/multimedia/how-the-philadelphia-chromosome-forms/img-20007421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia chromosome</a>&amp;nbsp;and were in remission with no trace of cancer, showed significantly higher survival rates when blinatumomab was added to their chemotherapy treatment. The randomized study results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>



<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center hematologist. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/27/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Detecting pancreatic cancer through changes in body composition and metabolism</strong></a></p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, research findings from Mayo Clinic represent a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that could help in early detection.</p>



<p>Researchers examined medical records of patients with a common type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">pancre</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">tic cancer</a> known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms, the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in various physiological and metabolic measurements. The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in early detection.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/11/05/radiopharmaceutical-therapy-shows-favorable-results-for-people-with-tough-to-treat-meningioma-brain-tumors-mayo-clinic-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Radiopharmaceutical therapy shows favorable results for people with tough-to-treat meningioma brain tumors, Mayo Clinic study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>A radiopharmaceutical therapy that has successfully extended progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors shows early signs of delivering similar benefits to patients with difficult-to-treat&amp;nbsp;meningioma, a type of brain tumor. The nonrandomized phase 2 study's findings were presented at the&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've found a therapy with a meaningful signal for effectiveness and safety for people with refractory meningioma, a condition with no standard treatment options," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Merrell, M.D.</a>, lead researcher of the trial and a radiation oncologist at&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/breakthrough-in-treatment-approach-showing-promise-in-the-fight-against-glioblastoma-the-deadliest-and-most-aggressive-type-of-brain-cancer/"><strong>Breakthrough in treatment approach showing promise in the fight against glioblastoma, the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may improve overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed&amp;nbsp;glioblastoma&amp;nbsp;while maintaining their quality of life. The phase 2, single-arm study results are published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months, and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. "As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-treatment-could-delay-cancer-progression-in-patients-with-high-risk-smoldering-multiple-myeloma/"><strong>Research shows new treatment could delay cancer progression in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma</strong></a></p>



<p>A new treatment is showing promise for people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). This precancerous condition can progress to active&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer. High-risk SMM carries a higher likelihood of progression.</p>



<p>Results from a phase 3 clinical trial, published in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a>&amp;nbsp;and presented at the <a href="https://www.hematology.org/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Hematology meeting</a>, demonstrated that daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells, significantly reduces the risk of progression to active multiple myeloma and improves overall survival compared to active monitoring.</p>



<p>"These results are a major advancement in the treatment of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. Vincent Rajkumar, M.D.</a>, hematologist,&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;nbsp;and lead investigator of the trial. "For the first time, we have a treatment option that can significantly delay or prevent the progression to active disease, improving patients' lives and offering them a chance at a longer, healthier future."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria.

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;My brother had lingering hoarseness and a sore throat. When he finally went to the doctor, he was diagnosed with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tonsil-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20367939">tonsil cancer</a>. He's in treatment, but it's been tough. Chemo makes him sick, and radiation is doing a number on his throat and salivary glands, making it hard to eat. He's on a feeding tube, but he has lost a lot of weight and is fatigued. I'm worried about him. I never heard of tonsil cancer before this. I'd like to help spread awareness.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Dealing with a life-threatening illness — for yourself or a loved one — can be devastating.&amp;nbsp;It can help to learn more. Spreading awareness and learning about prevention are so important.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Tonsil cancer is a type of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171">head and neck cancer</a>. Head and neck cancers include cancers of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20378428">tongue</a>; the back of the tongue, which you can't see when you look in the mirror; the tonsils; or the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462">throat</a>, which includes several body parts, such as the larynx or voice box. We also see other rare cancers, including salivary gland cancers and cancers in the sinuses and nose.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Tonsils, located on the left and right sides of the back of the throat, are part of the immune system, a complex network that protects the body against infection. Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and have lymphoid tissue. That's why they can look lumpy and bumpy. They're filled with immune cells. That same lymphoid tissue is on the surface of the back of the tongue. Cancers that arise in the tonsil or back of the tongue are classified as oropharyngeal cancer, and most of these (approximately 70%) are caused by HPV.</p>



<p>Head and neck cancers, especially those caused by HPV, are more common in men. The most common way in which HPV head and neck cancers are found is from it spreading into the lymph nodes in the neck. The story we often hear is, "I was shaving, and I felt a lump in my neck." Most of the time patients don't have a lot of other symptoms. They may notice discomfort when they're swallowing or a sensation that there's something in their throat that doesn't feel right.</p>



<p>HPV is a virus that almost everybody will get exposed to in their lifetime. The primary mode of transmission is sexual. Most people get exposed in their teenage years or early 20s. The virus typically doesn't cause any symptoms, and there is no treatment. Fortunately, most people's immune system will clear the virus from the body after exposure. However, in approximately 10% of people, the virus is not cleared, and they become chronic carriers of HPV and at risk for cancer development decades later.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>HPV-associated cancers typically respond better to treatments. They tend to have a higher cure rate. We often treat HPV cancers differently than how we treat some non-HPV cancers, which are largely related to smoking and alcohol use. But we do actually see non-HPV cancers in nonsmokers as well.</p>



<p>When somebody is diagnosed with a type of head and neck cancer, we do a lot of testing to see if the cancer has spread into lymph nodes or other parts of the body. That helps us determine treatment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If the cancer has not spread, treatment is individualized based on the patient's needs, and it typically includes a combination of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. But if a patient's cancer has spread to another organ, chemotherapy and immunotherapy delivered throughout the body via the bloodstream are typical treatments.</p>



<p>In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved immunotherapy to treat advanced head and neck cancer.&amp;nbsp;What's promising for the future is the next generation of immunotherapy that aims to further engage the immune system. Research is ongoing into therapeutic vaccines that try to get the body's immune system to recognize and then fight the cancer.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Prevention, of course, is always better than treatment. While we cure most people with head and neck cancer, no cancer treatment is without long-term side effects and impact on life. While the HPV vaccine cannot prevent all cancers, it is considered a helpful measure in HPV prevention</p>



<p>The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292">HPV vaccine</a>&amp;nbsp;has been available since 2006 in the U.S. It's FDA-approved for males and females ages 9 to 45. For cancer prevention, we know from studies that earlier is better, before sexual activity begins, but we also know there's still benefit over time, even up to age 45.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to vaccinating yourself and your loved ones against the HPV virus, other tips to prevent head and neck cancers include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/basics/quitsmoking-basics/hlv-20049487">Stop smoking</a>&nbsp;or using tobacco products. Better yet, don't start.</li>



<li>Drink alcohol sparingly, if at all.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Consider healthy behaviors, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389">physical activity</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/10-great-health-foods/art-20546837">plant-based diet</a>&nbsp;with more fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Pancreatic cancer screening has advanced significantly in recent years. There are now research-based guidelines on screening for people at high risk of developing the disease, and researchers are collaborating to develop new screening approaches involving genetic testing and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>"We have high-quality studies from the U.S. and Europe that show screening can detect cancer at an earlier stage and that detection leads to better overall outcomes — most notably, improved survival," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wallace-michael-b-m-d/bio-20569473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Wallace, M.D.</a>, an interventional&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/advanced-endoscopy-center-florida/overview/ovc-20523888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endoscopist</a>&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>



<p>Here's what you need to know about pancreatic cancer screening:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who should be screened for pancreatic cancer?</h2>



<p>Guidelines recommend screening for people at high risk of pancreatic cancer — those with a family history of the disease or known genetic mutations.</p>



<p>People with a family history of pancreatic cancer have the highest risk of developing the disease. "The more relatives you have with pancreatic cancer, the greater your risk. Our threshold to recommend screening is two first-degree relatives (mother, father or siblings) or three relatives of any degree with pancreatic cancer," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>It's also possible to have genetic mutations or changes that put you at high risk of pancreatic cancer, but Dr. Wallace says few people receive the genetic testing needed to identify those mutations. "Less than one-third of people who are eligible get genetic testing," he says. "It can be a lifesaving procedure that is available and covered by health insurance."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120785/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&amp;nbsp;has also shown that a new diagnosis of diabetes accompanied by weight loss can be one of the earliest indicators of pancreatic cancer. "This is different than the more common form of diabetes that is associated with obesity and weight gain. This is diabetes associated with weight loss, particularly in people over the age of 50. Those individuals should speak with their doctor and consider having an evaluation to look at their pancreas, such as imaging or blood tests," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is pancreatic cancer screening conducted?</h2>



<p>Dr. Wallace says two screening tests are recommended for pancreatic cancer:&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>&amp;nbsp;and endoscopic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultrasound</a>.</p>



<p>"Screening should be done in a center that can conduct a high-quality MRI and a procedure called an endoscopic ultrasound," says Dr. Wallace. "That's like the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/multimedia/endoscopy/img-20007299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endoscopy</a>&amp;nbsp;we do for heartburn or stomach pain, but the endoscope has an ultrasound device on the end of it."</p>



<p>Because the pancreas sits just behind the stomach, an endoscopic ultrasound allows your doctor to get a precise view of the pancreas. If an area looks concerning, they can use the endoscope to get a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>.</p>



<p>Screening is generally recommended once a year. "In many cases, we alternate tests — an MRI one year and an endoscopic ultrasound the next year," says Dr. Wallace. He stresses the importance of getting screening from an experienced pancreatic cancer care professional. "Both tests are somewhat user dependent. That means the people performing the tests should be highly experienced in looking at the pancreas — professionals at a large academic medical center (one that educates healthcare professionals) that see lots of patients with pancreatic disease and pancreatic cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the latest research advances in pancreatic cancer screening?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetic testing and screening</h3>



<p>Efforts are underway to increase awareness and use of genetic testing, which is crucial for identifying and screening people at higher risk of pancreatic cancer.</p>



<p>People identified as high risk based on genetic testing make up only about 10% of pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Healthcare professionals often incidentally diagnose the other 90% of pancreatic cancer cases while investigating another issue, such as a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20375993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cyst</a>. "A cyst is a small fluid collection. Most cysts are benign, but there is a small subset that can turn malignant," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>Dr. Wallace and his colleagues around the world are working to establish screening tests to identify people in the 90% group. One test in development analyzes the fluid in pancreatic cysts to determine the risk of cancer. Another test analyzes pancreas juices for cancer risk.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Artificial intelligence for screening and classifying risk</h3>



<p>Dr. Wallace says about 40% of people over the age of 50 have some type of pancreatic cyst. Understanding their pancreatic cancer risk is a key part of personalizing their screening plans to identify the disease earlier.</p>



<p>Dr. Wallace and his colleagues are nearing the end of a five-year study evaluating an AI algorithm designed to help care teams classify high- and low-risk cysts.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/an-artificial-intelligence-tool-to-improve-pancreatic-cancer-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preliminary findings published in 2019</a>&amp;nbsp;showed the algorithm could read an MRI scan in half a second, compared to 20 to 30 minutes of manual review by a radiologist.&amp;nbsp;"These advances allow us to tell which of these cysts are likely to turn cancerous, and for those individuals, we can remove the cyst before it becomes malignant and prevent the disease," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>This research, which is expected to conclude in 2025, has the potential to reduce the need for invasive biopsies, enhance screening program accuracy, and improve patient outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Collaborative research and future directions</h3>



<p>In addition to the screening and early identification methods being evaluated at Mayo Clinic, researchers are focused on using indicators such as body weight, blood sugar and cholesterol to predict pancreatic cancer risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Wallace says these indicators might help suggest who could benefit from pancreatic cancer screening. "We're all getting our weight, sugars and cholesterol checked every year. Might there be a signal there that we could use to say you might consider getting screened for pancreatic cancer?"</p>



<p>The integration of genetic testing, AI and innovative screening technologies into preventive care offers the potential to identify pancreatic cancer at earlier, more treatable stages. "We're hoping to implement these advances to monitor patients and alert care professionals of pancreatic cancer risk," says Dr. Wallace. "I really want people to have a sense of hope for pancreatic cancer. We have made important improvements in overall survival and an overall shift towards early detection."</p>

<p>"If you excuse me — I can show you my deck," Arthur says, darting upstairs. Moments later, he returns with a stack of Pokémon cards 5 inches high.</p>



<p>"This is Code Breaker," he explains. "It puts two of any card on top of your deck. It's handy."</p>



<p>As he shuffles through the stack, explaining each card, it's clear that he's become something of an expert.</p>



<p>At just 5 years old, Arthur has been battling <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neuroblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20351017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neuroblastoma</a> — a cancer most common in children 5 and younger — since he was 2½ years old. His love for Pokémon has been his superpower, lifting his spirits as he battles what no child should ever have to face.</p>



<p>It started when Arthur had pneumonia, which continued to land him in the emergency department in his hometown. He began complaining about his leg when it started swelling, and his belly became firm.</p>



<p>"I called my mom and told her an internet search says it's cancer. We took him in, and, sure enough, it was cancer," says Freya Heyer, Arthur's mom.<br><br>The tumor was crushing the bottom of his right lung, so he went on breathing support and eventually extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a machine which pulls blood out of the body, reoxygenates it and puts it back in. The care team at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota</a>, also performed a tracheotomy for breathing, which is where surgeons place a small tube in a hole that they make through the front of the neck and into the windpipe. "It was terrifying," recalls Freya. "They pulled us aside at one point and asked me to decide on an acceptable quality of life for him."<br><br>After extensive treatment, Arthur went into remission for a year and was taking medication to prevent the cancer from coming back. "A few months later, we discovered that the cancer had moved to his brain and is now terminal," says Freya.</p>



<p>Freya, and Arthur's other parent, Tyler, took him back to Mayo Clinic for treatment so they could spend as much time with him as possible. For Arthur, staying at the pediatric hospital is fun, with unlimited popsicles and ice cream, magic shows, tons of movies, a rolling video game cart, and therapy dogs.</p>



<p>"I like when I get to go," says Arthur. "I get to crack stones and find gems with PT and OT. I like getting to play video games. I have loads of friends." And when he says friends, he's referring to the incredible <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a> care team — his nurses, child life specialists, therapists — and other pediatric patients. Because his initial cancer diagnosis was at such a young age, Arthur hasn't had the chance to make many friends outside of the hospital.</p>



<p>One particular friend he made during his time at Mayo was the one who helped him discover his love for Pokémon.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new friend ignites a passion</strong></h2>



<p>Kevin Pike is a security ambassador at Mayo Clinic, running weapon detection systems and verifying patient visitors. "I frequently see kids coming through for appointments or to visit patients," says Pike.</p>



<p>As a serious Pokémon player, Pike enjoys buying Pokémon card packs. Only a few cards in each pack are rare enough to keep, while the rest — known as bulk — are often set aside. But these bulk cards are perfect for kids in the hospital who are just learning the game.</p>



<p>"I started making little packs to hand out to kids so I could shrink down my bulk collection," recalls Pike. One day, as Arthur passed through, Pike offered him a deck of cards, which he gladly accepted. "I learned what he was facing and asked if I could visit him." &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Once Pike learned what Arthur was facing, he asked if he could stop in to play cards with him during his lunch breaks from time to time, as he does with other patients. Arthur and Pike became fast friends, and Arthur dove headfirst into the world of Pokémon.</p>



<p>"The gift that Arthur got with that first deck changed his life. Pokémon became something constant and something to look forward to every time we go to Rochester," says Freya.</p>



<p>And Pokémon has taught Arthur skills beyond a new game. "When he started playing Pokémon, he couldn't read," says Freya. "But now he can."</p>

<p><strong>Make-A-Wish Minnesota party</strong></p>



<p>Knowing his illness is terminal, the social work team referred Arthur's family to <a href="https://wish.org/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Make-A-Wish Minnesota</a> to bring Arthur some extra special joy. In Arthur's five years, he's lived a simple life — much of it in the hospital — so the family didn’t want an extravagant wish. To share his love for Pokémon, Arthur and his parents decided to host a Pokémon party for his friends at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Make-A-Wish provided funds for Arthur to plan the Pokémon party at the Children’s Center, as well as a pizza party for him and his family — and the chance to crack 100 Pokémon packs.</p>



<p>The community came together to support the wish and greatly surpassed Arthur and Freya's Make-A-Wish expectations:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Arthur's aunt Liz sought community donations of bulk cards or new card packs, and over 1,000 packs were collected.</li>



<li>David and Travis, Arthur's buddies at Coulee Cards in Rochester, helped make packs for the party and gave a deep discount on purchased supplies.</li>



<li>Travis connected with Pokémon Corporation and arranged to get free Pikachu plushies.</li>



<li>Rachel, their Make-A-Wish coordinator, contacted the Pokémon Squishmallows parent company, and they sent over 100 Pokémon plushies.</li>



<li>They held the pizza party at Tilda's Pizzeria in Rochester because of its robotic waiter. The staff decorated the robot to look like a Pikachu, with a face, ears and tail. It made Pikachu noises as it delivered pizza to Arthur and his guests.</li>
</ul>



<p>During the Pokémon party, Arthur was the heart and soul of the event. Beaming excitedly, he handed out cards, plushies, coins and toys to his hospital friends — the pediatric patients, his nurses and care providers, including those from the PICU. Even those who don't play Pokémon had fun collecting the cards they thought were the cutest. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Arthur's other friends — Pike, David and Travis, and his friends from the local Pokémon League in Rochester — joined the fun to support him and his wish.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Arthur's legacy will live on</strong></h2>



<p>Arthur’s family appreciates how supportive people have been and wants to share that kindness with others even after Arthur's journey is complete — and the connections they fostered through Artrhur’s journey will help ensure that the joy of Pokémon will be shared with other patients for years to come. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, Pike continues to share his bulk cards with patients, and he plays cards with those he connects with. Cards are also given to patients with simple instructions so they can easily learn to play the game. Coulee Cards hopes to start Pokémon Nights at the Ronald McDonald House in Rochester, which is extra special for the children who can't leave the facility.</p>



<p>"All this happened because Arthur wanted to share his love for Pokémon with everybody," says Freya.</p>



<p>So often with cancer, people focus on how sad and unfair it is. "I want to focus on how much fun we're having and the people we've met," reflects Freya. "Mayo Clinic Children's Center has helped us buy this time we're using to make memories."</p>



<p>If he could be any Pokémon for a whole day, Arthur says he "would definitely be a Miraidon. He looks like a motorcycle, and I like motorcycles. He's a dragon from the future."</p>



<p>It's a choice full of spirit and strength, just like Arthur.</p>

<p>Approximately 20 active-duty soldiers from the Twin Cities area were in Rochester, Minnesota, for a special mission.</p>



<p>They made a visit to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's Center</a> to meet with 5-year-old Gabe Downey. Gabe is battling <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rhabdomyosarcoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20390962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rhabdomyosarcoma</a>, a rare type of cancer often found in soft tissue.</p>



<p>Diagnosed in April, Gabe has been receiving weekly <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> treatments. His family has a strong military background, so his mother, Riley, reached out on social media to share Gabe's medical journey. This led to an incredible outpouring of support from soldiers worldwide, who sent Gabe letters, Facebook messages via his mom's account, and flags and patches from soldiers' uniforms, lifting Gabe's spirits.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/A-special-visit-for-Gabe.mp4"></video></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The soldiers presented Gabe with more patches and other Army gear.</p>



<p>The group organized a "field promotion" ceremony for Gabe, who was also presented with gifts from both the Minnesota Twins and Minnesota Vikings.</p>



<p>Judging by the smiles of his family, mission accomplished!</p>

<p>The holidays are a joyous occasion for most people. But for someone with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> or other serious illness, it can be a time of overwhelming anxiety and fear. And as family and friends get together, it's important to show that you care without coming across as insensitive.</p>



<p>Lynne Vitagliano, a clinical social worker at Mayo Clinic, offers some helpful advice to make those uncomfortable conversations less awkward.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:04) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/MCM_the-right-way-to-talk-with-someone-who-has-cancer-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Many times, people mean well but don't know the right things to say to someone with cancer.</p>



<p>"Every person is different. So it would be hard to say that there's any one right question to ask or right thing to say. What I think is most important is to convey genuine care and concern," says Vitagliano. "Offer an invitation rather than a question. So to say something along the lines of, 'I've been thinking of you. I know a lot is going on in your life. I'm here if you'd like to talk.'"</p>



<p>Vitagliano says it's also important how you respond. And the best response is simply listening.</p>



<p>"Allow them to talk about their experience without feeling the need to kind of jump in with your own advice or suggestions," she says.</p>



<p>And it's important to show that you care without coming across as insensitive.</p>



<p>"We want to say something that we think is supportive. So we say, 'I'm sure it'll all turn out OK.' Well, we don't know that, and that's not necessarily true. And so, by saying that, it almost invalidates what they've shared with us," Vitagliano says. "It's not as supportive as saying, 'Wow, you've been through so much this year. And I'm just blown away by your strength. What can I do to help?'"</p>

It is also called metastatic or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stage-4-prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377966" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage 4 prostate cancer</a>. While most advanced prostate cancer is incurable, treatments can slow or shrink the cancer, reduce symptoms and extend a person's life.</p>



<p>Recent advancements in diagnostic techniques and new treatments have improved the survival rate for advanced prostate cancer. "A variety of treatments, including hormonal treatments, can control the disease for a longer period, even if it's metastatic," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sartor-alton-o-m-d/bio-20548417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oliver Sartor, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic oncologist specializing in prostate cancer.</p>



<p>Here's what Dr. Sartor wants you to know about advanced prostate cancer and its treatment:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prostate cancer treatment is highly personalized.</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prostate cancer treatment</a>&amp;nbsp;is individualized to each person and their cancer, says Dr. Sartor. "The thing that makes prostate cancer different from other cancers is the huge diversity in the disease. The treatment your neighbor had likely won't be the same treatment you'll have. Assessments and treatment are very personalized," he says.</p>



<p>If your biopsy confirms the presence of prostate cancer, a doctor will examine your cancer cells in a lab to determine how much they differ from healthy cells. A higher grade indicates a more aggressive cancer that is likely to spread quickly.</p>



<p>Genetic testing results could make you a candidate for targeted drug therapies, which attack specific chemicals in cancer cells, or immunotherapies, which help the body's immune system kill cancer cells, says Dr. Sartor. "We genetically test the DNA you're born with and the DNA from your tumor," he says.</p>



<p>Treatment planning also considers the parts of your body to which cancer has spread. "Maybe it's metastatic to the bones or the lymph nodes only. Maybe you've already had surgery, and you thought it was cured, and it came back. Each of these circumstances warrants individual assessment and treatment recommendations," says Dr. Sartor.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A PSA test may reduce advanced prostate cancer risk.</h2>



<p>Detecting prostate cancer early, when treatment is most effective, may help you avoid advanced prostate cancer. One way to do that is through a PSA test.</p>



<p>A&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/psa-test/about/pac-20384731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSA test</a>&amp;nbsp;is a blood test that measures the amount of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in your blood. PSA is a protein produced by both cancerous and noncancerous tissue in the prostate. A PSA test can detect high levels of PSA that may indicate the presence of prostate cancer. Ordinarily, small amounts of PSA circulate in the blood.</p>



<p>Other conditions, including an enlarged or inflamed prostate, also can increase PSA levels. This means that determining what a high PSA score means can be complicated. "It's a screening test that has some degree of controversy attached to it," says Dr. Sartor. "A PSA test may detect cancers that don't need to be treated. But it diminishes the risk of being diagnosed with advanced disease by detecting cancer early. I get a PSA myself."</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>"A PSA test may detect cancers that don't need to be treated. But it diminishes the risk of being diagnosed with advanced disease by detecting cancer early. I get a PSA myself."Dr. Oliver Sartor</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you are diagnosed with low-grade prostate cancer that is expected to grow slowly, your cancer isn't causing symptoms, and it is confined to a small area of your prostate, you may not need immediate treatment. "Surveillance may be a good option for you," says Dr. Sartor. Active surveillance involves regular follow-up blood tests, imaging and, potentially, prostate biopsies to monitor the progression of your cancer.</p>



<p>"Age 50 is a reasonable age to start getting a PSA. But if you are African American or have a significant family history of prostate cancer or a genetic alteration that might predispose you to prostate cancer, then you should get one sooner," says Dr. Sartor.</p>



<p>Talk to your healthcare professional about when you should start PSA testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Radiopharmaceuticals offer new hope.</h2>



<p>Prostate cancer cells rely on testosterone to help them grow. Hormone therapy, a treatment to stop your body from producing testosterone, is often used to shrink advanced prostate cancer and slow its growth. Therapy options include medications and surgery to remove the testicles. Prostate cancer that has stopped responding to hormone therapy is called castrate-resistant prostate cancer.</p>



<p>Some people with advanced castrate-resistant prostate cancer now have a new option: PSMA lutetium-177, also known as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/lutetium-lu-177-vipivotide-tetraxetan-intravenous-route/description/drg-20531832" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lutetium Lu 177 vipivotide tetraxetan</a>, a radiopharmaceutical.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2020/radiopharmaceuticals-cancer-radiation-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radiopharmaceuticals</a>&amp;nbsp;are drugs containing a radioactive substance used to diagnose or treat disease.</p>



<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PSMA lutetium-177 for adults whose prostate cancer:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Produces a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA).</li>



<li>Has been treated with a hormone therapy called androgen receptor pathway inhibition.</li>



<li>Has been treated with drugs that stop cancer cells from dividing and growing, called taxane-based chemotherapy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Healthcare professionals use an imaging test called a PSMA&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pet-scan/about/pac-20385078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PET scan</a>&amp;nbsp;to determine if people are eligible for PSMA lutetium-177 treatment. Before undergoing this type of scan, you receive an IV injection of another radiopharmaceutical — a radioactive tracer that binds to the PSMA protein on prostate cancer cells. This tracer can be detected on the scan.</p>



<p>Dr. Sartor says determining eligibility for PSMA lutetium-177 involves carefully reviewing multiple factors, including previous treatments and the extent of the cancer's spread. "The patients who respond best have a lot of PSMA PET uptake and do not have liver involvement," he says. This means that if your PSMA PET scans show a significant amount of tracer in your cancer cells and your cancer has not spread to your liver, you're more likely to have a good response to the treatment.</p>



<p>Dr. Sartor stresses that this radiopharmaceutical may only prove effective for some people. "About a third of patients respond beautifully. About a third of patients don't respond at all, and the rest are in the middle," he says.</p>



<p>Research on PSMA lutetium-177 is advancing quickly and it may soon be an option for people with advanced prostate cancer before chemotherapy, says Dr. Sartor, who conducts clinical trials on radiopharmaceuticals. "I believe this therapy can safely benefit a significant number of patients who are not receiving it today," he says.</p>

<p>Richard Casper was one of the study participants. The Arizona man enrolled in the clinical trial at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix after his diagnosis of glioblastoma in 2019. Richard was given only months to live, but his family says thanks to his strength, perseverance, and innovative medical care, he survived nearly double the amount of time.</p>



<p>"To be almost two and a half, three years in after being told you only have a few months, it's quite remarkable," says Susan Casper, Richard's daughter.</p>



<p>Richard succumbed to the disease in 2023. During the treatment, his family says he had little to no side effects. In the months before his passing, Richard stated, "I feel great. If someone didn't tell me I have the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-learn-about-meningioma-and-glioblastoma-brain-tumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a>, I wouldn't even know it."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is glioblastoma so deadly?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/glioblastoma-in-older-adults-improving-survival-and-quality-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glioblastoma</a> is among the most challenging cancers to treat. The disease is aggressive and invades healthy brain tissue with hairlike tentacles. "That is why doing a complete surgery is very difficult, as compared to say <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, where a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> can be performed to remove not only the tumor, but a healthy rim of tissue around it," explains Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Surgery for glioblastoma presents a different set of obstacles. "When it comes to glioblastoma, it is challenging to do that level of surgery. You try to surgically remove whatever you can safely without leaving the patient worse off after surgery."</p>



<p>Another factor that makes glioblastoma so lethal is that it can be fast- growing and unresponsive to treatment. </p>



<p>"These cancer cells are quite challenging to overcome," says Dr. Vora. "There are some patients we see after their surgery, and by the time we are ready to start their treatment, they've already had a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/connect-with-other-patients-who-have-fear-of-cancer-recurrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a> of the disease."</p>

<p>An estimated 14,500 people will be diagnosed with glioblastoma in the U.S this year. "In the best of circumstances the average survival rates are in the 14-15 month range. But for patients 65 and older, the group that was the focus of our study, patients do even worse. The prognosis for this population is between six and nine months," says Dr. Vora.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Attacking glioblastoma with a triad </strong></h2>



<p>For the clinical trial, Dr. Vora and his team mapped out a plan that would allow them to be more intentional and precise with treating the location of the glioblastoma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397931" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-300x163.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-768x417.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1536x834.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-2048x1112.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"It is the triad of metabolic imaging, proton beam therapy and hypofractionation, which is a shorter course of radiation that might be the best combination to treat glioblastoma in the 65-and-older patient population."</p><cite>Dr. Sujay Vora, radiation oncologist &amp;amp; Principal study investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The imaging incorporated the use of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. "<sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET is an amino acid tracer that can cross the blood brain barrier, and it can accumulate within the glioblastoma cells itself," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Researchers combined these images to determine the location of the most metabolically active "hot spots" of the cancer in the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking aim with proton beam therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Study investigators used one of the most advanced forms of radiation treatment, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>. </p>



<p>"With standard <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/living-with-cancer-what-is-radiation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a>, the beams go through the brain tissue, so there's an entrance dose and the exit dose. But with proton beam therapy, we dial up how deeply we want the radiation to go," explains Dr. Vora. "It drops off its energy in the tumor, and then there's basically no radiation after that. It allows us to be more preferential into the delivery of radiation and protect more of the healthy surrounding tissue."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="897" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-1024x897.png" alt="" class="wp-image-397936" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-1024x897.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-300x263.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-768x673.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-1536x1345.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture.png 1546w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>During proton beam therapy, a patient lies on a table while the machine rotates around the patient's head targeting the tumor with an invisible beam. The patient is awake for the procedure. It is painless with many patients reporting fewer to no side effects.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional radiation for glioblastoma, which is typically delivered over the course of three to six weeks, treatment with proton beam therapy for the study was conducted in one to two weeks.</p>

<p>"I am hopeful that this is the first step of many where we can continue to move the needle and allow patients to live longer and live well," says Dr. Vora. "The goal is to improve the outcomes for our patients allowing them to spend more time with their families."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nadya's story</strong></h2>



<p>2022 was a tough year for Nadya El-Afandi. She was on the verge of celebrating a long but successful battle with breast cancer.</p>



<p>"Out of the blue, I had a seizure. I went to the hospital, they did an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-questions-about-mri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>.  After additional tests they told me the news: 'You have a glioblastoma,'" recalls Nadya. She asked her doctor if she should continue her breast cancer treatment. "He said, 'No'-meaning the glioblastoma would kill me before the breast cancer."</p>



<p>Nadya was not about to give up.</p>

<p>Nadya is a wife and mother of four children. She lives just outside of Rochester, Minnesota. "My children said to me, 'Mom, you're a unicorn. Of course you'll live.' My mother has had a number of medical conditions and we never expected her to live this long. And she's still alive and with us," says Nadya. "My children have also said, 'You've got grandma's blood in you. You will live.'"</p>



<p>Nadya is receiving care at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>. That's where she learned about a new clinical trial called SAGA, or stereotactic ablative radiation treatment for glioblastoma. The phase 2 clinical trial is building upon Dr. Vora's research and studying a larger group of patients. The study is being led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Dr. William</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Breen</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Our goal is to transform the way we treat glioblastoma - in that we are using advanced imaging to help us better target the tumor. We're looking at shorter courses of radiation to minimize the burden on patients and their families and hopefully complete effective and safe treatment in a shorter amount of time.</p><cite>William Breen, M.D., Radiation Oncologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It has been 15 months since Nadya began treatment for glioblastoma. So far, there is no sign the glioblastoma has returned. "Nadya has already exceeded the time that's expected time to have a tumor recurrence, and she continues to do well," says Dr. Breen. "Nadya is beyond some measures of what the average, overall survival time would be."</p>



<p>While Nadya's progress in encouraging, Dr. Breen says it is important to note that it is too early to draw any conclusions about safety or efficacy of this approach to treatment until the study is completed.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nadya is focused on living her life to the fullest. Fifteen months after undergoing treatment, Nadya embarked on an adventure to Hawaii, where she spent time taking helicopter tours, snorkeling and hiking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We are living on the edge of medical miracles, and we are riding that tide. There's no cure for glioblastoma yet. But I've been able to take advantage of this medical opportunity, and it has given me a quality of life that is just outstanding. Every day is the best day and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it."</p><cite>Nadya El-Afandi, glioblastoma patient</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may offer improvement in overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20569077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> while maintaining quality of life. Glioblastoma is the most lethal type of primary brain cancer due to its aggressive nature and its treatment-resistant characteristics. It is the most common form of primary brain cancer. Each year an estimated 14,500 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease. Results of Mayo Clinic's phase 2, single-arm study are published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months and the median overall survival was 13.1 months." As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora. "In some cases, patients with tumors that have favorable genetics lived even longer, with a median survival of 22 months. We are very excited about these results."</p>



<p>Glioblastoma is among the most challenging cancers to treat. The disease invades healthy brain tissue with hairlike tentacles, making surgical removal intricate. Surgeons must carefully balance removing as much of the tumor as possible while avoiding harm to critical areas of the brain responsible for essential functions such as movement and speech. Additionally, the tumor's cellular composition and its ability to evade therapies further challenge treatment efforts.</p>



<p>Standard radiation therapy is commonly used to treat glioblastoma and can be effective. However, a limitation is that it also exposes healthy brain tissue to radiation, potentially causing collateral, unintended damage. For the Mayo Clinic study, investigators used one of the most innovative and advanced forms of radiation treatment, called proton beam therapy. The cutting-edge, nonsurgical form of radiation therapy destroys cancer cells with targeted precision while minimizing side effects to surrounding healthy tissue.</p>



<p>Mayo investigators mapped the target area in the patient's brain by combining the advanced imaging technologies, including <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. "Combining advanced imaging allowed us to determine the most metabolically active, or aggressive, regions of the glioblastoma," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>Treatment was completed in one to two weeks instead of the traditional three to six weeks. "The advanced imaging along with the proton beam therapy allowed us to be more focused with radiation and protect surrounding healthy brain tissue from the effects of radiation. We were able to see that patients tolerated the treatments well and lived longer than we expected."</p>



<p>According to Dr. Vora, the study at Mayo Clinic is the first clinical trial of its kind investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging technology, including <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI targeting, for patients 65 and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.</p>



<p>The study included patients from Arizona and Minnesota. One of the study participants, Richard Casper, lived nearly two years longer than his prognosis. "I feel great. If someone didn't tell me I had the glioblastoma, I wouldn't even know it," reported Casper after undergoing treatment. He succumbed to the disease in 2023. "We miss our dad dearly," says his daughter, Susan Casper. "We will forever be grateful for the extra time we had with our father. The time gave us a chance to make memories that will last us a lifetime. It was also important to my father to participate in this study in hopes of helping others fight glioblastoma."</p>



<p>A larger, randomized clinical trial is now underway at Mayo Clinic. One of the study participants is Nadya El-Afandi, a wife and mother of four, who lives in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2022. El-Afandi is now 15 months post-treatment with no sign of glioblastoma. "I feel wonderful," says El-Afandi. "I've had my fourth MRI, and we're not seeing any return of the glioblastoma."</p>



<p>El-Afandi is back to her regular activities and just returned from a trip to Hawaii, where she spent time snorkeling and hiking. "We are living on the edge of medical miracles, and we are riding that tide. There's no cure for glioblastoma yet, but I've been able to take advantage of this medical opportunity, and it has given me a quality of life that is just outstanding," adds El-Afandi.</p>



<p>While El-Afandi's results are encouraging, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Breen, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist and principal investigator of the current study says it is too early to draw any conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the treatment until the study is complete. "Our goal is to transform the way we treat glioblastoma using shorter courses of radiation to minimize the burden on patients and their families and help them complete safe and effective treatment in a shorter amount of time."</p>



<p>The clinical trial, known as SAGA, or stereotactic ablative radiation treatment for glioblastoma, includes patients from Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. "We are now adding another component that builds upon Dr. Vora's work to help us best visualize the tumor," says Dr. Breen.</p>



<p>Meanwhile El-Afandi is focusing on living her life to the fullest. "I'm so grateful," says El-Afandi. "Every day is the best day, and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it."</p>



<p>The study was funded by The Kemper and Ethel Marley Fund in Cancer Research and the Lawrence W. and Marilyn W. Matteson Fund in Cancer Research.
