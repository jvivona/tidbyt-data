<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.</p>



<p>The protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.</p>



<p>"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study, detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11829009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>. "This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer."</p>



<p>T cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.</p>



<p>There are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:</p>



<p>CAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively. &nbsp;</p>



<p>TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.</p>



<p>NKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic <a href="http://10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/10/2/162/678013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tudy</a> had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.</p>



<p>Dr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-383780" style="width:218px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-196x300.jpg 196w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD.jpg 736w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells," says Dr. Billadeau. "We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression."</p>



<p>The manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.</p>

<p>At just 19, Angela Bristow's life took an unimaginable turn. A college student with her future ahead of her, she was thrust into a world of MRIs, surgeries and grueling treatments when diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ependymoma/cdc-20350144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ependymoma</a>, a cancer that typically affects the brain and spine. In her case, however, the tumor was located near her coccyx — an exceptionally rare location for this type of cancer.<br><br>"I'll never forget how difficult the recovery was after that first surgery to remove the tumor," Angela recalls. "I ended up with an infection while still recovering at home with my parents. I tried to go back to college afterward, but being away from my support system made everything so much harder."</p>



<p>Looking back on those early days, she shares, "Doctors didn't know what we were dealing with. I wasn't angry — I just kept going because that's all I could do."</p>



<p>Life regained some normalcy after her initial recovery. She met Chris — her future husband — and started planning a future. But less than a year into their marriage, the cancer returned, this time requiring surgery and 30 days of radiation. Two years later, the disease spread to her pelvic lymph nodes.</p>



<p>This marked a turning point. Angela sought a second opinion at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota">Mayo Clinic</a>, where her care team removed 13 lymph nodes, sparing her from further therapies. "Mayo became my anchor," she says. "For the first time, I felt like I wasn't fighting this alone."</p>



<p>Over the next two decades, Angela’s life became a cycle of surgeries, treatments and recoveries, as tumors returned every two years. Yet, she found strength in her "dream team" at Mayo Clinic, including her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-palliative-medicine-for-cancer-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">palliative care</a> team, who are dedicated to easing suffering by managing symptoms associated with serious illness. Beyond medical care, they provide compassionate support to patients and their loved ones during life's most trying moments.</p>



<p>"I have the distinct privilege of supporting Angela as she navigates the challenges of living with cancer," Dr. Liz Sokolowski, Angela’s palliative care physician, says. "From our first meeting, I was deeply moved by her resilience and strength, and how she continues to maintain hope and her sense of humor. Patients like Angela are true heroes. They teach us daily about courage, and they remind us why we do this work."</p>



<p>Advances in treatment provided new hope. What began with surgeries and radiation evolved into cryoablation, thermal ablation and, more recently, oral chemotherapy. Even when the cancer metastasized to her lungs a decade ago, Angela faced each recurrence with determination, balancing the fear of the unknown with acceptance. "Cancer doesn't own me," she affirms. "It's part of my story but not the whole story. I'm still learning, still growing and still fighting. There's a reason I'm here."</p>



<p>Angela's journey is one of resilience, self-advocacy and profound partnership — with her care team and her family. Chris has been her unwavering support, whether staying overnight in hospital chairs or managing wound care. Their daughter, now a teenager, has grown up witnessing her mother's courage. "She was just 3 months old when she stayed in my hospital room. She's my light, and Chris is my rock."</p>



<p>Now, at 48, Angela speaks with heartfelt wisdom.<br><br>"I wish I could tell my 19-year-old self it will be OK. Cancer doesn't define life; it's just a part of it," Angela says. For those walking a similar path, she offers this advice: "Advocate for yourself, build a trusted care team, and don’t let cancer take more than it has to. You are stronger than you think."<br><br><strong>Tips for navigating long-term cancer care</strong></p>



<p>Managing cancer can feel overwhelming, but with the right tools and mindset, balance and strength are possible. Whether you're newly diagnosed, in treatment or in remission, here are Angela's practical tips:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stay proactive with checkups.</strong><br>Maintain regular checkups with your healthcare team, even in remission. Work with your healthcare professional to set a personalized schedule for follow-ups and tests. Many hospitals offer apps or portals to help manage appointments and stay on top of your care.</li>



<li><strong>Explore integrative therapies.</strong><br>Cancer care extends beyond medical treatment. Services like acupuncture, meditation or aromatherapy can help manage side effects and improve well-being. Ask your care team about available options.</li>



<li><strong>Build a support network.</strong><br>A strong support system can make all the difference. Lean on family, friends or support groups to stay connected. If in-person groups feel daunting, consider online options or platforms like CaringBridge for sharing updates and receiving support.</li>



<li><strong>Consider clinical trials.</strong><br>Clinical trials can offer access to innovative treatments and contribute to advancing cancer care. For patients with rare cancers like ependymoma, organizations like Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN) provide valuable resources and information about ongoing trials. Speak with your oncologist to explore research organizations that may help guide your treatment options.</li>



<li><strong>Tap into health resources.</strong><br>Cancer education centers often provide free workshops, nutrition guidance and creative outlets like art therapy. These resources can keep you informed and engaged in your care.</li>



<li><strong>Care for your emotional health.</strong><br>Therapy offers a safe space to process emotions and build coping strategies. If traditional therapy isn't for you, mindfulness practices like deep breathing or meditation can reduce stress. Activities like a walk in the park, a lunch outing or a favorite hobby also can lift your spirits.</li>



<li><strong>Personalize your journey.</strong><br>Cancer is deeply personal, affecting everyone differently. Begin with one or two strategies that feel right for you, and gradually explore more as you're ready. Small, intentional steps can help you build a meaningful and well-supported life.</li>
</ol>



<p><br>Angela's story is a reminder that while cancer may shape your path, it doesn't define your destination.<br><br>"No matter what, there is always more life to live, more love to give and more reasons to keep fighting," Angela says.<br></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My 36-year-old sister recently noticed an unusual mole on her shoulder. She is scheduled for some tests. Her primary care physician believes it might be melanoma. What is melanoma? What treatment options are available, and is surgery necessary? Have there been recent advancements in treatments? &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;While melanoma is much less common than other types of skin cancer, it is the most serious because it is more likely to metastasize, or spread, to other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">Melanoma</a>&nbsp;starts in the melanocytes, which are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The first signs of melanoma often are either a change in an existing mole or the development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ABCDE guide helps you determine if a mole or a spot may indicate melanoma or another type of skin cancer:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A is for asymmetrical shape.</strong>&nbsp;One half is unlike the other half.</li>



<li><strong>B is for border.</strong>&nbsp;Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders.</li>



<li><strong>C is for color.</strong>&nbsp;Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color.</li>



<li><strong>D is for diameter.</strong>&nbsp;Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters, or the diameter of a pencil eraser).</li>



<li><strong>E is for evolving.</strong>&nbsp;Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height, especially if part or all of the mole turns black. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you notice any of these signs, make an appointment with your primary care clinician or a healthcare professional.</p>



<p>A few types of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374888">tests are used to diagnose melanoma</a>. The first is a punch biopsy performed with a circular blade pressed into the skin around the suspicious mole. Another technique is called an excisional biopsy, which uses a scalpel to remove the entire mole and a very tiny bit of normal skin around it. It’s also important to have a total skin exam at the initial diagnosis because some patients will have a second primary melanoma found at the same time.</p>



<p>Once melanoma is diagnosed, your care team will determine the extent of the cancer by measuring its thickness, identifying whether it has spread to the lymph nodes and looking for signs of cancer beyond the skin. If there's a chance the cancer could spread to nearby lymph nodes, you might need a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sentinel-node-biopsy/about/pac-20385264">sentinel node biopsy</a>. During this procedure, dye is injected into the area where your melanoma was removed and flows to the closest lymph node or nodes. Those lymph nodes, called the sentinel lymph nodes, are removed and tested for cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding the stage of melanoma will help your healthcare team create a treatment plan. Melanoma treatment often starts with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advances-in-surgery-are-improving-survival-for-people-with-melanoma/">surgery</a> to remove the cancer. The treatment for thinner melanomas generally removes the melanoma with a margin of tissue, typically 1 to 2 centimeters of normal tissue. If the sentinel lymph node biopsy determines that the cancer has spread or your melanoma grows deeper into the skin, active surveillance with imaging, additional surgery and/or systemic treatment may be recommended.</p>



<p>Other treatments include radiation therapy and systemic therapy.&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advances-in-surgery-are-improving-survival-for-people-with-melanoma/">Recent advancements have significantly improved the prognosis</a>&nbsp;for patients diagnosed with melanoma. These include targeted therapies, an approach that uses medicine that attacks specific chemicals in cancer cells, and immunotherapies, which use medicines that help the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Either option might be recommended for selected patients. Some patients also may benefit from systemic therapy before an operation.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/07/clinical-trials-a-significant-part-of-cancer-care/">Clinical trials</a>&nbsp;have led to recent advancements in melanoma treatment because physician-scientists can test new and better approaches. Efforts are being made to enhance the accessibility and ease of patient participation in clinical trials. If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial, ask your care team about what options might be available.</p>



<p>While melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer, you can reduce your risk. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is considered the leading cause of melanoma. UV light comes from the sun and tanning lamps and beds. You can reduce your risk by avoiding tanning beds, wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, avoiding sun exposure during peak hours (10 a.m.–3 p.m.) and wearing sun protective gear outdoors. Use about 1 ounce of sunscreen and reapply every two hours, or more if you've been sweating or swimming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you notice rapidly growing or changing skin lesions, it's important to notify your primary care physician or a care team member. The earlier melanoma is found, the better the chance of successful treatment. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20055458"><strong><em>Tina Hieken, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Breast and Melanoma Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

"Every experience with cancer is&nbsp;unique, and it will take all of us,&nbsp;united, to create a world where we look beyond the disease and see the person before the patient. This World Cancer Day let's come together to rewrite the future of cancer care — one where the needs of people and communities come first," states the campaign website.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;celebrates World Cancer Day and recognizes the unique experiences of each person under its care.

<p>Sally Blackwell experienced constipation and lack of weight gain while she was pregnant with her second child. After her child's birth, her symptoms worsened but were dismissed as hemorrhoids. Then, at 33, she was diagnosed with rectal cancer at Mayo Clinic. The lifesaving care she received inspired her to become a social worker at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>"About 100,000 cases of cancer each year in the United States are due to alcohol consumption — and about 20,000 deaths. So this isn't a small problem," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>He says alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., behind <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tobacco use</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>.</p>



<p>"The risk starts with actually relatively low intakes of alcohol over a long period of time," says Dr. Hensrud. "Consuming it once in a while probably isn't going to increase the risk that much. But there are many people who consume it regularly, and there are many people who assume that there are health benefits on the heart. And these benefits probably aren't as strong as what we used to believe."</p>



<p>He says when drinking alcohol is combined with tobacco use, the risk of cancer increases significantly.</p>



<p>"Some studies have suggested the optimal amount of alcohol for people less than 50 is zero. So we need to dial back, I think, a little bit on our alcohol consumption. Be aware of it. An occasional drink of alcohol is not going to increase long-term risk, but we need to be aware of it and keep a lid on our consumption over time," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>

<p>"There is a condition called acute alcoholic&nbsp;hepatitis,&nbsp;where the alcohol triggers an acute inflammatory process in the liver, and patients can become really quite sick, quite quickly," he says.</p>



<p>And it's rising among young people.</p>



<p>"Some of the more tragic cases of&nbsp;liver&nbsp;disease related to alcohol received now are due to young individuals who consume excessively, or binge alcohol," says Dr. Keaveny.</p>



<p>Alcoholic hepatitis can develop quickly. Symptoms can include jaundice, confusion, nausea and vomiting.</p>



<p>"They can present with multiple complications of their liver disease, which requires really a multidisciplinary approach to address and manage their issues," he says.</p>



<p>Treating alcoholic hepatitis requires an assessment of liver damage and complications, and addressing the patient's alcohol use disorder. Dr. Keaveny says corticosteroids may be used, but they have limited effectiveness and risks. The next step may be transplant.</p>



<p>"We consider patients for liver transplantation who have acute alcoholic hepatitis. This requires a very careful assessment of multiple factors, their medical, social and psychological factors, to determine whether they may be eligible for liver transplantation," Dr. Keaveny says.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month.</strong></em></p>



<p>When it comes to healthcare screening, different healthcare guideline organizations may have different recommendations. The same is true for cervical cancer screening.</p>



<p>Cervical cancer is almost always caused by a persistent infection with high-risk strains of HPV. Routine screening has dramatically reduced cervical cancer deaths, and regular screenings are essential because early detection makes precancer treatment more effective.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/maclaughlin-kathy-l-m-d/bio-20199426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kathy MacLaughlin</a>, a Mayo Clinic family physician specializing in cervical cancer prevention, says Mayo Clinic follows U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations.</p>



<p>"They recommend screening for 21- to 65-year-olds, either with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap smear</a>&nbsp;every three years or, starting at age 30, the Pap/HPV co-test, or the primary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hpv-test/about/pac-20394355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV test</a>&nbsp;every five years," she says.</p>



<p>Starting February 5, Mayo Clinic practices in the Midwest will offer a FDA-approved <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-improving-cervical-cancer-screening-with-hpv-self-collection-tests/">self-collection HPV test</a> to help reduce barriers to screening. This service will later expand to Mayo Clinic in Arizona and Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/Z58PGJPSUUU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: Dr. Kathy MacLaughlin talks about screening for cervical cancer</a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Name super/CG: Kathy MacLaughlin, M.D./Family Medicine/Mayo Clinic.</strong></p>



<p>For women ages 21–65, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Screening for cervical cancer every three years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years.</li>



<li>For women aged 30 to 65, screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing alone, or every five years with hrHPV testing combined with cytology (co-testing).<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says the current guidelines suggest that after age 65, if you've had past negative/normal screening, particularly important in the prior 10 years, it's OK for most people to stop screening, but that might not always be the case.</p>



<p>"People who have previously had precancers (CIN-2 or CIN-3) treated with a procedure called LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) should not stop screening. If someone is immunocompromised or has had cervical cancer, they should not stop screening. Or if they've had in utero DES (diethylstilbestrol) exposure, they should not stop screening. To exit screening after age 65, there should be none of those risk factors. And then you also need 10 years of either three negative Paps or two negative HPV tests to say, yes, you are done," she says.</p>



<p>If you're unsure if you should be screened, consult your healthcare team to determine what's best for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk and prevention for cervical cancer</h2>



<p>"Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus infection, or HPV, is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers. Anyone with a cervix who is sexually active is at risk, particularly if they haven't had the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-protecting-kids-from-cancer-with-hpv-vaccine/">HPV vaccine series</a>," says Dr. MacLaughlin.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/HPV-vaccine-vial-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="vial of human papillomavirus vaccine" class="wp-image-103619" style="width:652px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/HPV-vaccine-vial-16-x-9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/HPV-vaccine-vial-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/10/HPV-vaccine-vial-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>Along with HPV, other risk factors for cervical cancer include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Smoking tobacco</li>



<li>Lack of screening</li>



<li>Multiple sexual partners</li>
</ul>



<p>Preventing cervical cancer involves three steps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HPV vaccination is most effective if given to preteens/teens (females and males), but it is routinely recommended for all 9-26-year-olds and available through a shared decision-making discussion with your clinician for 27-45-year-olds (females and males).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Get screened at recommended intervals.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Appropriate management of abnormal screening results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens with your HPV self-collection results?</h2>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says about 85%-90% of people will test negative or not have HPV. They will be advised to have repeat testing in three years — though that could change with future guideline updates to five-year interval screening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for those with positive HPV test results, further testing will be needed.&nbsp;<br><br>Different types of high-risk HPV are being screened for, she says.</p>



<p>"HPV 16 and HPV 18 are the highest of the high risk. They cause 70% of cervical cancers. If either of those is found on the HPV self-collection test, the patient will need a referral to colposcopy, which is an outpatient procedure where the cervix is looked at under a microscope," says Dr. MacLaughlin. "Some small biopsies might be taken from the cervical tissue to ensure that there's not precancer."</p>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin explains that if other types of HPV are found on the self-collection test (not HPV 16, not HPV 18), the patient will need to return to the clinic for a Pap test to complete their cervical cancer screening, as that information is necessary to guide the next steps. She says there is a difference from a clinician-collected cervical sample for HPV testing because the lab can add a Pap test to the sample of cervical cells but cannot run a Pap test on vaginal samples. This is expected to happen about 10% of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is updating its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/document/draft-evidence-review/cervical-cancer-screening-adults-adolescents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommendations</a>. In its draft recommendation statement, it endorses the HPV self-collection option for people aged 30 to 65.</p>

<p>Traditional cancer screening involves a clinician-collected cervical sample for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap</a>&nbsp;and/or HPV test. A new option will hopefully get more people screened.</p>



<p>"We're calling it the HPV self-collection test. The difference is that instead of your clinician putting in a speculum and doing a swab of the cervix, the patient would use a self-collection device to get a vaginal sample to test for HPV," says Dr. MacLaughlin.</p>



<p></p>

<p>The HPV self-collection test is done in a healthcare setting</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>She says the test is quick and painless. It's aimed at people facing barriers to having a speculum exam. For example, those with disabilities, mobility issues, cultural or religious reasons, or a history of trauma. The test is done privately in a healthcare setting, such as an exam room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the self-collection test works</h2>



<p>"The device is inserted, just like a tampon into the vagina, and the little plastic wings on the side of the device control the insertion depth, so people don't have to worry about pushing it in too far. And then they would take the plunger and push that in, and that extends the sampling brush. This is a very soft, dry bristle brush. And then the handle needs to be rotated five times, and it clicks. You can hear the click. You can feel the clicks, so you know you've done enough turns. Once that has been done, the patient would remove the entire device and just retract the brush and cap it, and this will get sent to the lab for the testing," Dr. MacLaughlin explains.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team to determine which test is best for you. The most important thing is to get screened.<br><br>"The beauty of screening is that we're catching things before it is cancer, when it's still treatable as a precancer," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says that, for now, the self-collection screening must be done in a healthcare setting and is not for at-home use. However, this is anticipated to change in upcoming years, and eventually, home-based self-collection should be approved.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Script-MCM-What-to-know-about-MRI-for-dense-breasts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong></p>



<p>"The first thing to know if you get notified is that dense breast tissue is completely normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of all women will have dense tissue," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>He says dense breasts are identified through a mammogram. Additional testing is the next step.</p>



<p>"The most widely available supplemental screening test for women with dense tissues is probably an ultrasound of the breast or an MRI," says Dr. Sharpe. "There have been lots of studies showing that MRI is the most sensitive test for finding breast cancer."</p>



<p>An MRI is meant to be used along with a mammogram, not instead.</p>



<p>"MRI is the most sensitive test we have for finding breast cancer. It can see through density. It can find hard-to-see, small cancers," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>But it's not for everyone. You'll lie face down on a table and then guided into the MRI machine."Some patients that have challenges with claustrophobia might struggle to be comfortable in the smaller space&nbsp;of the MRI scanner," explains Dr. Sharpe.</p>

<p>The benefit is clear, he says.</p>



<p>"Women with dense tissue or high risk for breast cancer that undergo breast MRI, we are able to see cancers that would be hiding from the mammogram."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supplemental screening options</h2>



<p>Other supplemental screening options include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging (MBI)</a>, ultrasound and contrast-enhanced mammography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Sharpe says choosing what screening method works for you is an individual decision that should be made with your healthcare team, but he says it's important to start with your annual screening.</p>



<p>"The most important thing for women to know is that you should get your annual mammogram, starting at age 40. Also, if you have dense tissue, consider a supplemental screening, another imaging test looking at the breast tissues in a different way — and you should get that exam regularly as well," he says.</p>

<p>It may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it is reality. Mayo Clinic researchers are developing personalized lung cancer vaccines.</p>



<p>"We actually make a vaccine that's specific for each individual's cancers," says Dr. Knutson.</p>

<p>The process involves analyzing cancer cells to create a one-of-a-kind vaccine.</p>



<p>"We can take a small part of that cancer and sequence that cancer and get the information that we need to design the vaccine," he explains.</p>



<p>The vaccine uses the immune system to identify and combat cancer.</p>



<p>"We can use that vaccine to hopefully prevent the disease from coming back, or we can use it to help shrink a tumor when given with other types of therapies," Dr. Knutson says.</p>



<p>You can reduce your risk of lung cancer by quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>
