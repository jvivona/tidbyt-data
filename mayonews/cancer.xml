The colon and rectum are two different parts of the lower digestive tract.

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (0:55) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network.</strong>" <strong>Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Script-MCM-Colon-and-Rectal-Cancer.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Colon and rectal cancers may be detected during the same&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>, but they are treated differently, says Dr. Eric Dozois.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our approach to rectal cancer, for example, often involves more aggressive treatments that help prevent it from coming back," says Dr. Dozois.</p>



<p>Innovation plays a strong role in rectal cancer surgery at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.</p>



<p>Robotic surgery allows your surgeon to work more efficiently in small spaces, providing an enhanced view of the area where the operation is taking place. Some of the benefits include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Surgery performed while the surgeon sits at a console and uses controls to guide high-tech surgical tools.</li>



<li>Allows surgeons to work in small spaces with three-dimensional visualization, and with more precision, flexibility and control than with conventional techniques.</li>



<li>Minimally invasive, fewer complications, quicker recovery, fewer urological complications and may reduce nerve dysfunction.</li>
</ul>



<p>"We're using laparoscopic and robotic platforms to really offer patients surgery that is most up to date in terms of minimally invasive techniques, the least amount of trauma to the patient, but yet achieving the goals of surgery to remove the cancer," he says.</p>



<p>If colon cancer is caught early, surgery may be the only treatment that is necessary, but Dr. Dozois says, "Even in some of the earlier stages, a more aggressive approach that combines chemotherapy, radiation and surgery is necessary to keep it not only from coming back locally, but from spreading to other parts of the body."</p>

<p>Early detection is critical for improving cancer survival rates, yet pancreatic cancer remains challenging to detect. Exciting new research offers hope as artificial intelligence (AI) models demonstrate the potential to detect pancreatic cancer earlier and with remarkable accuracy. Explore these groundbreaking advancements in a new episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodeseven&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=190206">Tomorrow's Cure</a>.</p>



<p>The latest episode features insights from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goenka-ajit-h-m-d/bio-20152402?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ajit Goenka</a>,&nbsp;radiologist and professor of radiology at Mayo Clinic's Comprehensive Cancer Center, and <a href="https://faculty.mdanderson.org/profiles/suresh_chari.html">Dr. Suresh&nbsp;Chari</a>, professor, Department of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition in the Division of Internal Medicine at MD Anderson Cancer Center.</p>



<p>"These small cancers are very difficult to detect on imaging," says Dr. Goenka. "So the challenge with these small cancers is that they look exactly similar to what the rest of the pancreas would look like, and unless you are deeply suspicious and you're looking very carefully, you are likely to overlook that."</p>



<p>Recognizing that early detection is the best hope for improving survival rates, researchers have developed AI models capable of identifying cancers. These models have shown immense promise, identifying pancreatic cancer on CT scans at stages where surgical intervention can still promise a cure.</p>

<p>"Early detection is really our best hope, but also our biggest challenge when it comes to pancreas cancer," states Dr. Goenka.</p>



<p>Dr. Chari further elaborates on the urgency of improving detection timelines. "We are trying to diagnose pancreatic cancer earlier. The challenge we have been facing is that half of patients have stage 4 at the time of diagnosis," he explains. "We want to reduce the number of stage 4 patients. Our early detection strategy would automatically shift everybody to an earlier stage. Right now, only 7% of pancreatic cancers are confined to the pancreas at the time of diagnosis. We want to triple that number, so we came up with a number of four months. If you diagnose all pancreatic cancers four months before they were clinically diagnosed, we would significantly shift the stage to an earlier stage." These advancements mark an exciting step forward in the fight against pancreatic cancer.

<p>Meningiomas are usually noncancerous <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/meningioma-specialty-group/overview/ovc-20440783">tumors</a> that form in the membranes surrounding the brain. It may sound strange, but some of these tumors may not need treatment.<br><br>"But for the ones that grow or for the ones that cause symptoms, they do require treatment, which is either surgery and/or radiation," says Dr. Clark.</p>



<p>The goal of the surgery is to take out as much of the tumor as possible.</p>



<p>"Meningiomas have this tendency to enwrap very critical structures, like the types of nerves that control sight or control hearing, facial expression, and also encircle around critical blood vessels," she says.</p>



<p>Better tools allow for better outcomes.</p>



<p>"We have what's called navigation. So that allows us to use a pre-op MRI, sort of a GPS for the brain, to know exactly where the tumor is in relationship to the structures that we're trying to preserve and avoid," says Dr. Clark.</p>



<p>Advanced imaging tools used in the operating room help ensure surgeons remove all the tumor.</p>



<p>"Brain surgery is much safer with all of these wonderful new technologies," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Research</h2>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I recently read that more and more young people are getting diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-why-millennials-should-know-colon-cancer-symptoms/">colorectal cancer</a>. I'm in my 30s, am I at risk? What does colorectal mean?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;The term colorectal cancer combines&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884">rectal cancer</a>, two parts of the intestine. The first part of the large intestine is called the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/colon-and-rectum/img-20007597">colon</a>, and the last part refers to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/colon-and-rectum/img-20007597">rectum</a>.&nbsp;These two divisions of colorectal cancer are important because they're often treated differently. Cancers of the colon, for example, may initially be treated through surgery. With cancers of the rectum, we may do treatment long before someone goes to surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Symptoms of both cancers are similar and can include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>, overall changes in bowel characteristics such as more frequent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>, blood from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">rectum</a>&nbsp;or in the stool and ongoing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>, cramps or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/symptoms-causes/syc-20372709">gas</a>.&nbsp;These symptoms&nbsp;can be embarrassing for some people to talk about, and that is normal. However, it is extremely important if you have any of those symptoms to share it with your healthcare team. Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer increases your chance of survival.</p>



<p>People of all ages are at risk for colorectal cancer. It is true that there have been increased rates of colon and rectal cancer in younger patients, which has led to a shift in screening recommendations. We used to start screening average-risk individuals at age 50, but because of this new trend, we're now encouraging average-risk individuals to start screening at age 45. Through screening, we can prevent the development of cancer and capture&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875">polyps</a>&nbsp;(precancerous growths) even before symptoms start.</p>



<p>It is unknown what has caused this increase among young people. Findings show that it may be an environmental factor. Over the last 50 years, we've seen major changes in diet.&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">Ultraprocessed foods</a>&nbsp;and higher quantities of red meats have potentially led to some negative changes to the bacteria that are normally in our gut, making it not as protective as it once was. A decrease in exercise and an increase in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">obesity</a>&nbsp;also could be contributing factors. Living a healthylifestyle is critical —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&nbsp;and a well-rounded&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/basics/healthy-diets/hlv-20049477#:~:text=Includes%20a%20variety%20of%20foods,and%20seeds%3B%20and%20healthy%20fats.">diet</a>&nbsp;can help protect you.</p>



<p>We typically divide people into two groups — those who are at average risk and those who are at high risk for colorectal cancer. Average-risk individuals are people who don't have any associated symptoms that would be linked to colorectal cancer or have any of the factors that would place them at high risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For those who are at high risk, there tends to be at least one of three variables:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>A medical condition that places them at higher risk.</li>



<li>A genetic condition that increases their risk.&nbsp;</li>



<li>A family history that places them at higher risk. For example, a first-degree family member such as parents or siblings who have a diagnosis of colorectal cancer or advanced polyps.</li>
</ol>



<p>Any of those three components would place you at higher risk, and therefore, you should start screening sooner and possibly more often than average-risk individuals.</p>



<p>When it comes to cancer care, we try to make our efforts personalized, particularly with rectal cancer. The treatment team consists of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/oncology/home/orc-20198222">oncologist</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/colon-rectal-surgery/home/orc-20312712">surgeon</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiation-oncology/home/orc-20188588">radiation oncologist</a>&nbsp;who help direct what the next best step would be for you, whether that's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033">chemotherapy</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/discovery-translation-labs/cancer-research/cancer-immunotherapy">immunotherapies</a>, surgery or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162">radiation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any delay in sharing information translates to a delay in diagnosis, which can lead to later-stage cancer. It is the later-stage cancers that can be a bit more challenging to treat. Don't delay in making an appointment.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;<strong>Derek Ebner, M.D.,&nbsp;</strong></em><strong><em>Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><em></em></p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.</p>



<p>The protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.</p>



<p>"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study, detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11829009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>. "This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer."</p>



<p>T cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.</p>



<p>There are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:</p>



<p>CAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively. &nbsp;</p>



<p>TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.</p>



<p>NKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic <a href="http://10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/10/2/162/678013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tudy</a> had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.</p>



<p>Dr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-383780" style="width:218px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-196x300.jpg 196w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD.jpg 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells," says Dr. Billadeau. "We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression."</p>



<p>The manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.</p>

<p>At just 19, Angela Bristow's life took an unimaginable turn. A college student with her future ahead of her, she was thrust into a world of MRIs, surgeries and grueling treatments when diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ependymoma/cdc-20350144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ependymoma</a>, a cancer that typically affects the brain and spine. In her case, however, the tumor was located near her coccyx — an exceptionally rare location for this type of cancer.<br><br>"I'll never forget how difficult the recovery was after that first surgery to remove the tumor," Angela recalls. "I ended up with an infection while still recovering at home with my parents. I tried to go back to college afterward, but being away from my support system made everything so much harder."</p>



<p>Looking back on those early days, she shares, "Doctors didn't know what we were dealing with. I wasn't angry — I just kept going because that's all I could do."</p>



<p>Life regained some normalcy after her initial recovery. She met Chris — her future husband — and started planning a future. But less than a year into their marriage, the cancer returned, this time requiring surgery and 30 days of radiation. Two years later, the disease spread to her pelvic lymph nodes.</p>



<p>This marked a turning point. Angela sought a second opinion at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota">Mayo Clinic</a>, where her care team removed 13 lymph nodes, sparing her from further therapies. "Mayo became my anchor," she says. "For the first time, I felt like I wasn't fighting this alone."</p>



<p>Over the next two decades, Angela’s life became a cycle of surgeries, treatments and recoveries, as tumors returned every two years. Yet, she found strength in her "dream team" at Mayo Clinic, including her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-palliative-medicine-for-cancer-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">palliative care</a> team, who are dedicated to easing suffering by managing symptoms associated with serious illness. Beyond medical care, they provide compassionate support to patients and their loved ones during life's most trying moments.</p>



<p>"I have the distinct privilege of supporting Angela as she navigates the challenges of living with cancer," Dr. Liz Sokolowski, Angela’s palliative care physician, says. "From our first meeting, I was deeply moved by her resilience and strength, and how she continues to maintain hope and her sense of humor. Patients like Angela are true heroes. They teach us daily about courage, and they remind us why we do this work."</p>



<p>Advances in treatment provided new hope. What began with surgeries and radiation evolved into cryoablation, thermal ablation and, more recently, oral chemotherapy. Even when the cancer metastasized to her lungs a decade ago, Angela faced each recurrence with determination, balancing the fear of the unknown with acceptance. "Cancer doesn't own me," she affirms. "It's part of my story but not the whole story. I'm still learning, still growing and still fighting. There's a reason I'm here."</p>



<p>Angela's journey is one of resilience, self-advocacy and profound partnership — with her care team and her family. Chris has been her unwavering support, whether staying overnight in hospital chairs or managing wound care. Their daughter, now a teenager, has grown up witnessing her mother's courage. "She was just 3 months old when she stayed in my hospital room. She's my light, and Chris is my rock."</p>



<p>Now, at 48, Angela speaks with heartfelt wisdom.<br><br>"I wish I could tell my 19-year-old self it will be OK. Cancer doesn't define life; it's just a part of it," Angela says. For those walking a similar path, she offers this advice: "Advocate for yourself, build a trusted care team, and don’t let cancer take more than it has to. You are stronger than you think."<br><br><strong>Tips for navigating long-term cancer care</strong></p>



<p>Managing cancer can feel overwhelming, but with the right tools and mindset, balance and strength are possible. Whether you're newly diagnosed, in treatment or in remission, here are Angela's practical tips:</p>



<ol start="1" class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stay proactive with checkups.</strong><br>Maintain regular checkups with your healthcare team, even in remission. Work with your healthcare professional to set a personalized schedule for follow-ups and tests. Many hospitals offer apps or portals to help manage appointments and stay on top of your care.</li>



<li><strong>Explore integrative therapies.</strong><br>Cancer care extends beyond medical treatment. Services like acupuncture, meditation or aromatherapy can help manage side effects and improve well-being. Ask your care team about available options.</li>



<li><strong>Build a support network.</strong><br>A strong support system can make all the difference. Lean on family, friends or support groups to stay connected. If in-person groups feel daunting, consider online options or platforms like CaringBridge for sharing updates and receiving support.</li>



<li><strong>Consider clinical trials.</strong><br>Clinical trials can offer access to innovative treatments and contribute to advancing cancer care. For patients with rare cancers like ependymoma, organizations like Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN) provide valuable resources and information about ongoing trials. Speak with your oncologist to explore research organizations that may help guide your treatment options.</li>



<li><strong>Tap into health resources.</strong><br>Cancer education centers often provide free workshops, nutrition guidance and creative outlets like art therapy. These resources can keep you informed and engaged in your care.</li>



<li><strong>Care for your emotional health.</strong><br>Therapy offers a safe space to process emotions and build coping strategies. If traditional therapy isn't for you, mindfulness practices like deep breathing or meditation can reduce stress. Activities like a walk in the park, a lunch outing or a favorite hobby also can lift your spirits.</li>



<li><strong>Personalize your journey.</strong><br>Cancer is deeply personal, affecting everyone differently. Begin with one or two strategies that feel right for you, and gradually explore more as you're ready. Small, intentional steps can help you build a meaningful and well-supported life.</li>
</ol>



<p><br>Angela's story is a reminder that while cancer may shape your path, it doesn't define your destination.<br><br>"No matter what, there is always more life to live, more love to give and more reasons to keep fighting," Angela says.<br></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My 36-year-old sister recently noticed an unusual mole on her shoulder. She is scheduled for some tests. Her primary care physician believes it might be melanoma. What is melanoma? What treatment options are available, and is surgery necessary? Have there been recent advancements in treatments? &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;While melanoma is much less common than other types of skin cancer, it is the most serious because it is more likely to metastasize, or spread, to other parts of the body.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">Melanoma</a>&nbsp;starts in the melanocytes, which are cells that make the pigment that gives skin its color. The first signs of melanoma often are either a change in an existing mole or the development of a new pigmented or unusual-looking growth on the skin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The ABCDE guide helps you determine if a mole or a spot may indicate melanoma or another type of skin cancer:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A is for asymmetrical shape.</strong>&nbsp;One half is unlike the other half.</li>



<li><strong>B is for border.</strong>&nbsp;Look for moles with irregular, notched or scalloped borders.</li>



<li><strong>C is for color.</strong>&nbsp;Look for growths that have changed color, have many colors or have uneven color.</li>



<li><strong>D is for diameter.</strong>&nbsp;Look for new growth in a mole larger than 1/4 inch (about 6 millimeters, or the diameter of a pencil eraser).</li>



<li><strong>E is for evolving.</strong>&nbsp;Watch for moles that change in size, shape, color or height, especially if part or all of the mole turns black. Moles may also evolve to develop new signs and symptoms, such as itchiness or bleeding.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you notice any of these signs, make an appointment with your primary care clinician or a healthcare professional.</p>



<p>A few types of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374888">tests are used to diagnose melanoma</a>. The first is a punch biopsy performed with a circular blade pressed into the skin around the suspicious mole. Another technique is called an excisional biopsy, which uses a scalpel to remove the entire mole and a very tiny bit of normal skin around it. It’s also important to have a total skin exam at the initial diagnosis because some patients will have a second primary melanoma found at the same time.</p>



<p>Once melanoma is diagnosed, your care team will determine the extent of the cancer by measuring its thickness, identifying whether it has spread to the lymph nodes and looking for signs of cancer beyond the skin. If there's a chance the cancer could spread to nearby lymph nodes, you might need a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sentinel-node-biopsy/about/pac-20385264">sentinel node biopsy</a>. During this procedure, dye is injected into the area where your melanoma was removed and flows to the closest lymph node or nodes. Those lymph nodes, called the sentinel lymph nodes, are removed and tested for cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Understanding the stage of melanoma will help your healthcare team create a treatment plan. Melanoma treatment often starts with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advances-in-surgery-are-improving-survival-for-people-with-melanoma/">surgery</a> to remove the cancer. The treatment for thinner melanomas generally removes the melanoma with a margin of tissue, typically 1 to 2 centimeters of normal tissue. If the sentinel lymph node biopsy determines that the cancer has spread or your melanoma grows deeper into the skin, active surveillance with imaging, additional surgery and/or systemic treatment may be recommended.</p>



<p>Other treatments include radiation therapy and systemic therapy.&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advances-in-surgery-are-improving-survival-for-people-with-melanoma/">Recent advancements have significantly improved the prognosis</a>&nbsp;for patients diagnosed with melanoma. These include targeted therapies, an approach that uses medicine that attacks specific chemicals in cancer cells, and immunotherapies, which use medicines that help the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Either option might be recommended for selected patients. Some patients also may benefit from systemic therapy before an operation.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/07/clinical-trials-a-significant-part-of-cancer-care/">Clinical trials</a>&nbsp;have led to recent advancements in melanoma treatment because physician-scientists can test new and better approaches. Efforts are being made to enhance the accessibility and ease of patient participation in clinical trials. If you are interested in participating in a clinical trial, ask your care team about what options might be available.</p>



<p>While melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer, you can reduce your risk. Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is considered the leading cause of melanoma. UV light comes from the sun and tanning lamps and beds. You can reduce your risk by avoiding tanning beds, wearing broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher, avoiding sun exposure during peak hours (10 a.m.–3 p.m.) and wearing sun protective gear outdoors. Use about 1 ounce of sunscreen and reapply every two hours, or more if you've been sweating or swimming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you notice rapidly growing or changing skin lesions, it's important to notify your primary care physician or a care team member. The earlier melanoma is found, the better the chance of successful treatment. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20055458"><strong><em>Tina Hieken, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Breast and Melanoma Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>"About 100,000 cases of cancer each year in the United States are due to alcohol consumption — and about 20,000 deaths. So this isn't a small problem," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>He says alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., behind <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tobacco use</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>.</p>



<p>"The risk starts with actually relatively low intakes of alcohol over a long period of time," says Dr. Hensrud. "Consuming it once in a while probably isn't going to increase the risk that much. But there are many people who consume it regularly, and there are many people who assume that there are health benefits on the heart. And these benefits probably aren't as strong as what we used to believe."</p>



<p>He says when drinking alcohol is combined with tobacco use, the risk of cancer increases significantly.</p>



<p>"Some studies have suggested the optimal amount of alcohol for people less than 50 is zero. So we need to dial back, I think, a little bit on our alcohol consumption. Be aware of it. An occasional drink of alcohol is not going to increase long-term risk, but we need to be aware of it and keep a lid on our consumption over time," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>

<p>"Alcohol&nbsp;can cause liver damage. And in some individuals who drink excessively, it can result in significant complications," says Dr. Keaveny.</p>



<p>Sustained alcohol use can result in alcohol-related liver disease.</p>

<p>"There is a condition called acute alcoholic&nbsp;hepatitis,&nbsp;where the alcohol triggers an acute inflammatory process in the liver, and patients can become really quite sick, quite quickly," he says.</p>



<p>And it's rising among young people.</p>



<p>"Some of the more tragic cases of&nbsp;liver&nbsp;disease related to alcohol received now are due to young individuals who consume excessively, or binge alcohol," says Dr. Keaveny.</p>



<p>Alcoholic hepatitis can develop quickly. Symptoms can include jaundice, confusion, nausea and vomiting.</p>



<p>"They can present with multiple complications of their liver disease, which requires really a multidisciplinary approach to address and manage their issues," he says.</p>



<p>Treating alcoholic hepatitis requires an assessment of liver damage and complications, and addressing the patient's alcohol use disorder. Dr. Keaveny says corticosteroids may be used, but they have limited effectiveness and risks. The next step may be transplant.</p>



<p>"We consider patients for liver transplantation who have acute alcoholic hepatitis. This requires a very careful assessment of multiple factors, their medical, social and psychological factors, to determine whether they may be eligible for liver transplantation," Dr. Keaveny says.</p>
