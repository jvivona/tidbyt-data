<p>"About 100,000 cases of cancer each year in the United States are due to alcohol consumption — and about 20,000 deaths. So this isn't a small problem," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>He says alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., behind <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tobacco use</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>.</p>



<p>"The risk starts with actually relatively low intakes of alcohol over a long period of time," says Dr. Hensrud. "Consuming it once in a while probably isn't going to increase the risk that much. But there are many people who consume it regularly, and there are many people who assume that there are health benefits on the heart. And these benefits probably aren't as strong as what we used to believe."</p>



<p>He says when drinking alcohol is combined with tobacco use, the risk of cancer increases significantly.</p>



<p>"Some studies have suggested the optimal amount of alcohol for people less than 50 is zero. So we need to dial back, I think, a little bit on our alcohol consumption. Be aware of it. An occasional drink of alcohol is not going to increase long-term risk, but we need to be aware of it and keep a lid on our consumption over time," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>

<p>"Alcohol&nbsp;can cause liver damage. And in some individuals who drink excessively, it can result in significant complications," says Dr. Keaveny.</p>



<p>Sustained alcohol use can result in alcohol-related liver disease.</p>

<p>"There is a condition called acute alcoholic&nbsp;hepatitis,&nbsp;where the alcohol triggers an acute inflammatory process in the liver, and patients can become really quite sick, quite quickly," he says.</p>



<p>And it's rising among young people.</p>



<p>"Some of the more tragic cases of&nbsp;liver&nbsp;disease related to alcohol received now are due to young individuals who consume excessively, or binge alcohol," says Dr. Keaveny.</p>



<p>Alcoholic hepatitis can develop quickly. Symptoms can include jaundice, confusion, nausea and vomiting.</p>



<p>"They can present with multiple complications of their liver disease, which requires really a multidisciplinary approach to address and manage their issues," he says.</p>



<p>Treating alcoholic hepatitis requires an assessment of liver damage and complications, and addressing the patient's alcohol use disorder. Dr. Keaveny says corticosteroids may be used, but they have limited effectiveness and risks. The next step may be transplant.</p>



<p>"We consider patients for liver transplantation who have acute alcoholic hepatitis. This requires a very careful assessment of multiple factors, their medical, social and psychological factors, to determine whether they may be eligible for liver transplantation," Dr. Keaveny says.</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note: January is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month.</strong></em></p>



<p>When it comes to healthcare screening, different healthcare guideline organizations may have different recommendations. The same is true for cervical cancer screening.</p>



<p>Cervical cancer is almost always caused by a persistent infection with high-risk strains of HPV. Routine screening has dramatically reduced cervical cancer deaths, and regular screenings are essential because early detection makes precancer treatment more effective.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/maclaughlin-kathy-l-m-d/bio-20199426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kathy MacLaughlin</a>, a Mayo Clinic family physician specializing in cervical cancer prevention, says Mayo Clinic follows U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations.</p>



<p>"They recommend screening for 21- to 65-year-olds, either with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap smear</a>&nbsp;every three years or, starting at age 30, the Pap/HPV co-test, or the primary&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hpv-test/about/pac-20394355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HPV test</a>&nbsp;every five years," she says.</p>



<p>Starting February 5, Mayo Clinic practices in the Midwest will offer a FDA-approved <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-improving-cervical-cancer-screening-with-hpv-self-collection-tests/">self-collection HPV test</a> to help reduce barriers to screening. This service will later expand to Mayo Clinic in Arizona and Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Name super/CG: Kathy MacLaughlin, M.D./Family Medicine/Mayo Clinic.</strong></p>



<p>For women ages 21–65, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Screening for cervical cancer every three years with cervical cytology alone in women aged 21 to 29 years.</li>



<li>For women aged 30 to 65, screening every three years with cervical cytology alone, every five years with high-risk HPV (hrHPV) testing alone, or every five years with hrHPV testing combined with cytology (co-testing).<br></li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says the current guidelines suggest that after age 65, if you've had past negative/normal screening, particularly important in the prior 10 years, it's OK for most people to stop screening, but that might not always be the case.</p>



<p>"People who have previously had precancers (CIN-2 or CIN-3) treated with a procedure called LEEP (loop electrosurgical excision procedure) should not stop screening. If someone is immunocompromised or has had cervical cancer, they should not stop screening. Or if they've had in utero DES (diethylstilbestrol) exposure, they should not stop screening. To exit screening after age 65, there should be none of those risk factors. And then you also need 10 years of either three negative Paps or two negative HPV tests to say, yes, you are done," she says.</p>



<p>If you're unsure if you should be screened, consult your healthcare team to determine what's best for you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk and prevention for cervical cancer</h2>



<p>"Persistent high-risk human papillomavirus infection, or HPV, is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers. Anyone with a cervix who is sexually active is at risk, particularly if they haven't had the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-protecting-kids-from-cancer-with-hpv-vaccine/">HPV vaccine series</a>," says Dr. MacLaughlin.</p>

<li>Smoking tobacco</li>



<li>Lack of screening</li>



<li>Multiple sexual partners</li>
</ul>



<p>Preventing cervical cancer involves three steps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HPV vaccination is most effective if given to preteens/teens (females and males), but it is routinely recommended for all 9-26-year-olds and available through a shared decision-making discussion with your clinician for 27-45-year-olds (females and males).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Get screened at recommended intervals.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Appropriate management of abnormal screening results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What happens with your HPV self-collection results?</h2>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says about 85%-90% of people will test negative or not have HPV. They will be advised to have repeat testing in three years — though that could change with future guideline updates to five-year interval screening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for those with positive HPV test results, further testing will be needed.&nbsp;<br><br>Different types of high-risk HPV are being screened for, she says.</p>



<p>"HPV 16 and HPV 18 are the highest of the high risk. They cause 70% of cervical cancers. If either of those is found on the HPV self-collection test, the patient will need a referral to colposcopy, which is an outpatient procedure where the cervix is looked at under a microscope," says Dr. MacLaughlin. "Some small biopsies might be taken from the cervical tissue to ensure that there's not precancer."</p>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin explains that if other types of HPV are found on the self-collection test (not HPV 16, not HPV 18), the patient will need to return to the clinic for a Pap test to complete their cervical cancer screening, as that information is necessary to guide the next steps. She says there is a difference from a clinician-collected cervical sample for HPV testing because the lab can add a Pap test to the sample of cervical cells but cannot run a Pap test on vaginal samples. This is expected to happen about 10% of the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force is updating its&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/document/draft-evidence-review/cervical-cancer-screening-adults-adolescents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recommendations</a>. In its draft recommendation statement, it endorses the HPV self-collection option for people aged 30 to 65.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maclaughlin-kathy-l-m-d/bio-20054774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kathy MacLaughlin</a>, a Mayo Clinic family physician specializing in cervical cancer prevention, says&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-cervical-cancer-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>&nbsp;for HPV is important, but there are barriers for some patients to screening tests that require a speculum exam — and that leads to lower screening rates in those populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new option will be offered soon to help with these healthcare disparities. Mayo Clinic is one of a few medical organizations in the U.S. that will provide eligible patients with the option of an FDA-approved self-collection HPV test. The alternative screening is expected to become available at Mayo Clinic practices in the Midwest beginning February 5 and then later expand to Mayo Clinic in Arizona and Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traditional cancer screening involves a clinician-collected cervical sample for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap</a>&nbsp;and/or HPV test. A new option will hopefully get more people screened.</p>



<p>"We're calling it the HPV self-collection test. The difference is that instead of your clinician putting in a speculum and doing a swab of the cervix, the patient would use a self-collection device to get a vaginal sample to test for HPV," says Dr. MacLaughlin.</p>



<p></p>

<p>The HPV self-collection test is done in a healthcare setting</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>She says the test is quick and painless. It's aimed at people facing barriers to having a speculum exam. For example, those with disabilities, mobility issues, cultural or religious reasons, or a history of trauma. The test is done privately in a healthcare setting, such as an exam room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the self-collection test works</h2>



<p>"The device is inserted, just like a tampon into the vagina, and the little plastic wings on the side of the device control the insertion depth, so people don't have to worry about pushing it in too far. And then they would take the plunger and push that in, and that extends the sampling brush. This is a very soft, dry bristle brush. And then the handle needs to be rotated five times, and it clicks. You can hear the click. You can feel the clicks, so you know you've done enough turns. Once that has been done, the patient would remove the entire device and just retract the brush and cap it, and this will get sent to the lab for the testing," Dr. MacLaughlin explains.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team to determine which test is best for you. The most important thing is to get screened.<br><br>"The beauty of screening is that we're catching things before it is cancer, when it's still treatable as a precancer," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says that, for now, the self-collection screening must be done in a healthcare setting and is not for at-home use. However, this is anticipated to change in upcoming years, and eventually, home-based self-collection should be approved.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Script-MCM-What-to-know-about-MRI-for-dense-breasts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong></p>



<p>"The first thing to know if you get notified is that dense breast tissue is completely normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of all women will have dense tissue," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>He says dense breasts are identified through a mammogram. Additional testing is the next step.</p>



<p>"The most widely available supplemental screening test for women with dense tissues is probably an ultrasound of the breast or an MRI," says Dr. Sharpe. "There have been lots of studies showing that MRI is the most sensitive test for finding breast cancer."</p>



<p>An MRI is meant to be used along with a mammogram, not instead.</p>



<p>"MRI is the most sensitive test we have for finding breast cancer. It can see through density. It can find hard-to-see, small cancers," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>But it's not for everyone. You'll lie face down on a table and then guided into the MRI machine."Some patients that have challenges with claustrophobia might struggle to be comfortable in the smaller space&nbsp;of the MRI scanner," explains Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Dr. Richard Sharpe looks at breast images from MRI screening" class="wp-image-396103" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Richard Sharpe examines MRI breast screening images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The benefit is clear, he says.</p>



<p>"Women with dense tissue or high risk for breast cancer that undergo breast MRI, we are able to see cancers that would be hiding from the mammogram."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supplemental screening options</h2>



<p>Other supplemental screening options include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging (MBI)</a>, ultrasound and contrast-enhanced mammography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Sharpe says choosing what screening method works for you is an individual decision that should be made with your healthcare team, but he says it's important to start with your annual screening.</p>



<p>"The most important thing for women to know is that you should get your annual mammogram, starting at age 40. Also, if you have dense tissue, consider a supplemental screening, another imaging test looking at the breast tissues in a different way — and you should get that exam regularly as well," he says.</p>

<p>It may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it is reality. Mayo Clinic researchers are developing personalized lung cancer vaccines.</p>



<p>"We actually make a vaccine that's specific for each individual's cancers," says Dr. Knutson.</p>

<p>The process involves analyzing cancer cells to create a one-of-a-kind vaccine.</p>



<p>"We can take a small part of that cancer and sequence that cancer and get the information that we need to design the vaccine," he explains.</p>



<p>The vaccine uses the immune system to identify and combat cancer.</p>



<p>"We can use that vaccine to hopefully prevent the disease from coming back, or we can use it to help shrink a tumor when given with other types of therapies," Dr. Knutson says.</p>



<p>You can reduce your risk of lung cancer by quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why supplemental breast screening is recommended</h2>



<p>"Breast density is important for really two separate reasons. One, the dense tissue on a mammogram looks white, and cancer looks white, so you can imagine if we're trying to find a small breast cancer in a sea of white breast tissue, it can be very difficult," says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p>And second, those with dense breasts have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>"For those reasons, we encourage women who have dense breast tissue to consider supplemental screening," says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p>One screening you may hear about is MBI, a test developed by the Mayo Clinic. It's done in addition to a mammogram. It uses a radioactive tracer that can identify cancer cells.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="450" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/mss_0001420215_Fotor-16x9-1.jpg" alt="a young woman preparing to have molecular breast imaging MBI screening for breast cancer" class="wp-image-218359" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/mss_0001420215_Fotor-16x9-1.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/mss_0001420215_Fotor-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/mss_0001420215_Fotor-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure></div>


<p>"And since breast cancer is growing quickly, it's recruiting blood flow, it has more energy than the surrounding breast tissue, it will uptake that radiotracer more so than the normal tissue," she explains.</p>



<p>And by doing so, it lights up and becomes clearer to see for a radiologist compared to the normal surrounding tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out if MBI or other screening options are best for you, talk with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>"If you have dense breast tissue, really consider supplemental screening because we know that detects a significant number more breast cancers than mammograms alone," Dr. Robinson says.</p>

<p><em>Findings will help identify patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer who may benefit from targeted therapies </em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Findings from a multi-institutional, international study led by researchers from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> have significantly advanced the understanding of genetic alterations in the BRCA2 gene, a key player in hereditary cancer risk. The researchers completed a comprehensive functional assessment of all possible variants within the crucial DNA-binding domain of BRCA2, resulting in the clinical classification of 91% of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in this part of the gene. This finding dramatically improves the accuracy of genetic testing and will allow healthcare professionals to offer more precise risk assessments and personalized treatment plans for people carrying these variants.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to analyze the functional impact of almost 7,000 BRCA2 variants, definitively identifying those that increase cancer risk and those that do not. This new information will eliminate much of the uncertainty surrounding VUS, allowing for more informed decisions regarding cancer screening, preventive measures and treatment strategies.</p>

<p>"This research is a major advancement in understanding the role of many BRCA2 variants in cancer predisposition," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professor of Medical Research at Mayo Clinic. "Until now, patients who carried VUS often worried if they would develop cancer, but now with the classification of these variants, we can provide a clearer picture of cancer risk and tailor both prevention strategies as well as breast cancer treatment accordingly."</p>



<p>The findings have immediate implications for genetic testing laboratories and healthcare professionals, aiding them in offering more precise and personalized care to patients with VUS. Many people with VUS may be notified about the reclassification of their VUS as the ClinVar BRCA1/2 expert panel and testing laboratories use the new information in testing reports and updates.&nbsp; In addition, this new insight will aid in identifying patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast, ovarian</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355427#:~:text=The%20connection%20between%20breast%20cancer%20and%20pancreatic%20cancer,to%20see%20if%20there%20is%20a%20mutation%20present." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> who might benefit from targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>&nbsp;"We now have a catalog of every possible VUS in this part of BRCA2 that can be used to guide clinical care," says Dr. Couch.</p>



<p>The researchers say that this research lays the groundwork for future studies characterizing and classifying all BRCA2 variants across diverse populations and cancer types, improving risk assessment for everyone.</p>



<p>The study involved collaborators at Ambry Genetics Inc., Duke University, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania and several contributing studies from the CARRIERS consortium. The study was supported by funding from the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer SPORE (P50 CA116201) and R35 Outstanding Investigator Programs, the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers spent 2024 mining patient data, leveraging artificial intelligence and conducting clinical trials to reveal insights that improve patient care.</h3>



<p><em>By Mayo Clinic staff</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center physicians and scientists are researching the causes of cancer and its recurrence, innovating new methods to detect cancer as early as possible, and developing new and more effective treatments. Here are some of their top success stories from the past year:</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/25/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New study finds triple-negative breast cancer tumors with an increase in immune cells have lower risk of recurrence after surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>A multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044575#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20cancer%20recurrence,cells%20from%20your%20cancer%20remained." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a>&nbsp;and better survival rates — even without chemotherapy treatment. The&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;was published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>The immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&nbsp;tumor and&nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&nbsp;</a>and first author of the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/30/mayo-researchers-invented-a-new-class-of-ai-to-improve-cancer-research-and-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo researchers invented a new class of AI to improve cancer research and treatments</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers recently invented a new class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms called hypothesis-driven AI, which is a significant departure from traditional AI models that learn solely from data. In a review published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38398213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>, the researchers note that this emerging class of AI offers an innovative way to use massive datasets to help discover the complex causes of diseases such as cancer and improve treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"This fosters a new era in designing targeted and informed AI algorithms to solve scientific questions, better understand diseases, and guide individualized medicine," says senior author and co-inventor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/li-hu-ph-d/bio-20035057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hu Li, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Systems biology and AI researcher in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. "It has the potential to uncover insights missed by conventional AI."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/06/11/melanoma-in-darker-skin-tones-race-and-sex-play-a-role-mayo-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Melanoma in darker skin tones: Race and sex play a role, Mayo study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>Melanoma is often detected later in people with darker skin complexions, and the consequences can be devastating, a Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;reveals. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">melanoma</a>&nbsp;may be found less frequently in people with darker complexions than fair ones, this serious form of cancer can affect anyone. The study consisted of 492,597 patients with melanoma. Findings suggests that added vigilance in early screening is particularly needed for Black men, whose cancers are often found at later stages, leading to worse outcomes compared to white patients.</p>



<p>"We compared non-Hispanic Black patients to white patients and saw striking differences in how patients presented with the disease," says surgical oncologist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study and a researcher at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We saw more extremity melanoma and more later-stage disease."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/07/04/new-research-platform-assesses-brain-cancer-mutations-during-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research platform assesses brain cancer mutations during surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318843121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mayo Clinic researchers report on a new surgical platform used during brain cancer surgery that informs critical decision-making about tumor treatment within minutes. The platform uses mass spectrometry, a sensitive technique used to analyze substances in tissue samples, to identify a key gene mutation in&nbsp;brain cancer in real time.</p>



<p>The researchers say that, in addition to enabling real-time diagnosis, the platform allows surgeons to determine a patient's prognosis and perform tumor resection to improve patient outcomes. In the future, the new platform will help surgeons tailor treatment to the molecular features of a tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/14/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo Clinic study uncovers genetic cancer risks in 550 patients</strong></a></p>



<p>Current screening protocols fail to catch a notable number of people carrying genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome, which increase the risk of developing certain cancers. This issue is particularly pronounced among underrepresented minorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These&nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.24.00106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, published in JCO Precision Oncology, are based on genetic screenings of more than 44,000 study participants from diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the exomes, the protein-coding regions of genes where most disease-causing mutations are found. They identified 550 people (1.24% of participants) as carriers of the hereditary mutations.&nbsp;Importantly, half of these people were previously unaware of their hereditary genetic risk, and 40% did not meet existing clinical guidelines for genetic testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/20/new-research-discovers-a-new-combination-of-therapy-for-people-with-a-type-of-leukemia-leading-them-to-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research discovers a new combination of therapy for people with a type of leukemia, leading them to live longer</strong></a></p>



<p>In a new multicenter, international study led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, researchers found that people with the B-cell precursor subtype of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (BCP-ALL), who also lacked a genetic abnormality known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/multimedia/how-the-philadelphia-chromosome-forms/img-20007421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia chromosome</a>&nbsp;and were in remission with no trace of cancer, showed significantly higher survival rates when blinatumomab was added to their chemotherapy treatment. The randomized study results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>



<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center hematologist. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/27/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Detecting pancreatic cancer through changes in body composition and metabolism</strong></a></p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, research findings from Mayo Clinic represent a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that could help in early detection.</p>



<p>Researchers examined medical records of patients with a common type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">pancre</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">tic cancer</a> known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms, the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in various physiological and metabolic measurements. The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in early detection.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/11/05/radiopharmaceutical-therapy-shows-favorable-results-for-people-with-tough-to-treat-meningioma-brain-tumors-mayo-clinic-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Radiopharmaceutical therapy shows favorable results for people with tough-to-treat meningioma brain tumors, Mayo Clinic study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>A radiopharmaceutical therapy that has successfully extended progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors shows early signs of delivering similar benefits to patients with difficult-to-treat&nbsp;meningioma, a type of brain tumor. The nonrandomized phase 2 study's findings were presented at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've found a therapy with a meaningful signal for effectiveness and safety for people with refractory meningioma, a condition with no standard treatment options," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Merrell, M.D.</a>, lead researcher of the trial and a radiation oncologist at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic&nbsp;announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may improve overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed&nbsp;glioblastoma&nbsp;while maintaining their quality of life. The phase 2, single-arm study results are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months, and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. "As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-treatment-could-delay-cancer-progression-in-patients-with-high-risk-smoldering-multiple-myeloma/"><strong>Research shows new treatment could delay cancer progression in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma</strong></a></p>



<p>A new treatment is showing promise for people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). This precancerous condition can progress to active&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer. High-risk SMM carries a higher likelihood of progression.</p>



<p>Results from a phase 3 clinical trial, published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a>&nbsp;and presented at the <a href="https://www.hematology.org/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Hematology meeting</a>, demonstrated that daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells, significantly reduces the risk of progression to active multiple myeloma and improves overall survival compared to active monitoring.</p>



<p>"These results are a major advancement in the treatment of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. Vincent Rajkumar, M.D.</a>, hematologist,&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&nbsp;and lead investigator of the trial. "For the first time, we have a treatment option that can significantly delay or prevent the progression to active disease, improving patients' lives and offering them a chance at a longer, healthier future."</p>
