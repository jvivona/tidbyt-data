<p--><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/toolkit-for-reducing-cervical-cancer-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;is almost always caused by persistent high-risk HPV, particularly HPV 16 and HPV 18, which account for about 70% of cases.&nbsp;<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maclaughlin-kathy-l-m-d/bio-20054774" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Kathy MacLaughlin</a>, a Mayo Clinic family physician specializing in cervical cancer prevention, says&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-cervical-cancer-screening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screening</a>&nbsp;for HPV is important, but there are barriers for some patients to screening tests that require a speculum exam — and that leads to lower screening rates in those populations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new option will be offered soon to help with these healthcare disparities. Mayo Clinic is one of a few medical organizations in the U.S. that will provide eligible patients with the option of an FDA-approved self-collection HPV test. The alternative screening will begin soon in Mayo Clinic practices in the Midwest and then expand to Mayo Clinic in Arizona and Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Traditional cancer screening involves a clinician-collected cervical sample for a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap</a>&nbsp;and/or HPV test. A new option will hopefully get more people screened.</p>



<p>"We're calling it the HPV self-collection test. The difference is that instead of your clinician putting in a speculum and doing a swab of the cervix, the patient would use a self-collection device to get a vaginal sample to test for HPV," says Dr. MacLaughlin.</p>



<p></p>

<p>The HPV self-collection test is done in a healthcare setting</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>She says the test is quick and painless. It's aimed at people facing barriers to having a speculum exam. For example, those with disabilities, mobility issues, cultural or religious reasons, or a history of trauma. The test is done privately in a healthcare setting, such as an exam room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How the self-collection test works</h2>



<p>"The device is inserted, just like a tampon into the vagina, and the little plastic wings on the side of the device control the insertion depth, so people don't have to worry about pushing it in too far. And then they would take the plunger and push that in, and that extends the sampling brush. This is a very soft, dry bristle brush. And then the handle needs to be rotated five times, and it clicks. You can hear the click. You can feel the clicks, so you know you've done enough turns. Once that has been done, the patient would remove the entire device and just retract the brush and cap it, and this will get sent to the lab for the testing," Dr. MacLaughlin explains.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team to determine which test is best for you. The most important thing is to get screened.<br><br>"The beauty of screening is that we're catching things before it is cancer, when it's still treatable as a precancer," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. MacLaughlin says that, for now, the self-collection screening must be done in a healthcare setting and is not for at-home use. However, this is anticipated to change in upcoming years, and eventually, home-based self-collection should be approved.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Script-MCM-What-to-know-about-MRI-for-dense-breasts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong></p>



<p>"The first thing to know if you get notified is that dense breast tissue is completely normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of all women will have dense tissue," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>He says dense breasts are identified through a mammogram. Additional testing is the next step.</p>



<p>"The most widely available supplemental screening test for women with dense tissues is probably an ultrasound of the breast or an MRI," says Dr. Sharpe. "There have been lots of studies showing that MRI is the most sensitive test for finding breast cancer."</p>



<p>An MRI is meant to be used along with a mammogram, not instead.</p>



<p>"MRI is the most sensitive test we have for finding breast cancer. It can see through density. It can find hard-to-see, small cancers," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>But it's not for everyone. You'll lie face down on a table and then guided into the MRI machine."Some patients that have challenges with claustrophobia might struggle to be comfortable in the smaller space&nbsp;of the MRI scanner," explains Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Dr. Richard Sharpe looks at breast images from MRI screening" class="wp-image-396103" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Breat-MRI-2-16-x-9.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Richard Sharpe examines MRI breast screening images</figcaption></figure>



<p>The benefit is clear, he says.</p>



<p>"Women with dense tissue or high risk for breast cancer that undergo breast MRI, we are able to see cancers that would be hiding from the mammogram."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supplemental screening options</h2>



<p>Other supplemental screening options include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging (MBI)</a>, ultrasound and contrast-enhanced mammography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Sharpe says choosing what screening method works for you is an individual decision that should be made with your healthcare team, but he says it's important to start with your annual screening.</p>



<p>"The most important thing for women to know is that you should get your annual mammogram, starting at age 40. Also, if you have dense tissue, consider a supplemental screening, another imaging test looking at the breast tissues in a different way — and you should get that exam regularly as well," he says.</p>

<p>The process involves analyzing cancer cells to create a one-of-a-kind vaccine.</p>



<p>"We can take a small part of that cancer and sequence that cancer and get the information that we need to design the vaccine," he explains.</p>



<p>The vaccine uses the immune system to identify and combat cancer.</p>



<p>"We can use that vaccine to hopefully prevent the disease from coming back, or we can use it to help shrink a tumor when given with other types of therapies," Dr. Knutson says.</p>



<p>You can reduce your risk of lung cancer by quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why supplemental breast screening is recommended</h2>



<p>"Breast density is important for really two separate reasons. One, the dense tissue on a mammogram looks white, and cancer looks white, so you can imagine if we're trying to find a small breast cancer in a sea of white breast tissue, it can be very difficult," says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p>And second, those with dense breasts have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer.</p>



<p>"For those reasons, we encourage women who have dense breast tissue to consider supplemental screening," says Dr. Robinson.</p>



<p>One screening you may hear about is MBI, a test developed by the Mayo Clinic. It's done in addition to a mammogram. It uses a radioactive tracer that can identify cancer cells.</p>

<p>"And since breast cancer is growing quickly, it's recruiting blood flow, it has more energy than the surrounding breast tissue, it will uptake that radiotracer more so than the normal tissue," she explains.</p>



<p>And by doing so, it lights up and becomes clearer to see for a radiologist compared to the normal surrounding tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To find out if MBI or other screening options are best for you, talk with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>"If you have dense breast tissue, really consider supplemental screening because we know that detects a significant number more breast cancers than mammograms alone," Dr. Robinson says.</p>

<p><em>Findings will help identify patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer who may benefit from targeted therapies </em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Findings from a multi-institutional, international study led by researchers from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> have significantly advanced the understanding of genetic alterations in the BRCA2 gene, a key player in hereditary cancer risk. The researchers completed a comprehensive functional assessment of all possible variants within the crucial DNA-binding domain of BRCA2, resulting in the clinical classification of 91% of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in this part of the gene. This finding dramatically improves the accuracy of genetic testing and will allow healthcare professionals to offer more precise risk assessments and personalized treatment plans for people carrying these variants.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to analyze the functional impact of almost 7,000 BRCA2 variants, definitively identifying those that increase cancer risk and those that do not. This new information will eliminate much of the uncertainty surrounding VUS, allowing for more informed decisions regarding cancer screening, preventive measures and treatment strategies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906-240x300.jpg" alt="Dr. Fergus Couch" class="wp-image-398743" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This research is a major advancement in understanding the role of many BRCA2 variants in cancer predisposition," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professor of Medical Research at Mayo Clinic. "Until now, patients who carried VUS often worried if they would develop cancer, but now with the classification of these variants, we can provide a clearer picture of cancer risk and tailor both prevention strategies as well as breast cancer treatment accordingly."</p>



<p>The findings have immediate implications for genetic testing laboratories and healthcare professionals, aiding them in offering more precise and personalized care to patients with VUS. Many people with VUS may be notified about the reclassification of their VUS as the ClinVar BRCA1/2 expert panel and testing laboratories use the new information in testing reports and updates.&nbsp; In addition, this new insight will aid in identifying patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast, ovarian</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355427#:~:text=The%20connection%20between%20breast%20cancer%20and%20pancreatic%20cancer,to%20see%20if%20there%20is%20a%20mutation%20present." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> who might benefit from targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>&nbsp;"We now have a catalog of every possible VUS in this part of BRCA2 that can be used to guide clinical care," says Dr. Couch.</p>



<p>The researchers say that this research lays the groundwork for future studies characterizing and classifying all BRCA2 variants across diverse populations and cancer types, improving risk assessment for everyone.</p>



<p>The study involved collaborators at Ambry Genetics Inc., Duke University, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania and several contributing studies from the CARRIERS consortium. The study was supported by funding from the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer SPORE (P50 CA116201) and R35 Outstanding Investigator Programs, the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers spent 2024 mining patient data, leveraging artificial intelligence and conducting clinical trials to reveal insights that improve patient care.</h3>



<p><em>By Mayo Clinic staff</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center physicians and scientists are researching the causes of cancer and its recurrence, innovating new methods to detect cancer as early as possible, and developing new and more effective treatments. Here are some of their top success stories from the past year:</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/25/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New study finds triple-negative breast cancer tumors with an increase in immune cells have lower risk of recurrence after surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>A multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044575#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20cancer%20recurrence,cells%20from%20your%20cancer%20remained." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a>&nbsp;and better survival rates — even without chemotherapy treatment. The&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;was published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>The immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&nbsp;tumor and&nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&nbsp;</a>and first author of the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/30/mayo-researchers-invented-a-new-class-of-ai-to-improve-cancer-research-and-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo researchers invented a new class of AI to improve cancer research and treatments</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers recently invented a new class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms called hypothesis-driven AI, which is a significant departure from traditional AI models that learn solely from data. In a review published in&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38398213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>, the researchers note that this emerging class of AI offers an innovative way to use massive datasets to help discover the complex causes of diseases such as cancer and improve treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"This fosters a new era in designing targeted and informed AI algorithms to solve scientific questions, better understand diseases, and guide individualized medicine," says senior author and co-inventor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/li-hu-ph-d/bio-20035057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hu Li, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Systems biology and AI researcher in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. "It has the potential to uncover insights missed by conventional AI."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/06/11/melanoma-in-darker-skin-tones-race-and-sex-play-a-role-mayo-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Melanoma in darker skin tones: Race and sex play a role, Mayo study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>Melanoma is often detected later in people with darker skin complexions, and the consequences can be devastating, a Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;reveals. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">melanoma</a>&nbsp;may be found less frequently in people with darker complexions than fair ones, this serious form of cancer can affect anyone. The study consisted of 492,597 patients with melanoma. Findings suggests that added vigilance in early screening is particularly needed for Black men, whose cancers are often found at later stages, leading to worse outcomes compared to white patients.</p>



<p>"We compared non-Hispanic Black patients to white patients and saw striking differences in how patients presented with the disease," says surgical oncologist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study and a researcher at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We saw more extremity melanoma and more later-stage disease."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/07/04/new-research-platform-assesses-brain-cancer-mutations-during-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research platform assesses brain cancer mutations during surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318843121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mayo Clinic researchers report on a new surgical platform used during brain cancer surgery that informs critical decision-making about tumor treatment within minutes. The platform uses mass spectrometry, a sensitive technique used to analyze substances in tissue samples, to identify a key gene mutation in&nbsp;brain cancer in real time.</p>



<p>The researchers say that, in addition to enabling real-time diagnosis, the platform allows surgeons to determine a patient's prognosis and perform tumor resection to improve patient outcomes. In the future, the new platform will help surgeons tailor treatment to the molecular features of a tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/14/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo Clinic study uncovers genetic cancer risks in 550 patients</strong></a></p>



<p>Current screening protocols fail to catch a notable number of people carrying genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome, which increase the risk of developing certain cancers. This issue is particularly pronounced among underrepresented minorities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These&nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.24.00106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, published in JCO Precision Oncology, are based on genetic screenings of more than 44,000 study participants from diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the exomes, the protein-coding regions of genes where most disease-causing mutations are found. They identified 550 people (1.24% of participants) as carriers of the hereditary mutations.&nbsp;Importantly, half of these people were previously unaware of their hereditary genetic risk, and 40% did not meet existing clinical guidelines for genetic testing.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/20/new-research-discovers-a-new-combination-of-therapy-for-people-with-a-type-of-leukemia-leading-them-to-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research discovers a new combination of therapy for people with a type of leukemia, leading them to live longer</strong></a></p>



<p>In a new multicenter, international study led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, researchers found that people with the B-cell precursor subtype of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (BCP-ALL), who also lacked a genetic abnormality known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/multimedia/how-the-philadelphia-chromosome-forms/img-20007421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia chromosome</a>&nbsp;and were in remission with no trace of cancer, showed significantly higher survival rates when blinatumomab was added to their chemotherapy treatment. The randomized study results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>



<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center hematologist. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/27/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Detecting pancreatic cancer through changes in body composition and metabolism</strong></a></p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, research findings from Mayo Clinic represent a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that could help in early detection.</p>



<p>Researchers examined medical records of patients with a common type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">pancre</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">tic cancer</a> known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms, the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in various physiological and metabolic measurements. The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in early detection.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/11/05/radiopharmaceutical-therapy-shows-favorable-results-for-people-with-tough-to-treat-meningioma-brain-tumors-mayo-clinic-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Radiopharmaceutical therapy shows favorable results for people with tough-to-treat meningioma brain tumors, Mayo Clinic study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>A radiopharmaceutical therapy that has successfully extended progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors shows early signs of delivering similar benefits to patients with difficult-to-treat&nbsp;meningioma, a type of brain tumor. The nonrandomized phase 2 study's findings were presented at the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've found a therapy with a meaningful signal for effectiveness and safety for people with refractory meningioma, a condition with no standard treatment options," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Merrell, M.D.</a>, lead researcher of the trial and a radiation oncologist at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/breakthrough-in-treatment-approach-showing-promise-in-the-fight-against-glioblastoma-the-deadliest-and-most-aggressive-type-of-brain-cancer/"><strong>Breakthrough in treatment approach showing promise in the fight against glioblastoma, the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic&nbsp;announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may improve overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed&nbsp;glioblastoma&nbsp;while maintaining their quality of life. The phase 2, single-arm study results are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months, and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. "As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-treatment-could-delay-cancer-progression-in-patients-with-high-risk-smoldering-multiple-myeloma/"><strong>Research shows new treatment could delay cancer progression in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma</strong></a></p>



<p>A new treatment is showing promise for people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). This precancerous condition can progress to active&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer. High-risk SMM carries a higher likelihood of progression.</p>



<p>Results from a phase 3 clinical trial, published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a>&nbsp;and presented at the <a href="https://www.hematology.org/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Hematology meeting</a>, demonstrated that daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells, significantly reduces the risk of progression to active multiple myeloma and improves overall survival compared to active monitoring.</p>



<p>"These results are a major advancement in the treatment of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. Vincent Rajkumar, M.D.</a>, hematologist,&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&nbsp;and lead investigator of the trial. "For the first time, we have a treatment option that can significantly delay or prevent the progression to active disease, improving patients' lives and offering them a chance at a longer, healthier future."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>



<p>"We think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disease research. We hope to save time and resources and avoid the development of therapies that fail upon translation into patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, who leads the Translational Neuroimmunology Lab.&nbsp;"Understanding which treatments show potential for success in human organoids could dramatically accelerate the rate of new therapies for patients with unmet needs."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My brother had lingering hoarseness and a sore throat. When he finally went to the doctor, he was diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tonsil-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20367939">tonsil cancer</a>. He's in treatment, but it's been tough. Chemo makes him sick, and radiation is doing a number on his throat and salivary glands, making it hard to eat. He's on a feeding tube, but he has lost a lot of weight and is fatigued. I'm worried about him. I never heard of tonsil cancer before this. I'd like to help spread awareness.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Dealing with a life-threatening illness — for yourself or a loved one — can be devastating.&nbsp;It can help to learn more. Spreading awareness and learning about prevention are so important.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tonsil cancer is a type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171">head and neck cancer</a>. Head and neck cancers include cancers of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tongue-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20378428">tongue</a>; the back of the tongue, which you can't see when you look in the mirror; the tonsils; or the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462">throat</a>, which includes several body parts, such as the larynx or voice box. We also see other rare cancers, including salivary gland cancers and cancers in the sinuses and nose.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tonsils, located on the left and right sides of the back of the throat, are part of the immune system, a complex network that protects the body against infection. Tonsils are part of the lymphatic system and have lymphoid tissue. That's why they can look lumpy and bumpy. They're filled with immune cells. That same lymphoid tissue is on the surface of the back of the tongue. Cancers that arise in the tonsil or back of the tongue are classified as oropharyngeal cancer, and most of these (approximately 70%) are caused by HPV.</p>



<p>Head and neck cancers, especially those caused by HPV, are more common in men. The most common way in which HPV head and neck cancers are found is from it spreading into the lymph nodes in the neck. The story we often hear is, "I was shaving, and I felt a lump in my neck." Most of the time patients don't have a lot of other symptoms. They may notice discomfort when they're swallowing or a sensation that there's something in their throat that doesn't feel right.</p>



<p>HPV is a virus that almost everybody will get exposed to in their lifetime. The primary mode of transmission is sexual. Most people get exposed in their teenage years or early 20s. The virus typically doesn't cause any symptoms, and there is no treatment. Fortunately, most people's immune system will clear the virus from the body after exposure. However, in approximately 10% of people, the virus is not cleared, and they become chronic carriers of HPV and at risk for cancer development decades later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HPV-associated cancers typically respond better to treatments. They tend to have a higher cure rate. We often treat HPV cancers differently than how we treat some non-HPV cancers, which are largely related to smoking and alcohol use. But we do actually see non-HPV cancers in nonsmokers as well.</p>



<p>When somebody is diagnosed with a type of head and neck cancer, we do a lot of testing to see if the cancer has spread into lymph nodes or other parts of the body. That helps us determine treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If the cancer has not spread, treatment is individualized based on the patient's needs, and it typically includes a combination of surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. But if a patient's cancer has spread to another organ, chemotherapy and immunotherapy delivered throughout the body via the bloodstream are typical treatments.</p>



<p>In 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved immunotherapy to treat advanced head and neck cancer.&nbsp;What's promising for the future is the next generation of immunotherapy that aims to further engage the immune system. Research is ongoing into therapeutic vaccines that try to get the body's immune system to recognize and then fight the cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prevention, of course, is always better than treatment. While we cure most people with head and neck cancer, no cancer treatment is without long-term side effects and impact on life. While the HPV vaccine cannot prevent all cancers, it is considered a helpful measure in HPV prevention</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/in-depth/hpv-vaccine/art-20047292">HPV vaccine</a>&nbsp;has been available since 2006 in the U.S. It's FDA-approved for males and females ages 9 to 45. For cancer prevention, we know from studies that earlier is better, before sexual activity begins, but we also know there's still benefit over time, even up to age 45.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to vaccinating yourself and your loved ones against the HPV virus, other tips to prevent head and neck cancers include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/quit-smoking/basics/quitsmoking-basics/hlv-20049487">Stop smoking</a>&nbsp;or using tobacco products. Better yet, don't start.</li>



<li>Drink alcohol sparingly, if at all.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Consider healthy behaviors, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389">physical activity</a>&nbsp;and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/10-great-health-foods/art-20546837">plant-based diet</a>&nbsp;with more fruits and vegetables.&nbsp;</li>

<p>Pancreatic cancer screening has advanced significantly in recent years. There are now research-based guidelines on screening for people at high risk of developing the disease, and researchers are collaborating to develop new screening approaches involving genetic testing and artificial intelligence (AI).</p>



<p>"We have high-quality studies from the U.S. and Europe that show screening can detect cancer at an earlier stage and that detection leads to better overall outcomes — most notably, improved survival," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wallace-michael-b-m-d/bio-20569473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Wallace, M.D.</a>, an interventional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/advanced-endoscopy-center-florida/overview/ovc-20523888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endoscopist</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>



<p>Here's what you need to know about pancreatic cancer screening:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who should be screened for pancreatic cancer?</h2>



<p>Guidelines recommend screening for people at high risk of pancreatic cancer — those with a family history of the disease or known genetic mutations.</p>



<p>People with a family history of pancreatic cancer have the highest risk of developing the disease. "The more relatives you have with pancreatic cancer, the greater your risk. Our threshold to recommend screening is two first-degree relatives (mother, father or siblings) or three relatives of any degree with pancreatic cancer," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>It's also possible to have genetic mutations or changes that put you at high risk of pancreatic cancer, but Dr. Wallace says few people receive the genetic testing needed to identify those mutations. "Less than one-third of people who are eligible get genetic testing," he says. "It can be a lifesaving procedure that is available and covered by health insurance."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6120785/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;has also shown that a new diagnosis of diabetes accompanied by weight loss can be one of the earliest indicators of pancreatic cancer. "This is different than the more common form of diabetes that is associated with obesity and weight gain. This is diabetes associated with weight loss, particularly in people over the age of 50. Those individuals should speak with their doctor and consider having an evaluation to look at their pancreas, such as imaging or blood tests," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How is pancreatic cancer screening conducted?</h2>



<p>Dr. Wallace says two screening tests are recommended for pancreatic cancer:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>&nbsp;and endoscopic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultrasound</a>.</p>



<p>"Screening should be done in a center that can conduct a high-quality MRI and a procedure called an endoscopic ultrasound," says Dr. Wallace. "That's like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/endoscopy/multimedia/endoscopy/img-20007299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endoscopy</a>&nbsp;we do for heartburn or stomach pain, but the endoscope has an ultrasound device on the end of it."</p>



<p>Because the pancreas sits just behind the stomach, an endoscopic ultrasound allows your doctor to get a precise view of the pancreas. If an area looks concerning, they can use the endoscope to get a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">biopsy</a>.</p>



<p>Screening is generally recommended once a year. "In many cases, we alternate tests — an MRI one year and an endoscopic ultrasound the next year," says Dr. Wallace. He stresses the importance of getting screening from an experienced pancreatic cancer care professional. "Both tests are somewhat user dependent. That means the people performing the tests should be highly experienced in looking at the pancreas — professionals at a large academic medical center (one that educates healthcare professionals) that see lots of patients with pancreatic disease and pancreatic cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the latest research advances in pancreatic cancer screening?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetic testing and screening</h3>



<p>Efforts are underway to increase awareness and use of genetic testing, which is crucial for identifying and screening people at higher risk of pancreatic cancer.</p>



<p>People identified as high risk based on genetic testing make up only about 10% of pancreatic cancer diagnoses. Healthcare professionals often incidentally diagnose the other 90% of pancreatic cancer cases while investigating another issue, such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20375993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cyst</a>. "A cyst is a small fluid collection. Most cysts are benign, but there is a small subset that can turn malignant," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>Dr. Wallace and his colleagues around the world are working to establish screening tests to identify people in the 90% group. One test in development analyzes the fluid in pancreatic cysts to determine the risk of cancer. Another test analyzes pancreas juices for cancer risk.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Artificial intelligence for screening and classifying risk</h3>



<p>Dr. Wallace says about 40% of people over the age of 50 have some type of pancreatic cyst. Understanding their pancreatic cancer risk is a key part of personalizing their screening plans to identify the disease earlier.</p>



<p>Dr. Wallace and his colleagues are nearing the end of a five-year study evaluating an AI algorithm designed to help care teams classify high- and low-risk cysts.&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/an-artificial-intelligence-tool-to-improve-pancreatic-cancer-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preliminary findings published in 2019</a>&nbsp;showed the algorithm could read an MRI scan in half a second, compared to 20 to 30 minutes of manual review by a radiologist.&nbsp;"These advances allow us to tell which of these cysts are likely to turn cancerous, and for those individuals, we can remove the cyst before it becomes malignant and prevent the disease," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>This research, which is expected to conclude in 2025, has the potential to reduce the need for invasive biopsies, enhance screening program accuracy, and improve patient outcomes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Collaborative research and future directions</h3>



<p>In addition to the screening and early identification methods being evaluated at Mayo Clinic, researchers are focused on using indicators such as body weight, blood sugar and cholesterol to predict pancreatic cancer risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Wallace says these indicators might help suggest who could benefit from pancreatic cancer screening. "We're all getting our weight, sugars and cholesterol checked every year. Might there be a signal there that we could use to say you might consider getting screened for pancreatic cancer?"</p>



<p>The integration of genetic testing, AI and innovative screening technologies into preventive care offers the potential to identify pancreatic cancer at earlier, more treatable stages. "We're hoping to implement these advances to monitor patients and alert care professionals of pancreatic cancer risk," says Dr. Wallace. "I really want people to have a sense of hope for pancreatic cancer. We have made important improvements in overall survival and an overall shift towards early detection."</p>
