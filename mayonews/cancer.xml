<p>Minimally invasive surgery uses small incisions and special tools, causing less damage to the body than traditional surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Any minimally invasive approach, whether that's vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic — that's going to be associated with a very fast recovery. The vast majority of the time, patients are able to leave the hospital the same day," explains Dr. Wasson.</p>



<p>The most common gynecologic surgery is hysterectomy — the removal of the uterus.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/hysterectomy.jpg" alt="medical illustration of the various types of hysterectomies" class="wp-image-174317" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/hysterectomy.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/hysterectomy-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>"The vast majority of the time we are able to complete hysterectomy through a minimally invasive approach. The most minimally invasive is a vaginal hysterectomy, which does not require any incisions on the abdomen," she says.</p>



<p>Laparoscopic hysterectomy is another approach.</p>



<p>"We separate the uterus from all of the surrounding tissue, and then we remove it. And then we do still need to do a hysterectomy through a larger incision called a laparotomy, at times. Most commonly that's going to be in the setting of a cancer or if there are extremely large fibroids," says Dr. Wasson.</p>



<p>Dr. Wasson says treatment is not one-size-fits-all, and she encourages patients to ask their healthcare team questions.</p>

<p>Having an open, honest conversation with your healthcare team is important, but some LGBTQ+ people may feel unsafe – and that may lead to delays in seeking care.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to take folks through that initial diagnosis all the way through treatment, symptom control, end-of-life care, palliative care and/or survivorship," says Dr. Cathcart-Rake.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rainbows Cancer Clinic goals</h2>



<p>She says the Rainbows Cancer Clinic has three main goals: to offer a welcoming, affirming space; provide clinical expertise; and conduct research to improve care.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Improving care is critical because cancer outcomes are poorer in this community.</p>



<p>"I don't think we understand exactly why that's the case, and so being able to identify where the issues are and where we can act is super important," Dr. Cathcart-Rake says.</p>



<p>And she offers these words for patients.</p>



<p>"My goal of this clinic is to make sure that I'm advancing your cancer care with a lens toward supporting your identity and your goals."</p>

<p>At 20 years old, Brescia Dover was ready to take on the world. </p>



<p>She was on her way to achieving her dream of being a professional photographer.</p>



<p>Everything was going according to plan when her dream came to a halt. Brescia was diagnosed with cancer. With her plans for her future pushed aside, Brescia's focus was now on her health and hope.</p>



<p>It's an unexpected chapter facing an increasing number of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brescia's dream</strong></h2>



<p>At 4 years old, it was clear Brescia Dover had a flare for creativity. She readily admits she was never one to miss an opportunity to play dress-up, draw pictures, or tell a story.</p>

<p>"Being creative has always been at the core of what I do," she says. Early on she developed a love for photography and videography. Brescia's dream was to pursue a career that allowed her to put her creative energy to work.</p>



<p>After high school Brescia's passion led her to college to study film and media production. She even traveled to Italy to study abroad. After her Italian adventure, Brescia returned to the U.S. to finish college. First, she went to her doctor for her annual checkup.</p>



<p>"I lived a really healthy, balanced lifestyle," says Brescia. "My doctor found swelling on the side of my neck. I hadn't noticed the swelling and didn't have any symptoms." Brescia was sent for an ultrasound followed by a surgical biopsy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The diagnosis - cancer</strong></h2>



<p>The surgical biopsy revealed Brescia had <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-lymphoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hodgkin lymphoma</a>, a rare type of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-new-blood-cancer-treatment-options-with-chimeric-antigen-receptor-t-cell-therapy/">blood cancer</a>. "Being diagnosed with cancer at 20 years old was so scary and I wouldn't wish that on any 20-year-old," says Brescia. "I think about the young version of me who just found out she had cancer, and I just wish I could give her a hug."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-understanding-treating-lymphoma/">Hodgkin lymphoma</a> is a type of cancer that begins in the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-maintain-a-healthy-immune-system/">lymphatic system</a>, which is part of the immune system. Brescia says the news came as a shock because she felt healthy and had no family history of cancer. "It felt like there was something I could have done to prevent it, but I learned that there's nothing I could have done," says Brescia.</p>

<p>"When I was going through college and diagnosed with cancer it was not what I was expecting," says Brescia. "Being a young adult with cancer was very hard and challenging. It is scary and can be very frightening."</p>



<p>At 20 years old, Brescia falls into a group of patients referred to as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adolescents and young adults with cancer</a>. AYA patients are between the ages of 15 and 39. Experts says AYA patients face a distinct set of challenges.</p>



<p>"One of the reasons this age group is so important is based on their life stage; the things they uniquely face, like body image, disruption in school and work, financial challenges, feeling isolation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rosenthal-allison-c-d-o/bio-20178616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Allison Rosenthal</a>, with the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenthal knows firsthand the challenges AYA patients face. She was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/car-t-cell-therapy-restores-hope-for-leukemia-patient/">leukemia</a> during medical school. "I had leukemia in medical school. There were a lot of missed opportunities in my care to recognize the issues that I might face as a 24-year-old woman," explains Dr. Rosenthal.</p>



<p>Putting her experience into action, Dr. Rosenthal championed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Adolescent and Young Adults with Cancer program</a>. The program is tailored to meet the unique needs of AYA patients to include medical care, fertility concerns, social and relationship issues, school and work concerns, and the personal and emotional impact of cancer in this age group.</p>

<p>Brescia underwent about four months of chemotherapy treatment under the care of Dr. Rosenthal. "She did a beautiful job of explaining to me what the process was going to look like and what my treatment plan was going to look like. Because I'm so young, she walked me through the whole process," says Brescia. </p>

<p>After her cancer treatments, Brescia returned to college and got her degree. She the started her own marketing agency providing social media management, videography, photography, and brand development with her personal creative touch. She also celebrated her five-year anniversary of being cancer-free.</p>



<p>"I also have a podcast called the Checkered Jaguar where I get to have incredible conversations with people, share their stories and connect people who may be going through similar challenges that I went through," says Brescia. "We're all in this journey together and just being open and vulnerable with my journey, as challenging as it may be, I feel like it connects me to people all around the world."</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S.</p>



<p>"Our best way of finding a disease at a curable stage is to find it early," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>Patients with a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family history </a>of pancreatic disease are at the greatest risk and should be screened annually with an MRI or an endoscopic ultrasound.</p>



<p>"If we see something abnormal, we can actually take a biopsy directly of it, and that's a very, very safe procedure," he explains.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) also is helping doctors at Mayo Clinic detect the disease earlier.</p>



<p>"We now have very good ways, including some recent advances in artificial intelligence, enhancement of CT and MRI images, that can allow us to tell which of these are likely to turn cancerous. And those individuals, we can actually remove the cyst, even before it becomes malignant, and essentially prevent the disease," says Dr. Wallace.</p>

<p>Lifestyle changes, such as a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and quitting smoking, also can help prevent pancreatic cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>HAIP therapy targets tumors specifically in the liver, whether they are primary liver cancers or cancers that have spread from other parts of the body, most commonly the colon. The process begins with the surgical implantation of a small pump under the skin, typically in the abdomen.</p>



<p>This pump acts as a reservoir for chemotherapy, which is delivered directly to the liver through a catheter placed in the hepatic artery — the main artery supplying blood to the liver.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Hepatic artery infusion pump therapy - HAIP medical illustration" class="wp-image-395715" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg 960w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration showing placement of hepatic artery infusion pump </figcaption></figure>



<p>"The benefit of HAIP therapy is that it provides a very high dose directly to the liver, allows the chemotherapy to stay there, and can prevent some of the systemic therapy side effects that patients often experience," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>This method allows for much higher doses of chemotherapy than standard treatments. The liver receives the full force of the medication, while the rest of the body avoids common&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>chemotherapy side effects such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who benefits from HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>"Patients who have liver metastases from a colorectal tumor that are not amenable to surgery or other local therapies, we find that these patients would benefit from pump therapy, as it can help to downstage the tumors and potentially treat them. And this is true whether or not they're responding to systemic chemotherapy," says Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>Patients who have already undergone surgery to remove liver tumors also may benefit from HAIP. In these cases, HAIP is used after surgery to deliver chemotherapy directly to the liver, reducing the risk of cancer coming back. It also can help patients who haven't responded well to traditional chemotherapy.</p>



<p>"HAIP therapy does not close any doors, but can potentially open new avenues of treatment," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect during the procedure</h2>



<p>HAIP is a surgical procedure that many patients find manageable, says Dr. Poruk. During surgery, a small pump, roughly the size of a hockey puck, is implanted under the skin, usually on the right side of the abdomen. The surgeon makes an incision, locates the hepatic artery, and inserts a catheter that connects the pump to the artery. This operation can be done either open or minimally invasive, depending on the patient.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Once in place, the pump continuously delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver, where it can attack cancer cells more aggressively.</p>



<p>The pump remains in the body as long as chemotherapy is needed, typically for at least six months. After treatment is completed, the pump can be removed, although many patients continue with it if there is evidence of disease.</p>



<p>"The pump is very discreet under clothing, and most patients can wear clothes normally without anyone knowing they have it," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improving quality of life</h2>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of HAIP is its improvement in quality of life for patients compared to traditional chemotherapy. While chemotherapy affects the entire body, HAIP localizes treatment to the liver.</p>



<p>"Patients who undergo HAIP therapy are often very happy with their results and are surprised at the ease of surgery and how well they feel despite undergoing high doses of chemotherapy," she says.</p>



<p>Less side effects means patients can often maintain their daily routines with fewer interruptions.</p>



<p>The goal of HAIP, says Dr. Poruk, is not just to manage cancer but to potentially lead to a cure. Patients who were previously not candidates for surgery may find their tumors shrinking enough to be surgically removed, giving them a chance at long-term remission or even cure.</p>



<p>"This can help shrink the tumors and allow patients to undergo either curative surgery or potentially even a liver transplant," she says.</p>

<p>Brian Principe, 60, knew he needed to get a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>. He'd been putting it off for years. The truth was, he'd had the colorectal exam already — when he was in his 20s and experiencing unexplained abdominal pain. At the time, the colonoscopy detected polyps, which are abnormal tissue growths, but, he says, "No one told me how important it was to follow up."</p>



<p>Last summer, after a lot of urging from his doctor, Brian finally gave in and scheduled a screening.</p>



<p>"My doctor pulled me into his office after the colonoscopy and told me he was concerned about a small growth on my colon that was about the size of a green pea," says Brian. "He said it was really small, but it worried him."</p>



<p>After a CT scan later that day, Brian's doctor told him that not only was there a growth on his colon, but growths on his liver too. A biopsy and additional tests confirmed Brian's fears: It was <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer of the colon</a> that had spread to his liver.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Patient zero' for liver pump therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Brian met with a medical oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, who recommended standard chemotherapy every two weeks. After three months of treatment, Brian's cancer began to shrink "pretty dramatically." After six months, his tumors had shrunk by half.</p>



<p>Brian's cancer had spread too much to be completely removed with surgery. However, Brian's oncologist mentioned a treatment called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-chemotherapy-spares-livers-and-saves-lives/mac-20539443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatic artery infusion pump (HAIP) therapy</a>. He told Brian that, up until then, HAIP had only been available at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, but the Florida surgical oncology team was working to introduce it at the Jacksonville campus.</p>



<p>HAIP administers chemotherapy through an infusion pump. The pump delivers strong doses of cancer-killing chemicals straight to the liver while reducing the harmful side effects of traditional systemic chemotherapy, which travels through the entire body and damages healthy cells.</p>



<p>"My doctor said he didn't want to get my hopes up, but he wanted to talk to a surgeon about my case," Brian recalls.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/poruk-katherine-m-d/bio-20545266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Katherine Poruk</a>, surgical oncologist and leader of the HAIP program at Mayo Clinic in Florida, reviewed Brian's case and determined he would be a perfect fit for the therapy.</p>



<p>When Dr. Poruk and her team presented the option to Brian, he didn't think twice. "I didn't feel like I needed to do any research," he says. "I just trusted my doctors at Mayo that this was the best path."</p>



<p>Dr. Poruk explained to Brian that HAIP wouldn't close any doors to treatment for him. Instead, she told him, it would actually open them.</p>



<p>In March, Brian became the first patient at Mayo Clinic in Florida to have surgery to implant a pump directly into his hepatic artery so he could receive liver-directed chemotherapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An open door to future treatments</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is the only center in North Florida to offer HAIP therapy.</p>



<p>So far, six patients at Mayo Clinic in Florida have had a pump implanted for HAIP therapy — including Brian, who uses his status as "patient zero" to help others.</p>



<p>Once he learned that another patient was scheduled to have surgery to implant the pump, for example, Brian gave his nurse his name and number so the patient could call him, if he or she chose, to talk to someone who had already had the procedure.</p>



<p>"For me, this has been all about helping the next person in line," he says. "I want them to know what to expect and help them if I can. I may not have known what to expect, but I did know I was in good hands."</p>

<p>Since his surgery in March, Brian's tumors have continued to shrink and, importantly, his cancer hasn't spread further.</p>



<p>"Brian was the right person at the right time to introduce this therapy option here in Florida," Dr. Poruk says. "And it was the right thing for him too, based on his disease. This has the potential to give him future treatment options."</p>



<p>Dr. Poruk notes that if Brian's tumors shrink enough, he could be a candidate for surgery or liver transplantation down the road.</p>



<p>"I'm really looking forward to seeing how the rest of his treatment goes," she says. "I think he's got a great future with this therapy."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advocating for preventive screenings</strong></h2>



<p>Today, Brian's not limited by the pump from doing the things he enjoys, like swimming, biking, golfing and fishing — and spending time with his family, which includes his wife, three daughters and six grandchildren.</p>



<p>He also likes to pay it forward by helping others prevent colon cancer.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I ask people if they're being proactive and getting their recommended colonoscopies," says Brian. "Many of them have called to thank me later because their test did find polyps. Encouraging people to take action early has even paid off among my own family members. I tell people that getting a colonoscopy is much easier than going through cancer treatment."</p>

<p><em>When Samantha Duke discovered she had breast cancer, she didn’t have to look far for support. Her mother Jane walked a similar path 16 years earlier. Inspired both by her mom and the strong network of healthcare physicians and professionals on her team, Samantha remained positive throughout her treatment and is committed to advancing research on breast cancer.</em></p>



<p>Jane Hanson vividly recalls the day in late April 2022 when her 37-year-old daughter Samantha Duke learned that she had stage 3 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>.</p>



<p>“I remember that terrible phone call,” Jane says. “We were both just in shock — we couldn’t believe it because she was diligent about having exams and getting tested.”</p>



<p>Samantha’s vigilance about self-exams and monitoring stemmed from watching her mother battle breast cancer. Just 16 years earlier, at age 56, Jane faced her own fight with the condition.</p>



<p>“I’ve always been hyper-aware of and tracked any changes in my breast health,” says Samantha, who is an associate project manager in Supply Chain Management at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “I was in line to start preventative mammograms at age 40, but at 37 I found a lump.”</p>



<p>Samantha’s discovery of the lump in her left breast prompted a push for answers and a referral from her Mayo Clinic primary care physician to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/breast-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20459469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast Clinic</a>. Laboratory analysis of biopsied breast and lymph node tissue revealed Samantha had a high-grade adenocarcinoma. That diagnosis set Samantha on a fast-moving course through treatment and recovery walked by her mother and millions of women before her.</p>



<p>“If my mom and I were close before, we are now bound together on a whole other level,” Samantha says. “It's hard to explain actually, but it's a deep-seated connection that I will cherish going forward.”</p>



<p>Having a breast cancer survivor as one of her biggest cheerleaders provided Samantha with a positive, hope-filled perspective that colored her journey. Access to leading-edge diagnostic tools, which enabled swift characterization of her cancer, paved the way for tailored treatment that eliminated cancer cells in her body.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In terms of testing early on, I really threw all of my trust in their plan,” Samantha says. “Mayo's approach to oncology care is beyond words. It's overwhelming how many groups are available for support and care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Her mom, who has been cancer-free for 16 years, couldn’t agree more. “You just feel like it’s a big family,” Jane says. “It's so important and I think makes the patient feel so much more comfortable knowing that everybody is talking to each other. I just cannot say enough about the teamwork.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clarity, confidence, customization</strong></h2>



<p>For Samantha, who lives with her husband, Scott, and 7-year-old daughter in Rochester, the speed at which a multidisciplinary team formed around her bolstered Samantha’s sense that her care was a priority.</p>



<p>“Before any of my treatment plans started, my surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, and medical oncologist met in person to discuss my case, treatment plans, and moving forward,” Samatha says. “They all agreed on the path, making me feel so confident in what I was about to get into.”</p>



<p>The team’s decision-making process was informed by the results of Samantha’s laboratory testing. Because of Jane’s diagnosis, genetic testing was ordered to determine if Samantha had a hereditary cancer syndrome. Mayo Clinic Laboratories offers a full line of testing for hereditary cancer syndromes, including for breast and gynecological illness (Mayo ID:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/614320" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BRGYP</a>).</p>



<p>“I wanted to make sure that if this was a genetic thing, I could best prepare my daughter and make sure she has an awareness,” Samantha says. Thankfully Samantha was negative for any genetic variants that could have been passed to her daughter.</p>



<p>Immunohistochemistry testing performed on the tumor (Mayo ID:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/620800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HERMB</a>) at Mayo Clinic, however, revealed certain traits, including HER2 positivity, that painted a clearer picture of the cancer.</p>



<p>Among women who have breast cancer, about 15% have HER2-positive breast cancer, says Samantha’s medical oncologist, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20340746" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D</a>.</p>



<p>“It's a small proportion of women with breast cancer, but until the late 1990s, this was considered one of the most aggressive and lethal subtypes of breast cancer,” Dr. Leon-Ferre says.</p>



<p>The high rates of mortality for HER2 patients compelled researchers to focus on finding an effective treatment, Dr. Leon-Ferre adds.</p>



<p>“Mayo Clinic investigators were heavily involved in the original clinical studies that led to the approval of the medications that we now use routinely, and in the refinement of testing for HER2,” Dr. Leon-Ferre says. “And now that we have several effective drugs that target the HER2 protein, this is now one of the most curable subtypes of breast cancer.”</p>



<p>Among the treatments developed to specifically target HER2-positive patients was one prescribed to Samantha. TCHP chemotherapy is a four-drug cocktail that targets HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Just one month after diagnosis, Samantha received the first in a yearlong journey of infusions.</p>



<p>“The nursing staff on Gonda 10 East are nothing short of spectacular,” Samantha says, explaining that they gave her daughter a chemo Barbie with multiple wigs and a shirt that read: Strong Like Mom.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“It does take a village to treat a single patient with breast cancer,” Dr. Leon-Ferre says. “When patients come into the Breast Clinic, multiple teams of breast cancer specialists gather in that same clinic to review each case in detail. Rather than the patient moving to each one of our offices, we come to the patient. In conjunction, we determine the best treatment strategy, and we all meet with the patient that same morning.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>“The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to come together with a comprehensive plan, and on that same day the patient can leave with a clear direction of what the next steps will be,” Dr. Leon-Ferre says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Inspiration, optimism, altruism</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout Samantha’s treatment, which also included surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding tissues and 25 sessions of proton beam radiation therapy, her husband and mother were a constant support.</p>

<p>“When my diagnosis came there were a lot of emotions — fear, anger, sadness,” Samantha says. “My husband, daughter, and both of my parents were with me from the very beginning. If my husband wasn't able to be with me at an appointment or for chemotherapy sessions, my mom would be there. It was this unspoken notion that I would never be alone through the journey.”</p>



<p>Jane’s journey with cancer, which was stage 1 and HER2-negative when discovered, involved a mastectomy and taking the chemotherapy pill tamoxifen for five years. Throughout her recovery, Samantha was a key support.</p>



<p>“After her surgery, my mom needed someone to be with her, so I quit my job and stayed home to offer support,” Samantha says.</p>



<p>In Jane’s own life, having a strong support network helped her manage the anxiety and exhaustion caused by the condition.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Support_socks-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395740" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Support_socks-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Support_socks.jpg 480w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Family and friends from across the country sent Samantha support in many ways throughout her cancer journey, including this pair of socks.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>“It’s just wonderful to have family and friends to share with and talk about the journey together,” says Jane. “Samantha and I talked a lot about staying positive. But you do worry about your daughter growing up. So we talked about how Samantha would be here when her daughter graduates and we were thinking positive thoughts constantly. We were so lucky that we have each other and we can share this journey and the next.”</p>



<p>Putting a positive spin on and finding humor in her situation was essential to remain hopeful, Samantha says.</p>



<p>“Every day I looked for the positive and made fun of the situation,” Samantha says. “I don’t remember every activity, but I remember laughing a lot.”</p>



<p>The gratitude that’s grown out of her experience and outcome has motivated Samatha to use her experience to help others.</p>



<p>“I do not discount my privilege of not only working for Mayo, but for being a patient,” Samantha says. “This time in my life has taught me&amp;nbsp;about what it is to be truly grateful for all I have. Every research study they offered, I signed up for. If small pieces of good can come from my experience, then this wasn’t for nothing.”</p>



<p>Witnessing Samantha boldly face her diagnosis, push for answers, and enroll in research has been inspiring, Jane says.</p>



<p>“I'm so proud of her. She wasn’t afraid to question everything and everyone,” Jane says.</p>



<p>While Samantha’s future is not certain — she receives follow-up testing every six months — her experience has shown her that her team is prepared to handle whatever comes her way.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I may have no idea what tomorrow will bring, but knowing Mayo Clinic has my back allows me to focus on other aspects of this journey with renewed energy,” Samantha says.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Lifesaving cancer therapies can cause serious side effects, both immediately and later in life. "It is essential to continue to study innovative approaches that will eradicate the disease but won't diminish the quality of life for patients diagnosed with cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic. With breast cancer rates rising among younger people, the need for treatments that provide excellent outcomes with fewer side effects is only increasing.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> experts highlight breast cancer research that may reduce or eliminate the need for chemotherapy and endocrine treatments and may allow for shorter and less intense radiation therapy courses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Prognostic Biomarker Identified in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Potential to Reduce Chemotherapy Use</h2>



<p>Dr. Leon-Ferre's research team <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently</a> identified a prognostic biomarker in patients diagnosed with <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)</a>, a type of breast cancer that does not have estrogen or progesterone receptors and that does not have excessive expression of HER2. The researchers found that patients with high levels of naturally existing immune cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within their tumors may have a lower risk of cancer recurrence and better survival rates, even when chemotherapy is not administered.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because triple-negative breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer that does not respond to hormonal therapies or drugs targeting the HER2 protein," says Dr. Leon-Ferre. "This means treatment options are more limited, often more intense and harsher for patients. However, some patients with TNBC can be cured without chemotherapy, and the key is identifying who those patients are ahead of time." He adds that future research will explore whether TILs can be used to decide who may need and may not need chemotherapy after a TNBC diagnosis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Study Explores Necessity of Chemotherapy in Premenopausal Women with Intermediate-Risk Breast Cancer</h2>



<p>In a separate ongoing trial, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/haddad-tufia-c-m-d/bio-10029575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufia Haddad, M.D.</a>, breast medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic, is co-chair of a <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/84/9_Supplement/PO2-19-02/744254/Abstract-PO2-19-02-NRG-BR009-Phase-III-Trial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> comparing two treatment regimens in premenopausal women with intermediate-risk breast cancer: one group with chemotherapy plus ovarian suppression and hormone therapy, and another group without chemotherapy but with ovarian suppression and hormone therapy. The study aims to determine whether chemotherapy's benefits come from its ability to suppress ovarian function (thereby reducing estrogen production) or from its direct cancer-fighting effects. "The results could determine if chemotherapy is necessary or if ovarian suppression and hormone therapy alone are enough in this group of patients, sparing them from the side effects of chemotherapy," says Dr. Haddad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Endoxifen: A Potent Therapy for Estrogen-Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Explored by Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist and director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/research-programs/womens-cancer-program/breast-cancer-spore/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE)</a>, and the Erivan K. Haub Family Professor of Cancer Research Honoring Richard F. Emslander, M.D., has spent more than a decade studying the use of endoxifen for the treatment of patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer (ER-positive breast cancer or ER+), the most common subtype of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Endoxifen, the most potent byproduct of tamoxifen, stops the growth of estrogen-dependent cancer cells and blocks protein kinase C, which may contribute to the aggressiveness of some cancers. Premenopausal patients with ER+ breast cancer are treated with ovarian function suppression and aromatase inhibitors to lower estrogen levels and slow cancer growth. While effective, this regimen causes significant side effects from deep estrogen suppression. Dr. Goetz's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/specialized-programs-research-excellence-spore-grants/breast-cancer/research-projects/improving-endocrine-management-premenopausal-er-her2-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SPORE-funded study</a> explores whether endoxifen alone can eradicate cancer cells, potentially eliminating the need for more toxic treatments like chemotherapy. He is also studying the role of protein kinase C in ER+ breast cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic Study Finds Shortened and Less Intense Radiation Therapy Effective for Breast Cancer Patients</h2>



<p>Radiation therapy can be an essential part of a person's breast cancer treatment plan; however, it can lead to changes in the appearance of the skin, swelling, pain and other complications. These side effects can be detrimental to a patient's quality of life. In a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301624033893?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic breast cancer researchers found they can safely reduce the intensity and shorten the course of radiation treatment to three days for select patients with breast cancer following their lumpectomy.</p>



<p>"Normally, this treatment takes five to 15 days and can sometimes cause unwanted side effects, including changes in how the breast looks. However, this new method administers a lower dose of radiation over just three sessions using either photons, protons or brachytherapy," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mutter-robert-w-m-d/bio-20343551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Mutter, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist and lead author of the study. "The new personalized approach was well-tolerated by the patients and resulted in excellent cancer control with better long-term aesthetic results compared to what has previously been reported with longer treatments."</p>



<p>Collectively, this research is leading to innovative approaches and helping clinicians and patients make informed treatment decisions, potentially sparing patients from some of the more severe side effects of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and radiation.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm about to turn 40, and I'm nervous about getting my first mammogram. I hear they can be uncomfortable or even painful. Is breast cancer screening really that important?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It can be a bit daunting at first, but <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> screening helps people live longer. Screening can catch cancer early,<strong> </strong>either in the precancerous stage or when it's localized to a very small part of the body. When we can catch it early and decrease the risk of it coming back in the future, patients not only live longer, but they also may live with fewer symptoms and breast cancer or cancer treatment-related concerns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>A common misconception around screening is, "I don't have a family history of breast cancer, so I don't know that I need a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram</a>." That's concerning because we know 1 in 8 women get breast cancer, which is common. It's critical that, no matter what your history is, you still consider breast cancer screening for the future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We recommend that breast cancer screenings start at age 40, although these decisions should be individualized. Some patients may need screening earlier based on family history, personal history or genetic predisposition. It's not one-size-fits-all, and it's good to decide with a primary care clinician, depending on your specific risk. For example, if there are any hints of a strong breast cancer history in the family, we may consider <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/genetic-testing/about/pac-20384827" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic testing</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Traditionally, breast cancer screening is with a 3D mammogram. With breast self-exams, we recommend patients get to know their breasts — or, if they've had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a>, their chest wall — and notice if there are any changes, such as any new lumps or bumps, and then bring that to their healthcare team's attention. It's not uncommon to have breast changes over time. This can happen due to menstrual cycles or hormonal changes. But if you feel a lump that does not go away or worsens over a matter of weeks, that's a reason to get examined. Other things to look out for include flattening of the nipple, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nipple-discharge/basics/definition/sym-20050946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nipple discharge</a> or a hard lump in the underarm.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We eliminate many early-stage breast cancers with a combination of surgery, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a> and medications. Most breast cancers are very treatable and curable. With breast cancers that are detected at a later stage, there are still ways that we can suppress these cancers to help people live longer with fewer symptoms.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The question of how frequently someone needs to be screened comes up a lot. Our general guidance is annual screening with mammograms or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/3d-mammogram/about/pac-20438708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">3D mammograms</a>. For patients with a very high risk for breast cancer, extremely <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breasts</a> or another reason that makes it harder to detect breast cancer in a screening 3D mammogram, we might recommend additional or supplemental screening, often with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a> or an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MBI</a> (molecular breast imaging). It really depends on risk.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We have patients who strongly prefer or request to have screening less often. Overall, the most important parts of this process are discussing screening with your primary healthcare clinician and sharing decision-making. It's important for patients to know the general guidelines and to advocate for themselves if they're in a group that might fall outside our typical guidance, such as high-risk patients who might need to be screened earlier. Talk to your healthcare team about what's right for you. — <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cathcart-rake-elizabeth-j-m-d/bio-20558812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Elizabeth Cathcart-Rake, M.D.</em></strong></a>, <strong><em>Medical </em></strong><strong><em>Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong>&amp;nbsp;October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</em></p>



<p>Treatment for breast cancer can come in many forms. In addition to surgery to remove cancerous tissue and radiation therapy, breast cancer also is commonly treated with drugs that are taken orally or intravenously, as an infusion into a vein.</p>



<p>Drugs that treat cancer also are called systemic therapies. Types of systemic therapies for breast cancer include&amp;nbsp;chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted-drug therapy and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"The goal of systemic therapy is to either inhibit the growth of cancer cells or to eradicate them from the body," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-20054460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist. Dr. Goetz is also deputy director, translational research for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;and principal investigator of the Mayo&nbsp;Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/research-programs/womens-cancer-program/breast-cancer-spore/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breast Cancer SPORE</a>.</p>



<p>Here's an overview of the four types of systemic therapy for breast cancer:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="chemotherapy">Chemotherapy</h2>



<p>"The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>&amp;nbsp;drug treatment we think about most commonly is&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>, a medication that's usually delivered by vein," says Dr. Goetz. "Depending on the type of cancer and the situation, chemotherapy can be very effective at either eradicating or substantially reducing the total volume of cancer cells in the body."</p>



<p>Chemotherapy and drug treatments also are effective at killing cancer cells that are not yet active, which can help reduce the chance of recurrence.</p>



<p>"When a woman is first diagnosed with breast cancer and she does not have any obvious evidence for cancer that has spread throughout the body, there is a chance that there may be cancer cells that are undetected," says Dr. Goetz.</p>



<p>Chemotherapy is used often in combination with other treatments, such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy. Before or after surgery, your healthcare provider might recommend chemotherapy to shrink an existing tumor, or destroy remaining or undetected cancer cells throughout the body. This type of treatment is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/adjuvant-therapy/art-20046687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adjuvant</a>&nbsp;chemotherapy.</p>



<p>Chemotherapy can have some unpleasant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, hair loss and loss of appetite. These side effects often can be prevented and improved after treatment ends, but it's important to discuss these with your healthcare provider and weigh the options of different drug treatments for your cancer diagnosis.</p>



<p>"There may be some women who are not candidates for these medications. We certainly encounter that," says Dr. Goetz. "The good news is that we have a variety of medications, and if a woman is unable to tolerate one medication, we can try another. We know that one drug does not fit all, so having a number of different options is very important for our patients."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hormone-therapy">Hormone therapy</h2>



<p>Some types of breast cancer are fueled by natural hormones, such as estrogen or progesterone. Your health care provider can order tests to determine if this is the case for your cancer type. If it is,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hormone-therapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hormone therapy</a>&amp;nbsp;might be recommended.</p>



<p>"The most common type of breast cancer, which accounts for about 70% of breast cancers, is the estrogen-receptor-positive, or hormone-receptor-positive, type of breast cancer," says Dr. Goetz. "With this type of cancer, we know that cancer cells respond to estrogen or hormones, using them to grow or proliferate. When we use hormonal therapy, we're using drugs to either block, remove or substantially downregulate the estrogen receptor."</p>



<p>Because of the high prevalence of hormone-sensitive breast cancer, clinical trials have been conducted to determine if hormone therapy can be used as a prevention method for women who are at high risk for breast cancer. "These medications have been used in patients that are at high risk for developing breast cancer, and they are quite effective in that setting," says Dr. Goetz.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="targeted-drug-therapy">Targeted-drug therapy</h2>



<p>Like chemotherapy, targeted-drug therapy works throughout the body, and it is especially effective in cancers that have spread. But targeted-drug therapy differs from chemotherapy in how it kills cancer cells. Targeted-drug therapies focus on the abnormalities of cancer cells, particularly proteins, that allow them to survive and replicate, according to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/targeted-therapies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>.</p>



<p>Proteins such as the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, also known as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/breast-cancer/expert-answers/faq-20058066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HER2</a>, promote the growth of cancer cells. When patients have cancer that is HER2 positive, cancerous tumors can be more aggressive. "HER2 is present in about 20% of breast cancers," says Dr. Goetz.</p>



<p>"HER2-positive breast cancer was once feared by patients. When I first started my training at Mayo Clinic, we had patients who had HER2-positive breast cancer that was incurable," says Dr. Goetz. "Over the past 20 years, there have been multiple new drugs developed that have reduced the risk for HER2-positive breast cancer by 70% to 80%. Now it is something where we say 'Well, this is a good thing because we have very active drugs that can work.'"</p>



<p>Identifying the abnormalities of cancer cells can help your healthcare professional determine what targeted drugs are most effective for your cancer type.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="immunotherapy">Immunotherapy</h2>



<p>While the immune system is trained to fight off perceived threats, cancer cells can manipulate the immune system by turning off the mechanism that triggers a fight response, allowing cancer cells to replicate.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-immunotherapy-and-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immunotherapy</a>&amp;nbsp;is a newer targeted-drug therapy that teaches your immune system to identify and kill cancer cells.</p>



<p>Currently,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2022/11/29/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors-immunotherapy-for-people-with-triple-negative-breast-cancer/">immunotherapy</a>&amp;nbsp;is approved for patients with locally advanced&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/">triple-negative breast cancer</a>. Triple-negative breast cancer, also known as basal-like breast cancer, is not sensitive to hormones or the HER2 protein.</p>



<p>"When a woman has a diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer, traditionally we've used chemotherapy. But one of the real success stories in triple-negative breast cancer treatment is immunotherapy," says Dr. Goetz.</p>



<p>Triple-negative breast cancer is more likely to affect people according to race. "This type of breast cancer is seen at much higher rates in African American women than in Caucasian women," says Dr. Goetz. "It's an area of intense research focus right now."</p>



<p>Cancer experts at Mayo Clinic continue to explore how immunotherapy and other drugs — new and existing — can fight breast cancer in different populations.</p>



<p>"We need to be able to individualize treatment," says Dr. Goetz. &amp;nbsp;"As&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/weinshilboum-richard-m-d/bio-00025916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Richard Weinshilboum</a>, one of my mentors, says: 'It's about the right drug, at the right dose, for the right patient.' That's what we need to focus on."</p>
