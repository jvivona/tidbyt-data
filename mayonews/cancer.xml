<p>The thyroid is a small gland located at the front of your neck. It plays a role in regulating the body's metabolism.</p>



<p>About 44,000 people are diagnosed with thyroid cancer each year in the U.S.</p>



<p>"It appears to be the sixth-most common cancer in women and about the ninth-most common cancer in men," says Dr. Bernet.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/09/Thyroid-cancer.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-130392" /></figure></div>


<p>In the past, it was believed that women developed thyroid cancer more than men.&amp;nbsp; However, recent data shows that women are often diagnosed with a less aggressive, relatively non-life-threatening form of thyroid cancer. But when it comes to advanced thyroid cancer, the risks are the same for both men and women.</p>



<p>"Men have a risk, and we're not catching them as much," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>The cause of gender disparities in thyroid cancer is unclear. But one theory is that women are more proactive about their health and seeing their doctor regularly, leading to more diagnoses.</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;"So, in actuality, they probably don't have as much of a higher risk than we thought," explains Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>Many people don't experience symptoms of thyroid cancer. If you notice a lump or swelling in the neck, see your healthcare professional.</p>

<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/long-term-pancreatic-cancer-survivors-report-excellent-post-surgery-quality-of-life/">Pancreatic cancer</a>&amp;nbsp;begins in the pancreas, which is located behind the stomach. It is often difficult to detect early because symptoms typically appear only after the cancer has spread. As a result, it is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage, which complicates treatment.</p>



<p>One key treatment option is the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/whipple-procedure/about/pac-20385054">Whipple procedure</a>, a complex surgery that removes the head of the pancreas. There are three approaches to this challenging surgery: open, laparoscopic and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-advancing-pancreatic-cancer-treatment-with-total-robotic-whipple-surgery/">robotic</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kendrick-michael-l-m-d/bio-20054537">Dr. Michael Kendrick</a>, a hepatobiliary and pancreas surgeon at Mayo Clinic, specializes in the laparoscopic Whipple procedure. He says, depending on the location and stage, patients may need to undergo extensive treatment before surgery.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This makes the minimally invasive laparoscopic approach easier on the patient.</p>

<p>"At this point, surgery is the only potentially curartive treatment," says Dr. Kendrick.</p>

<p>However, for the best outcome, most patients with pancreatic cancer will need chemotherapy and radiation before surgery to maximize cancer outcomes. Dr. Kendrick says that after such rigorous treatments prior to surgery, minimally invasive approaches help minimize the effect on the patient's health.</p>

<p>"It's much less stress on the body than the open approach, and so most of the studies show that patients have less pain, quicker recovery, less blood loss and shorter hospital stays, which has been very beneficial," he says.</p>

<p>Laparoscopic means making small incisions and using a camera and special instruments that traverse the abdominal wall to perform the operation internally.</p>
</div></div>



<p>"The surgeon's right at the bedside, holding and controlling all of these instruments," says Dr. Kendrick.</p>



<p>After the operation, the patient wakes up with bandages rather than a large incision. These small incisions mean less pain from the operation and quicker healing time.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The minimally invasive approach is allowing people to recover quicker, which gives them more hope that after all of the treatment they've gone through&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;— the chemotherapy, the radiation, now the surgery — that finally they're going to get some of their life back. And I think that's really rewarding," Dr. Kendrick says.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic is a leader in the minimally invasive laparoscopic approach to the Whipple procedure and is one of the few medical centers offering it. Dr. Kendrick says it's important for patients to ask questions about their treatment options and get a second opinion to ensure they are getting the best possible treatment.</p>

<p>She says knowing your family's medical history is a powerful tool in preventing and managing diseases.</p>



<p>"Understanding cancers that are prevalent in the family, heart disease, diabetes — these all give us opportunities to look for these things earlier," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Close relatives, like your parents, siblings and grandparents, influence your health the most.</p>



<p>"We do want to understand those patients that have family members who are diagnosed at an early age because that may clue us in on a genetic disorder," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Consider creating a family medical tree and providing that information to your healthcare team during your annual visit.</p>

Typically, stomach cancer is diagnosed in patients in their 60s and 70s, but increasingly it's being diagnosed in younger patients. While rates of stomach cancer in older patients have been declining for decades, early onset stomach cancer is increasing and makes up around <a href="https://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(19)30299-5/abstract">30%</a> of stomach cancer diagnoses.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grotz-travis-e-m-d/bio-20342285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Travis Grotz</a>, a Mayo Clinic surgical oncologist, calls this an alarming trend and shares what people should know about the signs and symptoms of stomach cancer.</p>

<p>"It used to be a cancer of old age, you know, 70s and 80s," says Dr. Grotz. "But now I'm seeing 20-, 30-, 40-year-old people with cancer."</p>



<p>He says many younger patients with stomach cancer are being diagnosed late — when treatment is less effective.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-stomach-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of stomach cancer" class="wp-image-220699" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-stomach-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-stomach-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>"I think unfortunately, the younger patients, they often think they had a bad meal. They think — even physicians, you know, think — that it's just reflux; they're just stressed out; they're too young to have cancer," says Dr. Grotz.</p>



<p>Symptoms of gastric cancer may be dismissed as minor issues in younger people. Those symptoms can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Weight loss</li>



<li>Reflux</li>



<li>Indigestion</li>



<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>



<li>Anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>"Reflux and having heartburn, indigestion, gastritis, that can be normal, absolutely," says Dr. Grotz. "But you certainly want to be aware of that and evaluate and make sure there's not something more sinister going on."</p>



<p>As for what's causing an increase in gastric cancer among younger people, Dr. Grotz says it could be a new, unknown risk factor, possibly related to food preparation or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Minimally invasive surgery uses small incisions and special tools, causing less damage to the body than traditional surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Any minimally invasive approach, whether that's vaginal, laparoscopic, robotic — that's going to be associated with a very fast recovery. The vast majority of the time, patients are able to leave the hospital the same day," explains Dr. Wasson.</p>



<p>The most common gynecologic surgery is hysterectomy — the removal of the uterus.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/hysterectomy.jpg" alt="medical illustration of the various types of hysterectomies" class="wp-image-174317" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/hysterectomy.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/hysterectomy-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>"The vast majority of the time we are able to complete hysterectomy through a minimally invasive approach. The most minimally invasive is a vaginal hysterectomy, which does not require any incisions on the abdomen," she says.</p>



<p>Laparoscopic hysterectomy is another approach.</p>



<p>"We separate the uterus from all of the surrounding tissue, and then we remove it. And then we do still need to do a hysterectomy through a larger incision called a laparotomy, at times. Most commonly that's going to be in the setting of a cancer or if there are extremely large fibroids," says Dr. Wasson.</p>



<p>Dr. Wasson says treatment is not one-size-fits-all, and she encourages patients to ask their healthcare team questions.</p>

<p>She says the Rainbows Cancer Clinic has three main goals: to offer a welcoming, affirming space; provide clinical expertise; and conduct research to improve care.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Improving care is critical because cancer outcomes are poorer in this community.</p>



<p>"I don't think we understand exactly why that's the case, and so being able to identify where the issues are and where we can act is super important," Dr. Cathcart-Rake says.</p>



<p>And she offers these words for patients.</p>



<p>"My goal of this clinic is to make sure that I'm advancing your cancer care with a lens toward supporting your identity and your goals."</p>

<p>At 20 years old, Brescia Dover was ready to take on the world. </p>



<p>She was on her way to achieving her dream of being a professional photographer.</p>



<p>Everything was going according to plan when her dream came to a halt. Brescia was diagnosed with cancer. With her plans for her future pushed aside, Brescia's focus was now on her health and hope.</p>



<p>It's an unexpected chapter facing an increasing number of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brescia's dream</strong></h2>



<p>At 4 years old, it was clear Brescia Dover had a flare for creativity. She readily admits she was never one to miss an opportunity to play dress-up, draw pictures, or tell a story.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-as-a-little-girl-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396517" style="width:570px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-as-a-little-girl-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-as-a-little-girl-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-as-a-little-girl-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-as-a-little-girl-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">           <strong>Brescia at 4 years old                 </strong><br><strong>Photo courtesy: Brescia Dover</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Being creative has always been at the core of what I do," she says. Early on she developed a love for photography and videography. Brescia's dream was to pursue a career that allowed her to put her creative energy to work.</p>



<p>After high school Brescia's passion led her to college to study film and media production. She even traveled to Italy to study abroad. After her Italian adventure, Brescia returned to the U.S. to finish college. First, she went to her doctor for her annual checkup.</p>



<p>"I lived a really healthy, balanced lifestyle," says Brescia. "My doctor found swelling on the side of my neck. I hadn't noticed the swelling and didn't have any symptoms." Brescia was sent for an ultrasound followed by a surgical biopsy.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The diagnosis - cancer</strong></h2>



<p>The surgical biopsy revealed Brescia had <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-lymphoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hodgkin lymphoma</a>, a rare type of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-new-blood-cancer-treatment-options-with-chimeric-antigen-receptor-t-cell-therapy/">blood cancer</a>. "Being diagnosed with cancer at 20 years old was so scary and I wouldn't wish that on any 20-year-old," says Brescia. "I think about the young version of me who just found out she had cancer, and I just wish I could give her a hug."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-understanding-treating-lymphoma/">Hodgkin lymphoma</a> is a type of cancer that begins in the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-maintain-a-healthy-immune-system/">lymphatic system</a>, which is part of the immune system. Brescia says the news came as a shock because she felt healthy and had no family history of cancer. "It felt like there was something I could have done to prevent it, but I learned that there's nothing I could have done," says Brescia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Being a young adult with cancer</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-post-op-biopsy-768x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396443" style="width:293px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-post-op-biopsy-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-post-op-biopsy-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-post-op-biopsy-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-post-op-biopsy-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Brescia at Mayo Clinic <br>Photo courtesy: Brescia Dover</strong></figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"When I was going through college and diagnosed with cancer it was not what I was expecting," says Brescia. "Being a young adult with cancer was very hard and challenging. It is scary and can be very frightening."</p>



<p>At 20 years old, Brescia falls into a group of patients referred to as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adolescents and young adults with cancer</a>. AYA patients are between the ages of 15 and 39. Experts says AYA patients face a distinct set of challenges.</p>



<p>"One of the reasons this age group is so important is based on their life stage; the things they uniquely face, like body image, disruption in school and work, financial challenges, feeling isolation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rosenthal-allison-c-d-o/bio-20178616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Allison Rosenthal</a>, with the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenthal knows firsthand the challenges AYA patients face. She was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/car-t-cell-therapy-restores-hope-for-leukemia-patient/">leukemia</a> during medical school. "I had leukemia in medical school. There were a lot of missed opportunities in my care to recognize the issues that I might face as a 24-year-old woman," explains Dr. Rosenthal.</p>



<p>Putting her experience into action, Dr. Rosenthal championed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Adolescent and Young Adults with Cancer program</a>. The program is tailored to meet the unique needs of AYA patients to include medical care, fertility concerns, social and relationship issues, school and work concerns, and the personal and emotional impact of cancer in this age group.</p>

<p>Brescia underwent about four months of chemotherapy treatment under the care of Dr. Rosenthal. "She did a beautiful job of explaining to me what the process was going to look like and what my treatment plan was going to look like. Because I'm so young, she walked me through the whole process," says Brescia. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cancer-free and focused on the future</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="946" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-celebrates-five-year-cancer-free-1024x946.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396530" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-celebrates-five-year-cancer-free-1024x946.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-celebrates-five-year-cancer-free-300x277.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-celebrates-five-year-cancer-free-768x709.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-celebrates-five-year-cancer-free-1536x1419.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Brescia-celebrates-five-year-cancer-free-2048x1892.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Photo courtesy: Brescia Dover</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>After her cancer treatments, Brescia returned to college and got her degree. She the started her own marketing agency providing social media management, videography, photography, and brand development with her personal creative touch. She also celebrated her five-year anniversary of being cancer-free.</p>



<p>"I also have a podcast called the Checkered Jaguar where I get to have incredible conversations with people, share their stories and connect people who may be going through similar challenges that I went through," says Brescia. "We're all in this journey together and just being open and vulnerable with my journey, as challenging as it may be, I feel like it connects me to people all around the world."</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer is the third-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S.</p>



<p>"Our best way of finding a disease at a curable stage is to find it early," says Dr. Wallace.</p>



<p>Patients with a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">family history </a>of pancreatic disease are at the greatest risk and should be screened annually with an MRI or an endoscopic ultrasound.</p>



<p>"If we see something abnormal, we can actually take a biopsy directly of it, and that's a very, very safe procedure," he explains.</p>



<p>Artificial intelligence (AI) also is helping doctors at Mayo Clinic detect the disease earlier.</p>



<p>"We now have very good ways, including some recent advances in artificial intelligence, enhancement of CT and MRI images, that can allow us to tell which of these are likely to turn cancerous. And those individuals, we can actually remove the cyst, even before it becomes malignant, and essentially prevent the disease," says Dr. Wallace.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>HAIP therapy targets tumors specifically in the liver, whether they are primary liver cancers or cancers that have spread from other parts of the body, most commonly the colon. The process begins with the surgical implantation of a small pump under the skin, typically in the abdomen.</p>



<p>This pump acts as a reservoir for chemotherapy, which is delivered directly to the liver through a catheter placed in the hepatic artery — the main artery supplying blood to the liver.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Hepatic artery infusion pump therapy - HAIP medical illustration" class="wp-image-395715" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg 960w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration showing placement of hepatic artery infusion pump </figcaption></figure>



<p>"The benefit of HAIP therapy is that it provides a very high dose directly to the liver, allows the chemotherapy to stay there, and can prevent some of the systemic therapy side effects that patients often experience," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>This method allows for much higher doses of chemotherapy than standard treatments. The liver receives the full force of the medication, while the rest of the body avoids common&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>chemotherapy side effects such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who benefits from HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>"Patients who have liver metastases from a colorectal tumor that are not amenable to surgery or other local therapies, we find that these patients would benefit from pump therapy, as it can help to downstage the tumors and potentially treat them. And this is true whether or not they're responding to systemic chemotherapy," says Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>Patients who have already undergone surgery to remove liver tumors also may benefit from HAIP. In these cases, HAIP is used after surgery to deliver chemotherapy directly to the liver, reducing the risk of cancer coming back. It also can help patients who haven't responded well to traditional chemotherapy.</p>



<p>"HAIP therapy does not close any doors, but can potentially open new avenues of treatment," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect during the procedure</h2>



<p>HAIP is a surgical procedure that many patients find manageable, says Dr. Poruk. During surgery, a small pump, roughly the size of a hockey puck, is implanted under the skin, usually on the right side of the abdomen. The surgeon makes an incision, locates the hepatic artery, and inserts a catheter that connects the pump to the artery. This operation can be done either open or minimally invasive, depending on the patient.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Once in place, the pump continuously delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver, where it can attack cancer cells more aggressively.</p>



<p>The pump remains in the body as long as chemotherapy is needed, typically for at least six months. After treatment is completed, the pump can be removed, although many patients continue with it if there is evidence of disease.</p>



<p>"The pump is very discreet under clothing, and most patients can wear clothes normally without anyone knowing they have it," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improving quality of life</h2>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of HAIP is its improvement in quality of life for patients compared to traditional chemotherapy. While chemotherapy affects the entire body, HAIP localizes treatment to the liver.</p>



<p>"Patients who undergo HAIP therapy are often very happy with their results and are surprised at the ease of surgery and how well they feel despite undergoing high doses of chemotherapy," she says.</p>



<p>Less side effects means patients can often maintain their daily routines with fewer interruptions.</p>



<p>The goal of HAIP, says Dr. Poruk, is not just to manage cancer but to potentially lead to a cure. Patients who were previously not candidates for surgery may find their tumors shrinking enough to be surgically removed, giving them a chance at long-term remission or even cure.</p>



<p>"This can help shrink the tumors and allow patients to undergo either curative surgery or potentially even a liver transplant," she says.</p>

<p>Brian Principe, 60, knew he needed to get a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>. He'd been putting it off for years. The truth was, he'd had the colorectal exam already — when he was in his 20s and experiencing unexplained abdominal pain. At the time, the colonoscopy detected polyps, which are abnormal tissue growths, but, he says, "No one told me how important it was to follow up."</p>



<p>Last summer, after a lot of urging from his doctor, Brian finally gave in and scheduled a screening.</p>



<p>"My doctor pulled me into his office after the colonoscopy and told me he was concerned about a small growth on my colon that was about the size of a green pea," says Brian. "He said it was really small, but it worried him."</p>



<p>After a CT scan later that day, Brian's doctor told him that not only was there a growth on his colon, but growths on his liver too. A biopsy and additional tests confirmed Brian's fears: It was <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer of the colon</a> that had spread to his liver.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Patient zero' for liver pump therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Brian met with a medical oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, who recommended standard chemotherapy every two weeks. After three months of treatment, Brian's cancer began to shrink "pretty dramatically." After six months, his tumors had shrunk by half.</p>



<p>Brian's cancer had spread too much to be completely removed with surgery. However, Brian's oncologist mentioned a treatment called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-chemotherapy-spares-livers-and-saves-lives/mac-20539443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatic artery infusion pump (HAIP) therapy</a>. He told Brian that, up until then, HAIP had only been available at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, but the Florida surgical oncology team was working to introduce it at the Jacksonville campus.</p>



<p>HAIP administers chemotherapy through an infusion pump. The pump delivers strong doses of cancer-killing chemicals straight to the liver while reducing the harmful side effects of traditional systemic chemotherapy, which travels through the entire body and damages healthy cells.</p>



<p>"My doctor said he didn't want to get my hopes up, but he wanted to talk to a surgeon about my case," Brian recalls.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/poruk-katherine-m-d/bio-20545266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Katherine Poruk</a>, surgical oncologist and leader of the HAIP program at Mayo Clinic in Florida, reviewed Brian's case and determined he would be a perfect fit for the therapy.</p>



<p>When Dr. Poruk and her team presented the option to Brian, he didn't think twice. "I didn't feel like I needed to do any research," he says. "I just trusted my doctors at Mayo that this was the best path."</p>



<p>Dr. Poruk explained to Brian that HAIP wouldn't close any doors to treatment for him. Instead, she told him, it would actually open them.</p>



<p>In March, Brian became the first patient at Mayo Clinic in Florida to have surgery to implant a pump directly into his hepatic artery so he could receive liver-directed chemotherapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An open door to future treatments</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic is the only center in North Florida to offer HAIP therapy.</p>



<p>So far, six patients at Mayo Clinic in Florida have had a pump implanted for HAIP therapy — including Brian, who uses his status as "patient zero" to help others.</p>



<p>Once he learned that another patient was scheduled to have surgery to implant the pump, for example, Brian gave his nurse his name and number so the patient could call him, if he or she chose, to talk to someone who had already had the procedure.</p>



<p>"For me, this has been all about helping the next person in line," he says. "I want them to know what to expect and help them if I can. I may not have known what to expect, but I did know I was in good hands."</p>

<p>Since his surgery in March, Brian's tumors have continued to shrink and, importantly, his cancer hasn't spread further.</p>



<p>"Brian was the right person at the right time to introduce this therapy option here in Florida," Dr. Poruk says. "And it was the right thing for him too, based on his disease. This has the potential to give him future treatment options."</p>



<p>Dr. Poruk notes that if Brian's tumors shrink enough, he could be a candidate for surgery or liver transplantation down the road.</p>



<p>"I'm really looking forward to seeing how the rest of his treatment goes," she says. "I think he's got a great future with this therapy."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advocating for preventive screenings</strong></h2>



<p>Today, Brian's not limited by the pump from doing the things he enjoys, like swimming, biking, golfing and fishing — and spending time with his family, which includes his wife, three daughters and six grandchildren.</p>



<p>He also likes to pay it forward by helping others prevent colon cancer.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I ask people if they're being proactive and getting their recommended colonoscopies," says Brian. "Many of them have called to thank me later because their test did find polyps. Encouraging people to take action early has even paid off among my own family members. I tell people that getting a colonoscopy is much easier than going through cancer treatment."</p>
