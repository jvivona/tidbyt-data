<p>A new solution is transforming cardiac care by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in point-of-care ultrasound. This innovation enables a wider range of medical professionals to capture high-quality cardiac images with confidence, ultimately enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving clinical outcomes. Check out the latest episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodesix&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=global&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=190205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow's Cure</a> to learn more.</p>



<p>The podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/friedman-paul-a-m-d/bio-20053442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Paul Friedman</a>, cardiologist and chair of Cardiovascular Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and <a href="https://ultrasight.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Davidi Vortman</a>, CEO of UltraSight. Together, Mayo Clinic and UltraSight are at the forefront of developing algorithms to analyze and interpret cardiac ultrasound images. The collaboration seeks to create a comprehensive solution to support diagnostic and treatment decisions using point-of-care ultrasound devices.</p>



<p>This AI-driven technology is designed to overcome existing barriers and expand access to high-quality cardiac imaging and diagnostics. UltraSight's innovation simplifies cardiac sonography by providing real-time guidance on maneuvering the ultrasound probe to capture high-quality images. Now, with the added power of AI, healthcare professionals can analyze those images more effectively.</p>



<p>"Historically, ultrasound has been somewhat difficult for an average person to get," says Dr. Friedman. "So, in many places around the world, if a physician orders an ultrasound of the heart, an echocardiogram, it may take several months to be scheduled."</p>



<p>"It hasn't been used for first-line screening because of those barriers. This is where some of the visionary work of a portable device that uses AI can turn that upside," he adds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe id="videoidGW51QljkG54"  title="How Next-Gen Ultrasound Improves Cardiac Care | Tomorrow&amp;#039;s Cure Season 2 Episode 6" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GW51QljkG54?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>This innovative technology isn't about replacing experts, notes Vortman. "We're not replacing the experts, we are giving them more data from more patients, faster than ever before. So AI is an accelerator for access that gives much better data at the right time," he says.</p>



<p>"It doesn't replace human interpretation and action, but it can provide a common groundwork for consistency," Dr. Friedman adds.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Vortman envisions a future where diagnostic tools are more accessible and affordable. "This is the future. Diagnostic tools like ultrasound that are low-cost and can be used by a wider variety of healthcare team members are going to be future of healthcare and disease detection," he says.</p>



<p>The collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic and UltraSight holds the potential to democratize cardiac care, offering hope faster and more efficiently.

<p>"It's usually recommended for you to sleep at least seven hours per night in order to allow your body to recover to be ready for the following day," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical steps to help you get better sleep</strong></h2>



<p>"Try to sleep at the same time. Try to get a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and you're waking up also at the same time, that's very important," Dr. Cardenas Rosales says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create good sleep habits</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.</li>



<li>Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.</li>



<li>Limit naps or do not nap at all.</li>



<li>Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.</li>



<li>Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.</li>



<li>Make your bedroom comfortable.</li>



<li>Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You want to set up the environment to make it easier for your body to fall asleep," he says.</p>

<p>In AVS, calcium deposits build up and narrow the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to move blood. The condition typically progresses over time, with symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue affecting people over age 65. The current standard of care — watchful waiting — often leads to reduced quality of life before the condition is severe enough for the patient to have a surgical or interventional <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valve replacement</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Miller notes that the impact extends beyond simply delaying surgery. Younger patients with aggressive disease or congenital valve defects may develop symptoms in midlife. If a patient requires valve replacement before the age of 55, there is a more than 50% likelihood they will require multiple valve replacement surgeries over their lifetime due to recalcification of the implanted valve. Ataciguat, which slowed progression of native aortic valve calcification in the clinical trial, offers the potential for a once-in-a-lifetime procedure if they can reach the age of 65. The older a patient is, the less likely the implanted valve is to calcify.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Mayo Clinic's research revealed that ataciguat reactivates a pathway crucial in preventing valvular calcification and stenosis. Preclinical studies in mice showed that this drug substantially slowed disease progression even when treatment began after the disease was established. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical trials in patients with moderate AVS demonstrated that once-daily ataciguat dosing was well tolerated, with minimal side effects compared to placebo. This latest phase 2 trial in 23 patients showed a 69.8% reduction in aortic valve calcification progression at six months compared to placebo, and patients receiving ataciguat tended to maintain better heart muscle function. Crucially, the research team confirmed that — despite its profound effect on slowing valve calcification — ataciguat did not negatively impact bone formation.</p>



<p>This important finding is the result of a collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Minnesota, and Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The research was conducted under an innovative academic-industry partnership grant administered by the National Center for Accelerating Translational Sciences and a Minnesota Biotechnology and Genomics Partnership grant.</p>

<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken, making it harder to pump blood and sometimes causing an irregular heart rhythm.</p>



<p>"So right now, what we think in the United States, we've only diagnosed 1/7 of the people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So we're trying to increase the awareness in the community about this disease," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says patients are born with a genetic mutation. The disease can start at a young age or later in life — many times with no symptoms.&amp;nbsp; </p>



<p>"We know the patients that we lose to this condition, the majority of them are young, active and athletes. So high-level athletic exercise can put you at higher risk of sudden cardiac death," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says it's important to seek medical attention if you have any symptoms, especially with exertion, "including shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheaded, dizzy or passing out."</p>



<p>If diagnosed, the good news is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be treated with medications, surgery, implanting a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defibrillator</a> that monitors the heart or, in severe cases, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplantation</a>.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Proton beam therapy is a form of radiation treatment that uses a precise beam of protons to deliver targeted radiation. Now, a clinical trial is exploring the use of proton beam therapy to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT).</p>



<p>"Ventricular tachycardia is a type of fast heart rhythm that we see in people who have almost any type of heart disease. It can be an old heart attack, heart valve surgery or cardiomyopathy, which is a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle," says Dr. Stevenson. "What's common to many of these things is that they'll produce an area of scar in the heart. If you have an area of scar in your pumping chambers, it's almost like having a little electrical circuit in that scar. When the right thing comes along to trigger it off, it goes each time around the circuit as a heartbeat, and it can cause episodes of sudden rapid heart action, which are ventricular tachycardia."</p>



<p>Treatment of VT aims at restoring normal heart rhythm and can include medication, use of a defibrillator and catheter ablation. Unlike catheter ablation, proton beam therapy is completely noninvasive and can be delivered directly to the target in the heart.</p>



<p>"The idea of targeting any-size lesion in the middle of the patient without having to put the patient under anesthesia or any sort of access to veins or chest cavity, sounds like it's right up our alley," says Dr. Deisher.</p>



<p>The clinical trial using proton beam therapy to treat VT offers promise for patients who continue to battle the condition despite previous treatments.</p>



<p>Dr. Siontis discusses the results of the study thus far, "I certainly think that there were some patients who benefited from radiation with protons when everything else that we did for them, including multiple catheter ablation procedures and medications, had failed. I think adding noninvasive options generates a broad spectrum of options for patients who have the most difficult arrhythmias."

<p><em>February is Heart Month in many countries</em></p>



<p>LONDON — You may have heard that people who feel faint should sit with their heads between their knees, but is that true? And how can you tell whether you or someone else who has fainted should go to the emergency department or perhaps even see a cardiologist? <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/doctors/elijah-r-behr-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elijah Behr, M.D.</a>, a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a>&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare</a>&amp;nbsp;in London, explains five things it is important to know about fainting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-fainting/basics/art-20056606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fainting</a> or blacking out, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness due to insufficient blood flow to the brain. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are different types of syncope</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vasovagal syncope</a> is the medical term for the most benign kind of fainting, simple fainting without a serious underlying cause, Dr. Behr explains. This type of fainting is common.</p>



<p>"In some people, if they have a drop in blood pressure from emotional distress, pain, illness or dehydration, for example, or just generally have a low blood pressure, any provocation causes a reflex in the heart," Dr. Behr says. "Rather than the heart speeding up and pumping more forcefully to maintain the blood pressure, it starts to slow down. The blood pressure drops, the heart rate slows further, and the heart can pause for many seconds; sometimes close to a minute for some people who have more severe fainting episodes."</p>



<p>Usually with this type of fainting, the person falls to the floor, blood pressure returns to the brain and the person starts to recover. However, if someone faints in a vulnerable location or vulnerable position, it can be dangerous to that person and others, Dr. Behr notes.</p>



<p>The syncope that most concerns healthcare professionals is cardiac syncope, blacking out due to an underlying heart disease such as a heart rhythm abnormality, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/arrhythmia-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrhythmia</a>, he explains.</p>



<p>"This is usually a more abrupt loss and return of consciousness than in simple fainting. If you're older, you're more likely to have underlying <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a> that you may or may not be aware of. That's one of the reasons to be more concerned about loss of consciousness in older individuals," Dr. Behr says. "Young people can also have heart diseases that can cause cardiac syncope that may be a warning sign of something more serious to come, so it is important to investigate it."</p>



<p>Others for whom a blackout can be a warning sign of a serious heart problem include people with a family history of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inherited heart problems</a>, unexplained deaths or premature sudden deaths; people whose fainting is related to exercise; and people whose fainting is associated with heart palpitations or the heart feeling like it's racing away, he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before a simple faint, you might experience one or more signs that you should sit or lie down</h2>



<p>"There will be a sensation of lightheadedness. There may be a sensation of nausea or buzzing or ringing in the ears," Dr. Behr says. "Some people describe tunnel vision — their vision closing in on them before they actually pass out — and some may actually lose vision but still be aware, not lose consciousness completely, and then recover. Other typical signs include feeling sweaty and clammy."</p>



<p>Some people get about a half-hour of warnings before fainting; some people may get 30 seconds, he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do if you faint or someone else does:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Check that the person is breathing and has a pulse. If not, call for emergency help, and if you know how to provide <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-cpr/basics/art-20056600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a>, initiate it.</li>



<li>If the person is still breathing and has a pulse, ensure they are lying flat, and their airway is open using the recovery position and call for help.</li>



<li>If you feel like a faint may be coming on, position your head lower than your heart: for example, between the knees.</li>



<li>Rest after coming out of the faint.</li>



<li>Drink water after the faint, adding electrolytes if you have them.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If your blood pressure is getting low and you're getting those symptoms, it means the blood doesn't get into your brain, and if your heart is trying to push the blood to your brain against gravity, then it's struggling. You really need to get your head level or below your heart so the blood pressure gets back to the brain, and that will avert all the symptoms and the vicious cycle that ensues," Dr. Behr advises. "Get your head between your knees or lie down and put your head down and your feet up in the air, depending on where you are and what is feasible to do."</p>



<p>Getting up and walking around straight away is probably the worst thing to do, he warns.</p>



<p>"Your blood pressure will drop further, and you’ll feel worse, and collapse and fall and injure yourself," Dr. Behr says. "The best thing is to stay where you are and get flat, and when you're feeling better, drink some water, maybe with some electrolytes if you're dehydrated. For general preventive measures, we advise most people who have fainted to drink more water and to sometimes add a bit of salt to their food, because generally they're running a low blood pressure."</p>



<p>Sometimes, getting hydrated and adding salt to the diet may not be enough. Occasionally people need to take medications to improve blood pressure control and increase blood pressure to prevent fainting episodes, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical help</h2>



<p>"If somebody has had simple fainting with the clear precipitants that I described, it is best to have a chat with your GP (your primary care physician) to talk about it. Particularly if it's a first onset of symptoms, it's best not to ignore it," Dr. Behr says. "Often people go to the emergency department after a first faint, which I think is very fair to do and I would encourage."</p>



<p>If someone has had simple faints before, the circumstances that bring them on are typical for them and they have been evaluated by their primary care physician or a cardiologist before, they may not need to go to the emergency department every time, he adds.</p>



<p>The more concerning situations are older people having faints where other conditions may also be having an effect, people who are having recurrent faints despite keeping well hydrated, if there has been an injury due to a faint, and if the blackout comes on abruptly and with other signs that there may be an underlying cardiac condition.</p>



<p>"We need to make sure that they are treated and that something else isn't being missed," Dr. Behr says. "Also, sometimes faints can look like seizures. They can cause fitting activity, and differentiating a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seizure and epilepsy</a> from fainting requires involvement of a cardiologist and neurologist."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you faint at the sight of blood, you may be able to condition yourself not to</h2>



<p>"It's very common, but it can be surmounted by various means," Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioural therapy</a> (CBT) may help, he suggests. In CBT, you work with a mental health counselor such as a psychotherapist or therapist to become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking, so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them more effectively.</p>

But what about&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-what-are-triglycerides-and-why-do-they-matter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triglycerides</a>? Often that word gets skimmed over when talking about cholesterol levels.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fernandes-regis-i-m-d/bio-20305254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Regis Fernandes</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says triglycerides provide the body with energy from food.

<p>Triglycerides, the main kind of fat in your body, store extra energy from the food you eat.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's an energy source. It's like a little battery used for energy. But too many triglycerides can also cause heart disease," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<p>People who are overweight, in general, have high triglyceride levels and good cholesterol levels that are low.</p>



<p>"They may get heart disease not because their LDL is high, they get heart disease because the HDL is low and the triglycerides is high," he says.</p>



<p>And this is significant for people in their 30s and 40s.</p>



<p>So what can you do?&amp;nbsp;Reducing simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours, can help lower your weight and improve your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. And you can back that up with exercise.</p>



<p>"One of the best ways to lower triglyceride levels is to exercise. Also, exercise helps to lose weight. And when you lose weight, your triglycerides improve a lot," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips to lower triglcyerides&amp;nbsp;</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li>Cut sugar and refined carbs.</li>



<li>Lose weight and focus on reducing calories.</li>



<li>Choose healthier fats like olive oil and fish that are rich in omega-3.</li>



<li>Limit alcohol, which can be high in calories and sugar.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>Medications, including&amp;nbsp;statins,&amp;nbsp;may be prescribed if lifestyle modifications don't help.</p>

<p>The stethoscope, one of the most iconic symbols of medicine, was invented over 200 years ago. Today, artificial intelligence is revolutionizing this essential tool, empowering doctors to detect cardiac disease at its earliest stages with greater precision. Discover these groundbreaking advancements on a new episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodefour&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=global&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=190203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow's Cure</a>.</p>



<p>The podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo, </a>cardiologist, and Jason Bellet, co-founder of Eko Health. Together, they discuss innovative and lifesaving technology that is transforming heart health.</p>



<p>The AI-powered digital stethoscope, developed by Eko Health, captures electrocardiogram (ECG) data and heart sounds. This advanced tool enhances the detection of peripartum cardiomyopathy, a serious yet treatable condition that weakens the heart muscle during pregnancy or postpartum.</p>



<p>"There is a diagnostic gap when it comes to how do we identify a high index of suspicion and how we make it to that diagnosis," explains Dr. Adedinsewo. "Also, we do not have a simple, noninvasive screening test that is safe for mother and the baby."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Recognizing a weak heart pump caused by pregnancy is crucial because its symptoms — shortness of breath when lying down, swelling in the hands and feet, weight gain, and rapid heartbeat — can easily be mistaken for normal pregnancy-related conditions.</p>



<p>"We really believe that this technology has the ability to improve access to early detection, which then can inform the patient to go to a cardiologist on a more expedited timeline and get the advanced care they need," Bellet says. "If we can just detect heart murmurs that much better or AFib that much better in the physical exam, we can then get those patients referred into cardiology faster, get the echocardiogram and, hopefully, get the treatment they need earlier."</p>



<p>This technology holds immense potential to revolutionize the healthcare field.</p>



<p>"Our vision is to create a pipeline of algorithms such that when you put the stethoscope on the chest in a future physical exam, we'll be able to take those 15 to 30 seconds of heart sounds — and eventually lung sounds — and analyze them for a host of conditions, really turning that wellness visit that we all know with our provider that can be 15, 30 or 45 minutes into a really powerful early detection opportunity," Bellet says. </p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart surgery is a serious and invasive medical procedure, and that can be intimidating for a patient. A new study <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00474-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a> suggests that <a href="https://tryhealium.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual reality (VR)</a> can be an effective tool to reduce preoperative anxiety in older patients undergoing their first <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20123422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-heart surgery</a>. While much of the research to date using VR involved younger patient populations, these research findings suggest that immersive VR was effective and well tolerated in older patients. These reductions in anxiety are particularly significant given the known link between preoperative anxiety and negative postoperative outcomes, including increased pain, reduced activity and higher medication use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research represents a step forward in improving the patient experience and potentially using this approach to optimize postoperative recovery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, a cardiovascular disease researcher at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and senior author of the study.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dearani-joseph-a-m-d/bio-00083538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Dearani, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stulak-john-m-m-d/bio-20133266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Stulak, M.D.</a>, both cardiac surgeons at Mayo Clinic involved with the study, emphasize the importance of emotional state before and after cardiac surgery. "We currently offer music and massage therapy after cardiac surgery because we know what a negative impact high anxiety has on recovery from surgery. Our team is now exploring broader implementation of VR — which can be used at any time and place, inside or outside the hospital — throughout the surgical episode to further evaluate its impact on clinical outcomes."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional anti-anxiety medications, which can have drawbacks such as increased difficulty placing the tube that helps a patient breathe during surgery and a longer time to remove the tube after surgery, VR offers a nonpharmacological alternative. The study also highlights the potential of VR as a flexible tool, with the tablet-based option providing a viable alternative for patients susceptible to VR-induced motion sickness.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research included 100 participants who were scheduled for open-heart surgery. Each patient wore a monitor to record vital signs and completed a standardized, clinically validated anxiety test before and after the VR intervention on the day of surgery. The test asked them to rate their current state with 20 questions related to feelings ranging from calm to upset. Participants rated each feeling on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being "not at all" and 4 being "very much."&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="168" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Seasons_Change_High_Res-300x168.png" alt="" class="wp-image-399788" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Seasons_Change_High_Res-300x168.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Seasons_Change_High_Res-1024x575.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Seasons_Change_High_Res-768x431.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Seasons_Change_High_Res-1536x863.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Seasons_Change_High_Res-2048x1150.png 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></figure></div>


<p>Half of the participants were assigned to a VR tablet and the other half to immersive VR goggles while they waited in the holding area prior to surgery. The VR provided a 10-minute nature experience with guided breathing as they viewed trees and a waterfront that changed through four seasons. The tablet played a video of the content seen by patients in VR, while people who used the immersive VR headset were able to look all around and identify environmental features, which helped them advance through the scene. Both interventions reduced the pulse rate of participants, but they did not affect respiration rate or oxygen levels.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall anxiety scores decreased an average of 2 points with the tablet treatment and 2.9 points with the VR goggles. Additionally, the researchers note that the scores improved considerably in up to seven of the anxiety-focused questions with the tablet and VR goggles. Several of those responses specifically represent a more positive outlook change from their previously negative feelings — a finding that has the researchers feeling optimistic about the abilities of VR to make surgery less stressful for patients.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — It’s not unusual to have one or more family members with some form of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/search-results?q=Heart%20disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>. Nonetheless, some people may not even know they have heart disease until they experience a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> or are diagnosed with heart failure. Despite the prevalence of heart disease, many people are still unclear about how genetics can impact heart disease and, most importantly, what they can do to lower their risk. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kopecky-stephen-l-m-d/bio-20054286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen Kopecky, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, explains how you can improve your heart health, even if your family has a history of cardiovascular problems.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Kopecky-Stephen-L.-MD_10023313_201905210207-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399668" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Kopecky-Stephen-L.-MD_10023313_201905210207-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Kopecky-Stephen-L.-MD_10023313_201905210207.jpg 667w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Stephen Kopecky, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Heart disease is a broad term that describes several conditions impacting the heart's structure and function. The most common type of heart disease is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary heart disease</a> typically caused by plaque buildup in and around the artery walls on the heart. But you may also have heard of heart valve disease, heart muscle disease (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>), conditions involving the heart's electrical system, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adult-congenital-heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20355456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congenital heart disease</a>. The exact symptoms depends on the type and severity of the disease.</p>



<p>Lifestyle factors — encompassing how much you move, what you eat, how well you sleep and more — play the biggest role in your heart health, Dr. Kopecky says. But circumstances you can’t control — namely, your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-genomics-program/overview/ovc-20442075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetics and family history</a> — also impact your risk of heart disease.</p>



<p>Congenital heart disease, for example, is thought to run in families — meaning the condition may be passed down, also called inherited, from parent to child. Other research indicates that some genetic conditions, such as Down syndrome and certain types of muscular dystrophy, may be linked to cardiovascular conditions.</p>



<p>Family history may have a hand in heart disease that develops later in life as well. Though the exact numbers range, research consistently indicates that people with a family history of coronary artery disease, for example, have a significantly higher risk of developing the condition themselves. Similarly, people from families with two or more premature heart-related deaths have a three times higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease themselves before age 50.</p>



<p>Understanding your family history is an important piece of the puzzle, according to Dr. Kopecky. But it’s equally important not to blow genetic risk out of proportion. Genetics account for 20% to 30% of your risk, Dr. Kopecky says. But positive habits such as regular exercise and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20047702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy diet</a> can impact your genes much more drastically.</p>



<p>“Certain good lifestyles can ‘turn off’ the bad genes and ‘turn on’ the good genes,” Dr. Kopecky explains. “We see patients in our prevention clinic with very high cholesterol, genetically determined. We know that if they have a good lifestyle, starting early in life, it lowers their heart attack and stroke risk.” In other words, Dr. Kopecky says the day-to-day, year-over-year habits you make to protect your heart health are oftentimes much more impactful than the genetic lottery.</p>



<p>There’s no magic or any one routine that will prevent heart disease and its more serious complications such as heart attack and stroke. By now, most people know it’s the small, consistent choices in all parts of life that add up in big ways.</p>



<p>“If you have genetic risk factors, it’s more important to have a healthy lifestyle,” Dr. Kopecky says. “I tell patients frequently: You have a new part-time job called ‘your health’.”</p>



<p>To get started, consider the following strategies:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Incorporate a variety of nutritious foods.</strong>&amp;nbsp;When making choices for meals and snacks, emphasize fresh fruits, vegetables, legumes and whole grains. Limit overly sugary, salty and processed foods that can raise blood pressure and cholesterol.</li>



<li><strong>Move as much as you can.</strong>&amp;nbsp;For adults, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate activity every week. Exercise can help lower blood pressure, decrease cholesterol levels and maintain a heart-healthy weight. To get started, Dr. Kopecky recommends incorporating as much movement into your day as possible — and making time for light strength training and interval workouts as often as you can. Gardening, walking and taking the stairs all count!</li>



<li><strong>Prioritize sleep.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Dr. Kopecky says getting enough quality sleep is critical for your heart health and overall quality of life. To ensure you’re well rested, Dr. Kopecky recommends consistently going to bed and waking up at the same time. “Don’t set an alarm to wake up. Set an alarm to go to sleep or get ready to go to bed,” he adds. “You shouldn’t need an alarm to wake up unless you’re traveling. Just wake up on your own.”</li>



<li><strong>Quit smoking and avoid alcohol.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Heart attacks are more common in people who smoke. If you use any tobacco products, quitting as soon as possible helps lower your risk of heart disease. Similarly, it’s a good idea to limit your alcohol intake or avoid alcohol altogether.</li>



<li><strong>Lean on your healthcare team.</strong>&amp;nbsp;If you have a family history of heart attack or heart disease — especially in first-degree relatives such as parents or siblings — or are unsure of your risk, talk with your healthcare team. Your care team also can help you determine the best plan for protecting your heart health.</li>
</ul>



<p>Though it can seem overwhelming to make so many changes, just remember: Dr. Kopecky says nothing you do is ever too little or too late. When it comes to your heart health, you may find that positive reinforcement is a much more powerful motivator than shame or fear. Even small changes can compound and help protect your heart health, so do what you can as often as you can and celebrate the successes along the way.</p>
