<p>Do your feet always feel <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/cold-feet-that-arent-cold-to-the-touch-may-indicate-neurologic-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cold</a>, even when it's not chilly outside?

<p>Sometimes, cold feet simply mean you need warmer socks. But if your feet are always cold, no matter the weather, it might be something more.</p>



<p>"Anything from circulatory problems, not having adequate blood flow, heart condition problems, immune or autoimmune conditions such as like having thyroid disease, and sometimes nerve or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352061?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;cauid=100721">neuropathic </a>problems. Having nerve disorders can cause cold feet," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<p>Where to start? He offers a few immediate steps.</p>



<p>"Warm socks, lifting your feet, staying hydrated, diet, nutrition is really important. Exercise is important. And, obviously, if you smoke, don't smoke," he says.</p>



<p>If your feet remain to feel cold but are not cold to the touch, it might be time to see your healthcare team.</p>



<p>"There are certain tests that it can easily be done to ensure that you have no circulatory issues, and a few blood tests may be warranted just to make sure you have no autoimmune issues or even signs of anemia," Dr. Bracamonte says.</p>

<p>Let's start with sleep.</p>



<p>"Seven to eight hours of sleep at night is recommended for ideal cardiovascular health," says Dr. Adedinsewo. "Fewer hours or poor-quality sleep can lead to physical symptoms that impact the rest of your body, including your heart."</p>



<p>In addition to sleep, it's important to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Maintain an appropriate weight.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep blood glucose, blood cholesterol and blood pressure within range.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke exposure.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Follow an eating plan rich in nutrients, such as the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721">DASH</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721">diets</a>.</li>

"This does not necessarily have to be split up 30 minutes, five days a week, even though that's an easy way that we think about it. Really, every little thing that you do adds up."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;We hear a lot about "<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-navigating-nutrition-for-heart-health/">heart-healthy</a>" diets, but the guidance seems to always change. It's confusing to me. What foods are important, and what should we avoid?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;One of the most important factors for a healthy heart is to try to follow a healthy diet. We usually recommend a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>, which is mostly based on trying to eat more white meat, such as fish and chicken, instead of red meat, such as beef or pork. This type of diet also focuses on eating more vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, beans, whole grains and olive oil.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies have shown that people living in Mediterranean countries, such as Italy and Greece, are less likely to die of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118">heart disease</a>.&amp;nbsp;The World Health Organization recognizes the Mediterranean diet as a healthy eating pattern. Many nutrition experts in the U.S. recommend it and it is important to follow the diet long term in order to see heart benefits.</p>



<p>Cutting out&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114">trans fats</a>&amp;nbsp;in fried food, frozen pizza and microwave popcorn, and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-not-so-sweet-truth-of-added-sugars">added sugar</a>&amp;nbsp;in soda, sweets and pastries is also important for your heart health. Switching your snacks, especially before or after exercising, from cookies or chocolates to carrots or broccoli, can help you continue to snack but with beneficial ingredients. Staying hydrated helps your heart pump blood more effectively and benefits your blood vessels and muscles. Drink at least 2 liters of water each day.</p>



<p>Avoiding tobacco and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551">alcohol consumption</a>&amp;nbsp;are important factors to prevent future cardiovascular conditions. It has been shown that after just one year of quitting tobacco use, your risk of having a cardiovascular event drops in half in comparison with patients who smoke tobacco. That's how big the impact of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584">quitting tobacco</a>&amp;nbsp;use is on your heart, and it's never too late to stop. Alcohol use can trigger difficulty for you to fall asleep, and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20354018">sleep disorders</a>&amp;nbsp;have been linked to heart disease. Incorporating these healthy habits will make you more likely to have refreshed sleep.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Following diet trends such as making the switch to strictly plant-based or vegan or going gluten- or lactose-free is individual to each person because patients may have an intolerance to this type of food or its components. In general, low-sugar, low-salt and low-carb diets are usually helpful for all our patients to stay out of cardiovascular risk.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you can avoid some medical conditions in the future such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">hypertension</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">diabetes</a> and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">high cholesterol</a>. These conditions increase your risk of having a cardiovascular event such as a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106">heart attack</a>&amp;nbsp;or a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113">stroke</a>. One of my best tips is to start adjusting your lifestyle little by little but consistently, taking baby steps&amp;nbsp;— even if you adjust just one factor per day or per week, whether that's trying to cut down on the amount of high sugar, high fat or high salt in your diet. Little by little and with time, those changes will remain and will help you prevent any type of long-term medical condition in the future.&amp;nbsp;<em>—&amp;nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cardenas-rosales-juan-c-m-d/bio-20526630"><strong><em>Juan Cardenas Rosales, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I'm 52 years old and enjoy long walks with my husband and our dog. I recently started to experience pain in my left calf during our walks. The leg pain goes away when I rest. Because I have a history of high blood pressure, I went to see my primary care physician and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. What is this condition, and what treatments are available? Will I need surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-peripheral-artery-disease-diagnosed/">Peripheral artery disease</a>&nbsp;is a common, chronic medical condition that affects circulation in the body due to narrowed arteries. The narrowing of arteries is caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, which reduces blood flow from the heart to different regions of the body. This can affect the arms, but most commonly, it is an issue found in the legs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of peripheral artery disease" class="wp-image-348220" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>The risk of developing peripheral artery disease increases with age, particularly for those over 65 or after 50 if you have certain risk factors. Factors that can contribute to your risk include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">High blood pressure</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">High cholesterol</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">Diabetes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521">Chronic kidney disease</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">Obesity</a>&nbsp;(a body mass index over 30)</li>



<li>Smoking tobacco/using tobacco products</li>
</ul>



<p>Many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, while others experience leg pain when walking or even at rest. The severity of your symptoms and the extent of the blockage are used to categorize the stage of your peripheral artery disease and inform specific treatment options.</p>



<p>There are two stages of peripheral artery disease. The early stage is called&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/claudication/symptoms-causes/syc-20370952">claudication</a>, when people experience pain when walking or engaging in activity. In this stage, the pain begins during exercise and ends with rest. It is usually felt in the calves, thighs and buttocks.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The advanced, severe stage of peripheral artery disease is called critical limb threatening ischemia. During this stage, pain is often felt in the feet, even without walking, and is worse during rest or when lying down. You also may experience open sores or wounds on your limbs or feet that won't heal. Critical limb threatening ischemia may cause tissue death or gangrene on your feet. If this goes untreated, it can lead to leg amputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350563">Treatment</a>&amp;nbsp;for peripheral artery disease varies depending on its severity. When it's diagnosed early, lifestyle changes and treatment of underlying medical conditions are often enough to manage symptoms. This may mean taking appropriate medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol, controlling blood sugar levels if you have diabetes, quitting smoking, eating a healthier diet with fewer fatty and highly processed foods, and regular exercise or engaging in a walking program.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For more advanced disease, restoration of blood flow is necessary in addition to lifestyle changes. Therefore, the goal of surgery is to restore blood flow and prevent leg amputation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>One treatment option is percutaneous endovascular surgery, a minimally invasive approach. In this operation, the surgeon guides a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the groin, foot or wrist to the narrowed part of the artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow. A stent, a small wire mesh tube, may also be placed in the artery to keep it open.</p>



<p>The more invasive surgical option is bypass surgery. The surgeon creates a path around the blocked artery using either a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic one. One end of the healthy vein is connected to the artery above the blockage, and the other is attached below the blockage so that the blood will detour into the bypass.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>When diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, it’s important to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/vascular-and-endovascular-surgery/overview/ovc-20458819">consult a vascular surgeon</a>&amp;nbsp;to determine the best treatment for you. Vascular surgeons can perform both minimally invasive procedures and complex bypass surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>By incorporating lifestyle changes and treating any underlying medical conditions early, you can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent progression to more severe stages of disease. Peripheral artery disease is a marker for your overall cardiovascular health, and managing it correctly can lead to a longer, healthier life. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shuja-fahad-m-b-b-s/bio-20323775"><strong><em>Fahad Shuja, M.B.B.S.,</em></strong></a><strong><em>&amp;nbsp;Vascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39503653/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20A%20history%20of%20HDP,addition%20to%20traditional%20risk%20factors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new study</a> has revealed a significant link between a common pregnancy complication and early heart disease in women.</p>



<p>Researchers found that women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) were at higher risk of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a> at an earlier age. In addition, they found that women with these disorders were at higher risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cardiovascular-diseases/news/advancing-the-understanding-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-artery-disease-minoca/mac-20574642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA</a>) — heart attacks that occur when the coronary arteries appear normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) — such as gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension and preeclampsia — affect 15% of women during their reproductive years. Marked by high blood pressure, the effects of these disorders continue to impact the health of mothers and babies well after pregnancy.</p>



<p>Compared to women with a history of normotensive (normal blood pressure) pregnancies, women in this study with a history of HDP were at greater risk for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Early onset of coronary artery disease: Occurring on average seven years earlier among women with a history of HDP.</li>



<li>More severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease: Twice as likely among women with a history of HDP.</li>



<li>Increased risk of MINOCA: Twice as likely among women with a history of HDP.</li>
</ul>

<p>"This research highlights the need for earlier screening for heart disease among women with a history of high blood pressure in pregnancy, particularly for MINOCA, which is up to five times more common in women than in men," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/garovic-vesna-d-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vesna Garovic, M.D., Ph.D</a>., a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>To improve patient care and outcomes for women, the researchers say clinicians should not only screen for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors, but they should also screen for non-traditional risk factors associated with MINOCA and other non-obstructive types of coronary artery disease, such as stress, autoimmune diseases — and now, HDP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does high blood pressure in pregnancy lead to coronary artery disease?</strong></h2>



<p>According to the researchers, there are two related types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-vessel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small vessel heart disease</a> that may make it more likely for women to develop HDP and coronary artery disease:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Microvascular dysfunction: Women with a history of HDP often have this underlying problem, which occurs when the small blood vessels that feed the heart stop working as they should, decreasing blood flow to the heart.</li>



<li>Endothelial dysfunction: This is a problem common to both HDP and coronary artery disease. It occurs when the cells that line the inside of blood vessels malfunction, narrowing instead of dilating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Together, these dysfunctions clog or narrow the arteries and small blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, which can lead to coronary artery disease without any physical blockage (non-obstructive). The researchers think it's possible that these processes may feed on one another, creating an environment where coronary artery disease is more likely to occur.</p>



<p>Further research, including large prospective studies, are needed to understand the mechanisms linking HDP to coronary artery disease, such as specific biomarkers and genetic factors that contribute to increased risk.</p>



<p>Read the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39503653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> to learn more about the study, including funding and disclosures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A growing body of research on high blood pressure in pregnancy</strong></h2>



<p>Research led by Dr. Garovic, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist, has shown links between HDP and a greater risk for a wide range of health concerns including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(17)30437-8/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atherosclerosis</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20087214/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a></li>

</ul>



<p>The overall goal of Dr. Garovic's research is to increase understanding of the causes and mechanisms that play a role in the process that leads to HDP. The potential to identify targeted therapies that address the underlying causes of disease may improve treatment options for diseases, such as preeclampsia, that have seen few therapeutic advances in recent decades.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>



<p>"We think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disease research. We hope to save time and resources and avoid the development of therapies that fail upon translation into patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, who leads the Translational Neuroimmunology Lab.&amp;nbsp;"Understanding which treatments show potential for success in human organoids could dramatically accelerate the rate of new therapies for patients with unmet needs."</p>

<p>Early detection improves treatment outcomes for endometrial and ovarian cancers, yet far too often, women are diagnosed when in advanced stages of these diseases.

The research analysis by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-00092417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abba Zubair, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a laboratory medicine expert and medical director for the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Florida, and Fay Abdul Ghani, Mayo Clinic research technologist, finds microgravity can strengthen the regenerative potential of cells.&amp;nbsp;<br><br>"Studying stem cells in space has uncovered cell mechanisms that would otherwise be undetected or unknown within the presence of normal gravity," says Dr. Zubair. "That discovery indicates a broader scientific value to this research, including potential clinical applications."</p>

<p>The holiday season is a time of celebration and excess, but Mayo Clinic experts say too much salt, caffeine and alcohol can lead to a little-known condition called "holiday heart" that can have significant consequences.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pollak-amy-w-m-d/bio-20095583?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amy Pollak,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains how "holiday heart" can put too much stress on the heart.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/VNtgtHxQ_d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/12/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Recognizing-holiday-heart_CLEAN.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:00) is in the downloads&amp;nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/12/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Recognizing-Holiday-Heart-Script.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Holiday heart" may sound like another joyous part of the holiday season.</p>



<p>"But, in the cardiology world, 'holiday heart' actually refers to this effect of the stress of too much alcohol, too much salt, higher blood pressure on the heart," says Dr. Pollak.</p>



<p>Dr. Pollak says all that stress on the heart can cause an irregular heartbeat known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/12/Atrial-fibrillation-Mayo-16-x-9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Atrial fibrillation can lead to the development of blood clots in the heart that can break off, travel to and block arteries supplying the brain with blood.

This can result in the most common type of stroke (ischemic stroke).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"And, for some people, it feels like their heart is racing out of their chest," she says. "Their heart is just beating vigorously. For other folks, they just feel some irregularity – tired, short of breath, just wiped out, no energy."</p>



<p>Atrial fibrillation can lead to a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>.</p>



<p>"So atrial fibrillation is something that is serious," Dr. Pollak says. "And, so, if you do feel that your heart is racing around the holidays, and it's not just from seeing someone underneath the mistletoe, but your heart is racing from irregularity, or you're feeling short of breath, any type of chest discomfort, overly fatigued, you really need to seek medical attention."</p>



<p>Dr. Pollak says the best way to avoid "holiday heart" is to avoid the excesses that are so prevalent during the holidays. She says that doesn't mean you have to skip a holiday party. Just skip some of the booze, cups of coffee and adding salt on your food.</p>

<p><em>Clinicians at Mayo Clinic can use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to effectively screen patients for a weak heart pump via a simple electrocardiogram (ECG). A new study addresses the next question: Is it good value for the money spent?&amp;nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. &amp;nbsp;— <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/trial-demonstrates-early-ai-guided-detection-of-heart-disease-in-routine-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier research</a> showed that primary care clinicians using AI-ECG tools identified more unknown cases of a weak heart pump, also called low ejection fraction, than without AI. New <a href="https://www.mcpdigitalhealth.org/article/S2949-7612(24)00104-4/fulltext#keywords-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study findings</a> published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health suggest that this type of screening is also cost-effective in the long term, especially in outpatient settings.</p>



<p>Incremental <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drops in heart function</a> are treatable with medication but can be hard to spot. Patients may or may not have symptoms when their heart is not pumping effectively, and doctors may not order an echocardiogram or other diagnostic test to check <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ejection fraction</a> unless there are symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/noseworthy-peter-a-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20094212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Noseworthy, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and co-author of the study, notes that using AI to catch the hidden signals of heart failure during a routine visit can mean earlier treatment for patients, delaying or stopping disease progression, and fewer related medical costs over time.</p>



<p>According to the study, the cost-effectiveness ratio of using AI-ECG was $27,858 per quality-adjusted life year — a measure of the quality of life and years lived. The program was especially cost-effective in outpatient settings, with a much lower cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,651 per quality-adjusted life year.</p>



<p>The researchers studied the economic impact of using the AI-ECG tool by using real-world information from 22,000 participants in the established <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01335-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EAGLE trial</a> and following which patients had weak heart pumps and which did not. They simulated the progression of disease in the longer term, assigning values for the health burden on patients and the resulting effect on economic value.</p>



<p>"We categorized patients as either AI-ECG positive, meaning we would recommend further testing for low ejection fraction, or AI-ECG negative with no further tests needed. Then we followed the normal path of care and looked at what that would cost. Did they have an echocardiogram? Did they stay healthy or develop heart failure later and need hospitalization? We considered different scenarios, costs and patient outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/yao-xiaoxi-ph-d-m-p-h/bio-20382281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiaoxi Yao, Ph.D.</a>, a professor of Health Services Research at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Dr. Yao, who is the senior author of the study, notes that cost-effectiveness is an important aspect of the evaluation of AI technologies when considering what to implement in clinical practice.</p>



<p>"We know that earlier diagnosis can lead to better and more cost-effective treatment options. To get there, we have been establishing a framework for AI evaluation and implementation. The next step is finding ways to streamline this process so we can reduce the time and resources required for such rigorous evaluation," says Dr. Yao.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;What is the difference between sudden <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-cardiac-arrest/">cardiac arrest</a> and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721">heart attack</a>? Who is at risk for both, and what safety measures can we take?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Sudden cardiac arrest may occur in various conditions when someone, while active (playing basketball or walking with friends), collapses and passes out. Their blood pressure drops, and often their heart stops. This may be caused by a lethal arrhythmia, which is when the heart beats abnormally and does not efficiently pump anymore. If your heart is not pumping, blood is not getting to the brain, and that's what causes the collapse.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>A&amp;nbsp;heart attack occurs when there is a blockage, and your heart muscle is deprived of blood flow. People experience chest pains or difficulty breathing. A heart attack can sometimes cause a sudden cardiac arrest and even induce a lethal arrhythmia due to irritation from lack of oxygen and blood flow. Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia occur when the heart is beating too fast, and it becomes dangerous. This also causes a lack of blood flow to your brain and vital organs since your heart is not pumping efficiently.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If someone is in cardiac arrest and you witness it, call 911. When calling for help, ask for an&amp;nbsp;automated external&amp;nbsp;defibrillator (AED) immediately. If the situation is safe to do so, perform CPR or chest compressions. If nearby, use a defibrillator on the person's chest. If an abnormal, dangerous beat is detected, the machine will appropriately shock the patient out of that rhythm. The defibrillator will give you a prompt so that if you've never done it before, you're not a medical professional or you're nervous, you can follow the instructions and it will tell you exactly what to do.</p>



<p>The overall population of those who are going to get sudden cardiac arrest is very small, but it changes based on your age and underlying medical conditions. Under 35, it is much more common to occur from an underlying&amp;nbsp;cardiomyopathy (abnormal heart muscle). The most common type is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle is thickened in regions and is more prone to arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). The risk of this is 1 in 500. This is what can cause abnormal heartbeat in young athletes in high school and college.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 35,&amp;nbsp;the concern switches to coronary artery disease and heart attack risk. Issues can arise&amp;nbsp;with the heart arteries because of hypertension, family history, diabetes, tobacco use and other risk factors that may cause cholesterol-rich plaques in your heart arteries. If that plaque ruptures, there is no blood flow to the muscle, and the muscle goes into abnormal heartbeats.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>People who do not exercise often and live a sedentary life can have sudden cardiac arrest. On the flip side, athletes such as triathletes and marathon runners put a large amount of pressure on their hearts. These patients are looked at more carefully. Family history of sudden cardiac arrest is an important consideration during physical examination. Exercise is critically important, not just for your overall mortality but also your mental well-being — the question is how to do it safely and who is at higher risk.</p>



<p>A 65-year-old who has been running marathons their whole life but has had open-heart surgery for coronary artery disease can continue running safely by keeping speed and capacity at a much lower heart rate. We talk to patients about how to do that. During a physical exam, doctors listen for unusual murmurs and conduct an&amp;nbsp;electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG)&amp;nbsp;and chest X-rays in case cardiomyopathy can be detected. Cardiopulmonary stress testing also can be performed, where a special mask is put on the face to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide. This aids healthcare teams in picking up very subtle irregularities that may signal a heart or lung abnormality.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Exercise plans are then tailored accordingly, but be sure to monitor your symptoms. If you have difficulty breathing during minimal exercise or tightness in the chest, dizziness or passing out spells, these things are concerning and warrant further testing. You can get back to exercising and doing the things you enjoy again — whether that's running a 5K or playing softball with your kids — the goal is to always do so safely.&amp;nbsp;<em>—</em>&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shapiro-brian-p-m-d-m-a/bio-20055339"><strong><em>Brian Shapiro, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine,&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong><em></em></p>

<p>"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is an adage that Mayo Clinic cardiologist Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez says remains true today.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease."</p><cite>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>And prevention, he says, can start small by focusing on the simple things, like&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-8-heart-healthy-diet-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a>&amp;nbsp;and exercise.</p>



<p>"Trying to eat healthier a little bit at a time, to move around through the day, avoiding sitting for too long," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>A positive outlook also can go far in your physical well-being. Enjoy a walk with a friend, for instance.</p>



<p>"Trying to find purpose every day, and trying to give love every day, because those are some of the emotional things that we don't take care of (that) also affect the heart," he says.</p>



<p>And finally, he says if you are prescribed medication for high&amp;nbsp;blood pressure or high&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, avoid the risk of a heart attack and follow your doctor's orders.</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers and be sure that all those factors are well under control," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>
