<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;We hear a lot about "<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-navigating-nutrition-for-heart-health/">heart-healthy</a>" diets, but the guidance seems to always change. It's confusing to me. What foods are important, and what should we avoid?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;One of the most important factors for a healthy heart is to try to follow a healthy diet. We usually recommend a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>, which is mostly based on trying to eat more white meat, such as fish and chicken, instead of red meat, such as beef or pork. This type of diet also focuses on eating more vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes, beans, whole grains and olive oil.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies have shown that people living in Mediterranean countries, such as Italy and Greece, are less likely to die of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118">heart disease</a>.&nbsp;The World Health Organization recognizes the Mediterranean diet as a healthy eating pattern. Many nutrition experts in the U.S. recommend it and it is important to follow the diet long term in order to see heart benefits.</p>



<p>Cutting out&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/trans-fat/art-20046114">trans fats</a>&nbsp;in fried food, frozen pizza and microwave popcorn, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-not-so-sweet-truth-of-added-sugars">added sugar</a>&nbsp;in soda, sweets and pastries is also important for your heart health. Switching your snacks, especially before or after exercising, from cookies or chocolates to carrots or broccoli, can help you continue to snack but with beneficial ingredients. Staying hydrated helps your heart pump blood more effectively and benefits your blood vessels and muscles. Drink at least 2 liters of water each day.</p>



<p>Avoiding tobacco and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/alcohol/art-20044551">alcohol consumption</a>&nbsp;are important factors to prevent future cardiovascular conditions. It has been shown that after just one year of quitting tobacco use, your risk of having a cardiovascular event drops in half in comparison with patients who smoke tobacco. That's how big the impact of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584">quitting tobacco</a>&nbsp;use is on your heart, and it's never too late to stop. Alcohol use can trigger difficulty for you to fall asleep, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-disorders/symptoms-causes/syc-20354018">sleep disorders</a>&nbsp;have been linked to heart disease. Incorporating these healthy habits will make you more likely to have refreshed sleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Following diet trends such as making the switch to strictly plant-based or vegan or going gluten- or lactose-free is individual to each person because patients may have an intolerance to this type of food or its components. In general, low-sugar, low-salt and low-carb diets are usually helpful for all our patients to stay out of cardiovascular risk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By maintaining a healthy lifestyle, you can avoid some medical conditions in the future such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">hypertension</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">diabetes</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">high cholesterol</a>. These conditions increase your risk of having a cardiovascular event such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106">heart attack</a>&nbsp;or a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113">stroke</a>. One of my best tips is to start adjusting your lifestyle little by little but consistently, taking baby steps&nbsp;— even if you adjust just one factor per day or per week, whether that's trying to cut down on the amount of high sugar, high fat or high salt in your diet. Little by little and with time, those changes will remain and will help you prevent any type of long-term medical condition in the future.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cardenas-rosales-juan-c-m-d/bio-20526630"><strong><em>Juan Cardenas Rosales, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I'm 52 years old and enjoy long walks with my husband and our dog. I recently started to experience pain in my left calf during our walks. The leg pain goes away when I rest. Because I have a history of high blood pressure, I went to see my primary care physician and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. What is this condition, and what treatments are available? Will I need surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-peripheral-artery-disease-diagnosed/">Peripheral artery disease</a>&nbsp;is a common, chronic medical condition that affects circulation in the body due to narrowed arteries. The narrowing of arteries is caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, which reduces blood flow from the heart to different regions of the body. This can affect the arms, but most commonly, it is an issue found in the legs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of peripheral artery disease" class="wp-image-348220" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>The risk of developing peripheral artery disease increases with age, particularly for those over 65 or after 50 if you have certain risk factors. Factors that can contribute to your risk include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">High blood pressure</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">High cholesterol</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">Diabetes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521">Chronic kidney disease</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">Obesity</a>&nbsp;(a body mass index over 30)</li>



<li>Smoking tobacco/using tobacco products</li>
</ul>



<p>Many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, while others experience leg pain when walking or even at rest. The severity of your symptoms and the extent of the blockage are used to categorize the stage of your peripheral artery disease and inform specific treatment options.</p>



<p>There are two stages of peripheral artery disease. The early stage is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/claudication/symptoms-causes/syc-20370952">claudication</a>, when people experience pain when walking or engaging in activity. In this stage, the pain begins during exercise and ends with rest. It is usually felt in the calves, thighs and buttocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advanced, severe stage of peripheral artery disease is called critical limb threatening ischemia. During this stage, pain is often felt in the feet, even without walking, and is worse during rest or when lying down. You also may experience open sores or wounds on your limbs or feet that won't heal. Critical limb threatening ischemia may cause tissue death or gangrene on your feet. If this goes untreated, it can lead to leg amputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350563">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for peripheral artery disease varies depending on its severity. When it's diagnosed early, lifestyle changes and treatment of underlying medical conditions are often enough to manage symptoms. This may mean taking appropriate medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol, controlling blood sugar levels if you have diabetes, quitting smoking, eating a healthier diet with fewer fatty and highly processed foods, and regular exercise or engaging in a walking program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more advanced disease, restoration of blood flow is necessary in addition to lifestyle changes. Therefore, the goal of surgery is to restore blood flow and prevent leg amputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One treatment option is percutaneous endovascular surgery, a minimally invasive approach. In this operation, the surgeon guides a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the groin, foot or wrist to the narrowed part of the artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow. A stent, a small wire mesh tube, may also be placed in the artery to keep it open.</p>



<p>The more invasive surgical option is bypass surgery. The surgeon creates a path around the blocked artery using either a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic one. One end of the healthy vein is connected to the artery above the blockage, and the other is attached below the blockage so that the blood will detour into the bypass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, it’s important to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/vascular-and-endovascular-surgery/overview/ovc-20458819">consult a vascular surgeon</a>&nbsp;to determine the best treatment for you. Vascular surgeons can perform both minimally invasive procedures and complex bypass surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By incorporating lifestyle changes and treating any underlying medical conditions early, you can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent progression to more severe stages of disease. Peripheral artery disease is a marker for your overall cardiovascular health, and managing it correctly can lead to a longer, healthier life. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shuja-fahad-m-b-b-s/bio-20323775"><strong><em>Fahad Shuja, M.B.B.S.,</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;Vascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>"This research highlights the need for earlier screening for heart disease among women with a history of high blood pressure in pregnancy, particularly for MINOCA, which is up to five times more common in women than in men," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/garovic-vesna-d-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vesna Garovic, M.D., Ph.D</a>., a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>To improve patient care and outcomes for women, the researchers say clinicians should not only screen for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors, but they should also screen for non-traditional risk factors associated with MINOCA and other non-obstructive types of coronary artery disease, such as stress, autoimmune diseases — and now, HDP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does high blood pressure in pregnancy lead to coronary artery disease?</strong></h2>



<p>According to the researchers, there are two related types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-vessel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small vessel heart disease</a> that may make it more likely for women to develop HDP and coronary artery disease:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Microvascular dysfunction: Women with a history of HDP often have this underlying problem, which occurs when the small blood vessels that feed the heart stop working as they should, decreasing blood flow to the heart.</li>



<li>Endothelial dysfunction: This is a problem common to both HDP and coronary artery disease. It occurs when the cells that line the inside of blood vessels malfunction, narrowing instead of dilating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Together, these dysfunctions clog or narrow the arteries and small blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, which can lead to coronary artery disease without any physical blockage (non-obstructive). The researchers think it's possible that these processes may feed on one another, creating an environment where coronary artery disease is more likely to occur.</p>



<p>Further research, including large prospective studies, are needed to understand the mechanisms linking HDP to coronary artery disease, such as specific biomarkers and genetic factors that contribute to increased risk.</p>



<p>Read the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39503653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> to learn more about the study, including funding and disclosures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A growing body of research on high blood pressure in pregnancy</strong></h2>



<p>Research led by Dr. Garovic, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist, has shown links between HDP and a greater risk for a wide range of health concerns including:</p>

</ul>



<p>The overall goal of Dr. Garovic's research is to increase understanding of the causes and mechanisms that play a role in the process that leads to HDP. The potential to identify targeted therapies that address the underlying causes of disease may improve treatment options for diseases, such as preeclampsia, that have seen few therapeutic advances in recent decades.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>



<p>"We think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disease research. We hope to save time and resources and avoid the development of therapies that fail upon translation into patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, who leads the Translational Neuroimmunology Lab.&nbsp;"Understanding which treatments show potential for success in human organoids could dramatically accelerate the rate of new therapies for patients with unmet needs."</p>

<p>Early detection improves treatment outcomes for endometrial and ovarian cancers, yet far too often, women are diagnosed when in advanced stages of these diseases. Unlike many other cancers, there are no standard screenings for early detection of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Mayo Clinic researchers have uncovered specific microbial signatures linked to endometrial and ovarian cancers, and they are working toward developing innovative home swab tests for women to assess their susceptibility.<br><br>"This research not only brings us closer to understanding the microbial dynamics in cancer, but also holds the potential to transform early detection and treatment strategies to positively impact women's health globally," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>, an assistant professor of surgery leading this research.</p>

<p>People who experience chronic exposure to racism may be affected by factors such as intergenerational trauma, reduced access to healthcare, differential treatment in healthcare settings and psychological distress. These negatively affect heart health and can have a cumulative effect throughout a person's life. Researchers from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota published a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/c2dream-framework-investigating-the-structural-mechanisms-undergirding-racial-health-inequities/76ADDAD3F3EEFCBA9E56123E56CB026A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;which provides a new framework describing how racism affects heart health among people of color in Minnesota. The researchers are focused on reversing these disparities.<br><br>"This framework will help scientists explore and measure how chronic exposure to racism, not race, influences health outcomes," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/phelan-sean-ph-d/bio-20035285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Phelan, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic health services researcher. "This will help enable researchers to design interventions that address the root causes of these disparities and improve heart health for people of color everywhere."</p>

<p>A team of six surgeons and 20 support staff combined expertise from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/doctors/drc-20424100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Transplantation</a>&nbsp;in an extraordinary 21-hour operation at Mayo Clinic. The team transplanted a donor larynx to a 59-year-old patient with cancer whose damaged larynx hampered his ability to talk, swallow and breathe. This groundbreaking surgery was only the third larynx transplant in the U.S., and the world's first known successful total larynx transplant performed in a patient with an active cancer as part of a clinical trial.<br><br>"All transplants are complex, but there are more tissue types and moving parts with laryngeal transplantation than other transplants," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, lead surgeon.&nbsp;"Mayo Clinic's team science approach made it possible for us to offer this type of transplant on a scale that was previously unattainable."</p>

<p-->The holiday season is a time of celebration and excess, but Mayo Clinic experts say too much salt, caffeine and alcohol can lead to a little-known condition called "holiday heart" that can have significant consequences.<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/pollak-amy-w-m-d/bio-20095583?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Amy Pollak,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, explains how "holiday heart" can put too much stress on the heart.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:00) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/12/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Recognizing-Holiday-Heart-Script.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"Holiday heart" may sound like another joyous part of the holiday season.</p>



<p>"But, in the cardiology world, 'holiday heart' actually refers to this effect of the stress of too much alcohol, too much salt, higher blood pressure on the heart," says Dr. Pollak.</p>



<p>Dr. Pollak says all that stress on the heart can cause an irregular heartbeat known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>.</p>

This can result in the most common type of stroke (ischemic stroke).</figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"And, for some people, it feels like their heart is racing out of their chest," she says. "Their heart is just beating vigorously. For other folks, they just feel some irregularity – tired, short of breath, just wiped out, no energy."</p>



<p>Atrial fibrillation can lead to a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>.</p>



<p>"So atrial fibrillation is something that is serious," Dr. Pollak says. "And, so, if you do feel that your heart is racing around the holidays, and it's not just from seeing someone underneath the mistletoe, but your heart is racing from irregularity, or you're feeling short of breath, any type of chest discomfort, overly fatigued, you really need to seek medical attention."</p>



<p>Dr. Pollak says the best way to avoid "holiday heart" is to avoid the excesses that are so prevalent during the holidays. She says that doesn't mean you have to skip a holiday party. Just skip some of the booze, cups of coffee and adding salt on your food.</p>

<p><em>Clinicians at Mayo Clinic can use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to effectively screen patients for a weak heart pump via a simple electrocardiogram (ECG). A new study addresses the next question: Is it good value for the money spent?&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. &nbsp;— <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/trial-demonstrates-early-ai-guided-detection-of-heart-disease-in-routine-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier research</a> showed that primary care clinicians using AI-ECG tools identified more unknown cases of a weak heart pump, also called low ejection fraction, than without AI. New <a href="https://www.mcpdigitalhealth.org/article/S2949-7612(24)00104-4/fulltext#keywords-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study findings</a> published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health suggest that this type of screening is also cost-effective in the long term, especially in outpatient settings.</p>



<p>Incremental <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drops in heart function</a> are treatable with medication but can be hard to spot. Patients may or may not have symptoms when their heart is not pumping effectively, and doctors may not order an echocardiogram or other diagnostic test to check <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ejection fraction</a> unless there are symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/noseworthy-peter-a-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20094212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Noseworthy, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and co-author of the study, notes that using AI to catch the hidden signals of heart failure during a routine visit can mean earlier treatment for patients, delaying or stopping disease progression, and fewer related medical costs over time.</p>



<p>According to the study, the cost-effectiveness ratio of using AI-ECG was $27,858 per quality-adjusted life year — a measure of the quality of life and years lived. The program was especially cost-effective in outpatient settings, with a much lower cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,651 per quality-adjusted life year.</p>



<p>The researchers studied the economic impact of using the AI-ECG tool by using real-world information from 22,000 participants in the established <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01335-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EAGLE trial</a> and following which patients had weak heart pumps and which did not. They simulated the progression of disease in the longer term, assigning values for the health burden on patients and the resulting effect on economic value.</p>



<p>"We categorized patients as either AI-ECG positive, meaning we would recommend further testing for low ejection fraction, or AI-ECG negative with no further tests needed. Then we followed the normal path of care and looked at what that would cost. Did they have an echocardiogram? Did they stay healthy or develop heart failure later and need hospitalization? We considered different scenarios, costs and patient outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/yao-xiaoxi-ph-d-m-p-h/bio-20382281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiaoxi Yao, Ph.D.</a>, a professor of Health Services Research at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Dr. Yao, who is the senior author of the study, notes that cost-effectiveness is an important aspect of the evaluation of AI technologies when considering what to implement in clinical practice.</p>



<p>"We know that earlier diagnosis can lead to better and more cost-effective treatment options. To get there, we have been establishing a framework for AI evaluation and implementation. The next step is finding ways to streamline this process so we can reduce the time and resources required for such rigorous evaluation," says Dr. Yao.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;What is the difference between sudden <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-cardiac-arrest/">cardiac arrest</a> and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">heart attack</a>? Who is at risk for both, and what safety measures can we take?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Sudden cardiac arrest may occur in various conditions when someone, while active (playing basketball or walking with friends), collapses and passes out. Their blood pressure drops, and often their heart stops. This may be caused by a lethal arrhythmia, which is when the heart beats abnormally and does not efficiently pump anymore. If your heart is not pumping, blood is not getting to the brain, and that's what causes the collapse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;heart attack occurs when there is a blockage, and your heart muscle is deprived of blood flow. People experience chest pains or difficulty breathing. A heart attack can sometimes cause a sudden cardiac arrest and even induce a lethal arrhythmia due to irritation from lack of oxygen and blood flow. Ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia occur when the heart is beating too fast, and it becomes dangerous. This also causes a lack of blood flow to your brain and vital organs since your heart is not pumping efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If someone is in cardiac arrest and you witness it, call 911. When calling for help, ask for an&nbsp;automated external&nbsp;defibrillator (AED) immediately. If the situation is safe to do so, perform CPR or chest compressions. If nearby, use a defibrillator on the person's chest. If an abnormal, dangerous beat is detected, the machine will appropriately shock the patient out of that rhythm. The defibrillator will give you a prompt so that if you've never done it before, you're not a medical professional or you're nervous, you can follow the instructions and it will tell you exactly what to do.</p>



<p>The overall population of those who are going to get sudden cardiac arrest is very small, but it changes based on your age and underlying medical conditions. Under 35, it is much more common to occur from an underlying&nbsp;cardiomyopathy (abnormal heart muscle). The most common type is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, where the heart muscle is thickened in regions and is more prone to arrhythmia (an irregular heartbeat). The risk of this is 1 in 500. This is what can cause abnormal heartbeat in young athletes in high school and college.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over 35,&nbsp;the concern switches to coronary artery disease and heart attack risk. Issues can arise&nbsp;with the heart arteries because of hypertension, family history, diabetes, tobacco use and other risk factors that may cause cholesterol-rich plaques in your heart arteries. If that plaque ruptures, there is no blood flow to the muscle, and the muscle goes into abnormal heartbeats.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People who do not exercise often and live a sedentary life can have sudden cardiac arrest. On the flip side, athletes such as triathletes and marathon runners put a large amount of pressure on their hearts. These patients are looked at more carefully. Family history of sudden cardiac arrest is an important consideration during physical examination. Exercise is critically important, not just for your overall mortality but also your mental well-being — the question is how to do it safely and who is at higher risk.</p>



<p>A 65-year-old who has been running marathons their whole life but has had open-heart surgery for coronary artery disease can continue running safely by keeping speed and capacity at a much lower heart rate. We talk to patients about how to do that. During a physical exam, doctors listen for unusual murmurs and conduct an&nbsp;electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG)&nbsp;and chest X-rays in case cardiomyopathy can be detected. Cardiopulmonary stress testing also can be performed, where a special mask is put on the face to measure oxygen and carbon dioxide. This aids healthcare teams in picking up very subtle irregularities that may signal a heart or lung abnormality.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Exercise plans are then tailored accordingly, but be sure to monitor your symptoms. If you have difficulty breathing during minimal exercise or tightness in the chest, dizziness or passing out spells, these things are concerning and warrant further testing. You can get back to exercising and doing the things you enjoy again — whether that's running a 5K or playing softball with your kids — the goal is to always do so safely.&nbsp;<em>—</em>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shapiro-brian-p-m-d-m-a/bio-20055339"><strong><em>Brian Shapiro, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine,&nbsp;Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong><em></em></p>

<p>"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure" is an adage that Mayo Clinic cardiologist Dr. Francisco Lopez-Jimenez says remains true today.</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-360607 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/02/Francisco-Lopez-Jimenez_lab-coat.jpg 1687w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"No matter how difficult prevention might look, it is way better than treating heart disease."</p><cite>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>And prevention, he says, can start small by focusing on the simple things, like&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-8-heart-healthy-diet-strategies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diet</a>&nbsp;and exercise.</p>



<p>"Trying to eat healthier a little bit at a time, to move around through the day, avoiding sitting for too long," says Dr. Lopez-Jimenez.</p>



<p>A positive outlook also can go far in your physical well-being. Enjoy a walk with a friend, for instance.</p>



<p>"Trying to find purpose every day, and trying to give love every day, because those are some of the emotional things that we don't take care of (that) also affect the heart," he says.</p>



<p>And finally, he says if you are prescribed medication for high&nbsp;blood pressure or high&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, avoid the risk of a heart attack and follow your doctor's orders.</p>



<p>"Take those medications, check your numbers and be sure that all those factors are well under control," Dr. Lopez-Jimenez says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Tips and strategies for a heart-healthy diet</h3>

<p><em><strong>Celebrating advancements of cardiac care&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>Sixty-five years after her open-heart surgery — a procedure that was pioneered in the U.S. just years before she needed it — Andree Jacob's heart is still ticking strong. She is a living testament to the importance of medical innovation and the lifetime of gratitude that comes with it.</p>



<p>When Andree, 72, from the Canadian province of Quebec, was a child, her mother noticed she caught colds easily and withdrew to rest often while playing. Her heart would beat rapidly, visible even through her clothes.</p>



<p>Concerned, her mother took her to the doctor multiple times and insisted on testing until a medical team in Montreal discovered Andree had atrial septal defect (ASD). This heart condition, a hole between the upper heart chambers, allows an increased amount of blood through the lungs. This defect may cause shortness of breath; tiredness; swelling of the legs, feet or belly area; and irregular heartbeats, skipped heartbeats, or feelings of a quick, pounding or fluttering heartbeat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The surgery that saved Andree's life</h2>



<p>In the fall of 1958, Andree was scheduled for heart surgery in Montreal, but the operation was postponed. Her father's cousin, Dr. Camille Dufault, an internist involved in research in Canada, arranged for her to have surgery at the renowned Mayo Clinic.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="565" height="318" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Andree_child_image_16x9.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397170" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Andree_child_image_16x9.jpg 565w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Andree_child_image_16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 565px) 100vw, 565px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Andree Jacob as a child</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In May 1959, at 7 years old, Andree and her father traveled to Rochester, Minnesota, for surgery.</p>



<p>"I remember the surgery day vividly. My father left me in the care of two nuns before the operation, and I felt abandoned when he didn't follow me into the operating room. I only spoke French at the time," recalls Andree.</p>



<p>Andree's father, a farmer, wrote letters to her mother for the 28 days Andree stayed at Mayo Clinic. He reassured his wife that Andree was doing well, while also reminding her to tend to the dairy cows, pigs and chickens.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A life full of gratitude and resilience</h2>



<p>Returning home in June 1959, Andree resumed life with a new vigor. She grew into an active adult who married her American husband in 1974. Together they built a beautiful life with their two daughters and their families. Other than a more recent medication for heart palpitations, her heart has remained healthy and strong.</p>



<p>"On this year's heart anniversary, the number 65 resonated deeply with me, reminding me of how far I've come and how fortunate I am," she recalls. "The courage my parents showed in pursuing the best possible care for me is something I will always honor. They placed their faith in a medical team across the border."</p>



<p>"I am overwhelmed by gratitude — for the skilled hands of the surgeons at Mayo Clinic, for my parents' unwavering support and for the beautiful life I have lived since. Every year, we reflect on the miracles and the love that have shaped our lives," she continues.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">History of cardiac innovation</h2>



<p>In the 1950s — the time of Andree's surgery — cardiac surgery was still developing. <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)63095-4/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. John W. Kirklin</a>, the Mayo Clinic surgeon who performed Andree's life-changing surgery, was a pioneer in modern-day cardiac care. As a young surgeon supported by a multidisciplinary team of physicians and technicians in Rochester, Dr. Kirklin envisioned using a mechanical pump-oxygenator to support the circulation while working inside the heart.</p>



<p>Dr. Kirklin’s persistence paid off in 1955 with the first successful use of the heart-lung machine at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"The only way to address structural abnormalities inside the heart, like ASD, was to stop the heart so you could go inside it. We needed a heart-lung machine to support the patient's bodily systems," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dearani-joseph-a-m-d/bio-20053326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Joseph Dearani</a>, cardiovascular surgeon at Mayo Clinic. "It was a revolution and paved the way for the whole future of cardiac surgery."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A flutter of innovation</h2>



<p>The first 50 years of cardiac surgery were marked by the introduction of new procedures, especially for congenital heart disease.</p>



<p>The next 50 years have brought many significant advances in cardiology and cardiac surgery:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Heart-lung machines with numerous safeguards and alarms to address issues immediately during surgery.</li>



<li>Cardiac catheterization labs (cath labs) with technology that allows doctors to access the heart through a peripheral vessel or another vein, avoiding open-heart surgery and enabling same-day discharge.</li>



<li>Sophisticated imaging techniques like echocardiography, CT scans and MRI that provide detailed road maps for surgery, allowing surgeons to create 3D models and practice operations on rare anomalies before entering the operating room.</li>



<li>Advanced anesthesia techniques that enable many patients to have their breathing tubes removed immediately after surgery, along with improved pain management protocols aimed at "painless heart surgery."</li>



<li>Robotic heart surgery, minimally invasive surgery and thoracoscopic surgery that use small incisions and cameras, resulting in shorter hospital stays, reduced pain and quicker recovery.</li>



<li>Advanced medications administered around the time of surgery to stabilize patients during the procedure and promote faster recovery.</li>



<li>More aggressive care plans that encourage patients to walk the halls with rehabilitation staff shortly after surgery, enhancing healing and enabling remarkable activity even the day after surgery.</li>



<li>Improved understanding of technologies that help experts enhance patient tolerance to surgery and speed recovery.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<p>"So many of the surgeries that we used to perform wouldn't require surgery now because we can treat the patients noninvasively in the cath lab," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-jonathan-n-m-d/bio-20055043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jonathan Johnson</a>, pediatric cardiologist and chair of the Division of Pediatric Cardiology at Mayo Clinic. "Now we routinely replace valves, insert stents — things that once required opening the chest. Many of those patients don't even have to stay overnight in the hospital."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's next: Transforming cardiac care</h2>



<p>As healthcare continues to evolve at an unprecedented rate, Mayo Clinic continues searching for ways to transform healthcare with artificial intelligence (AI), genetic screening and virtual tools.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Artificial intelligence: In the future, AI will transform how heart defects are detected and diagnosed from birth. AI will be integrated into handheld ultrasound devices and ECGs to help doctors and care teams record the heart's electrical activity more effectively across different healthcare settings and improve their accuracy. This means that signs of heart issues could be spotted much earlier, even when they're not obvious. AI also will support experts by picking up small irregularities on ECG that might suggest more complicated heart conditions, helping doctors better understand and treat heart issues early on.</li>



<li>Genetic screening: New genetic screening technologies will become a vital tool. Healthcare professionals will use genetic information to predict the risk of developing heart defects, providing crucial insights even before any symptoms appear. Collaborations with genetic researchers will refine these screenings, making them more accurate and helpful for predicting and managing heart health from earlier ages.</li>



<li>Advancement in cardiac surgery: Cardiac surgery is increasingly adopting more objective methods to assess and improve performance, focusing on communication and technical skills in the operating room. For example, Mayo Clinic, the University of Michigan, the University of Edinburgh in the U.K., and the United States Tennis Association recently received National Institutes of Health funding to use advanced video assessment techniques to analyze surgical skills in the operating room. This approach will allow surgeons to review their procedures alongside experienced colleagues, providing clearer insights into areas for improvement.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Some things never change</h2>



<p>Despite decades of medical innovation, the heart behind pediatric cardiac care at Mayo Clinic beats as strong as ever.</p>



<p>"Our team of professionals work together to do the best for each child’s situation," reflects Dr. Johnson. "It's a ballet of people working together at the same time to create this amazing performance. It's extremely humbling to be part of a field that saves and improves lives. Every day, this remarkable team has nothing but their patients on their minds — that's an incredible thing."</p>



<p>Andree couldn't agree more. "My story is not just about survival," she says. "It's about the extraordinary strength of family, the advancements in medicine and the kindness of those who care for others. It's a reminder that every day is a gift."</p>

<p></p>



<p>At 77, Dan Knapp prioritizes his health. "For the past twelve years, I've scheduled annual visits to monitor my conditions," says Knapp, a longtime patient at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eau Claire</a>, Wisconsin. "It gives me peace of mind, knowing I'm doing everything I can to stay ahead of any potential issues."</p>



<p>During these visits, Dan meets with his primary care team to discuss medication and lifestyle changes that may affect his well-being. The team also monitors his chronic conditions, which include diabetes and high blood pressure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why your blood pressure matters</h2>



<p>Having high blood pressure increases the risk of heart disease and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/who-is-most-at-risk-for-a-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, which are the leading causes of death in the U.S.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-numbers-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood pressure</a>&nbsp;measures how hard blood pushes against arteries as it moves through the body. Over time, elevated or high blood pressure makes the heart work harder and less efficiently. It can also damage the eyes, kidneys and blood vessels.</p>



<p>Blood pressure readings fall into four categories: Normal, elevated, hypertension stage 1 and hypertension stage 2. Knowing your blood pressure numbers is critical for maintaining or improving your health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increasing convenience with at-home monitoring</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/6-ways-to-manage-high-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Controlling high blood pressure</a>&nbsp;requires consistent effort from both patients and healthcare teams. Historically, this has involved in-person visits for regular monitoring.</p>



<p>However, for many people, especially those in rural areas, the inconvenience of these visits can be a barrier to effective care.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A home blood pressure monitoring program offers people more control and convenience when tracking their readings.</strong></h3>



<p>Based on recommendations from the American Medical Association and American Heart Association, people are educated on proper techniques for using their own blood pressure monitors at home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Monitors that allow upper arm blood pressure and ensure proper cuff size have the most accurate readings.</strong></h3>



<p>Readings can then be manually entered into the patient portal or through Bluetooth-enabled devices.</p>



<p>"Home blood pressure monitoring is a terrific option for our patients," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/christopher-roberts-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Roberts, M.D.</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/primary-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primary Care</a>&nbsp;physician in&nbsp;Eau Claire. "Mr. Knapp was motivated to get his blood pressure under control, which made him an excellent candidate for this program. It has saved him the cost and inconvenience of driving 80 miles to our clinic."</p>



<p>"The whole process is incredibly user-friendly — even for a non-tech savvy guy like me," Dan says. "Not all my readings are perfect, but when they're not, I know my care team will be on top of it."</p>



<p>If the blood pressure readings show concerning trends over time, your healthcare team can recommend lifestyle or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dietary changes</a>&nbsp;and make medication adjustments.</p>



<p>For Dan, this enhanced access has paid off. His most recent blood pressure was 125/69, a dramatic improvement from his starting point.</p>



<p>"Overall, I’m a healthier person because of this process," says Dan. "As I've gotten older, my health has become more important — you can't wait until things go wrong to fix them. I want to live a long time, and this is a way I can do that."</p>
