<p>It was the evening of April 4, 2024 on a concert stage in Gilbert, Arizona.</p>



<p>Colt Ford and his band were performing their signature blend of country, rap and hip-hop music. It was a sold-out crowd. Colt was feeling at the top of his game, and the concert was shaping up to be one of the band's best shows ever.</p>



<p>No one expected how this night would end.</p>

<p>"Like it was really clicking. We had just made some changes in the set and it was feeling really good. The vibe was good, it all felt good," remembers Colt. "My stage manager said 'That's the best show we've done this year, man, you killed it,' It was incredible."</p>



<p>At the end of the show Colt thanked fans, turned and exited the stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No one expected what happened minutes later</strong></h2>

<p>"I woke up seven or eight days later, whatever, and I woke up in the hospital and was like 'What's going on?' I had no concept of anything," says Colt. "When I played the show that night I could do anything but when I woke up in the hospital I couldn't pick up a cup with ice in it and feed it to myself."</p>



<p>Minutes after exiting the stage, Colt suffered a massive heart attack. He was found slumped over in a chair backstage by one of his fellow band members. Emergency crews responded immediately and Colt was rushed to the hospital.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"<strong>I couldn't have been anymore on death's door. I died twice that day.</strong>"</p><cite><strong>Colt Ford</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"When one of the top heart doctors in the world looks at you and goes 'You're 1% of 1%,' it can't get anymore dire than that," says Colt about his odds of surviving his heart attack.</p>



<p>Colt went into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634">arrest</a>&nbsp;twice.

"He would simply not have survived in most parts of the world that don't have access to such a high level of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiogenic-shock/symptoms-causes/syc-20366739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiogenic shock care</a>.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart disease</a>&nbsp;is the leading cause of death worldwide. One of the most common types of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118"> disease</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>. In the United States alone, it is estimated that every 40 seconds, someone has a heart attack.</p>



<p>Doctors often warn about the signs and symptoms of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain or pressure</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. However, roughly 21% of heart attacks in the U.S. occur with minimal or even no symptoms, according to the American Heart Association. These&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"silent" heart attacks</a>&nbsp;are known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent ischemia</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent myocardial infarction</a>.</p>



<p>Colt says he had recently undergone a regular check-up at a different medical center and got a clean bill of health.</p>



<p>"This is the unfortunate nature of heart attacks. It is possible to have tests which don't show&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockages</a>, but the nature of blockages is that they can behave unpredictably and suddenly occur," says Dr. Lee. "Despite our best efforts, on a populational level, heart attacks can still occur in patients out of the blue."</p>



<p>Nearly nine months after his heart attack, test results at Mayo Clinic indicate Colt is making excellent progress.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/fitness-basics/hlv-20049447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercise</a>&nbsp;combined with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20046702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy diet</a>&nbsp;has helped him shed 60 pounds. "I'm about back to being in my college shape," says Colt, who played on the golf team for the University of Georgia before his singing career took off.</p>

<p>While his physical health improves, Colt admits the health scare has left him battling&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panic attacks</a>. "For me to say I'm having anxiety and panic attacks, that's even hard for me to say because I ain't scared of nothing," Colt says. "But I'm having to deal with that and share my feelings and all that kind of stuff. So, if you're feeling something, advocate for yourself. Don't just tough it out. Tell somebody."</p>



<p>Dr. Lee says it is not uncommon for patients to experience anxiety, panic attacks and even depression following a heart attack. He recommends patients maintain an open dialogue with their health care team and discuss any issues that arise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>"I'm back, baby!</strong>"</h2>



<p>Colt has been open about sharing his experience with his nearly three million followers on social media. "I'm back, baby!" Colt shared recently on Instagram. "It's been quite a journey but you guys have inspired me, you kept loving me, kept praying for me, kept sending me messages and I'm working hard to get better."</p>



<p>Just a year shy of his heart attack, Colt has released a new song and is embarking on a new tour. He is hoping his music and story will serve as inspiration for others. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"Be happy that you're here and you're alive and you get a chance. I get a second chance and I want to do something positive with it.

<p-->Daylight Saving Time begins March 9 when clocks spring an hour forward early Sunday morning.<p></p>



<p>No matter if you need five hours of sleep or eight, the key is getting good, refreshing rest. According to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/somers-virend-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054093?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Virend Somers</a>, a cardiologist who specializes in sleep disorders, how much sleep a person needs varies from person to person.

<p>Different people need different amounts of sleep, and, on average, we can say most people need seven to eight hours," explains Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>He says to consider the quality of sleep, not the quantity. He offers these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379">ideas&nbsp;</a>to help you have good sleep hygiene.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for better sleep</h2>



<p>"In the bedroom, you want absolute darkness," says Dr. Somers.</p>

<p>And that means no screens, no TV, no laptops, no phones, and no ticking clocks or LED displays.</p>



<p>"Avoid bright lights, avoid looking at your phones because light from there can affect your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-melatonin/art-20363071">melatonin</a>," Dr. Somers says. That's the hormone that regulates sleep.</p>



<p>He says when it comes to quality sleep, less stimulation is best.</p>



<p>"Minimize alcohol, minimize exercise, minimize lights, minimize external inputs before about two hours or so before bedtime. The bedroom is for sex and sleep. It's not for spreadsheets," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>Exercise can help improve sleep, but working out near bedtime can raise arousal levels, making it harder to sleep. And consider a sleep schedule. Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.</p>

<p>The statistics are startling. One person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. High cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and hypertension can cause heart problems.</p>



<p>"African Americans, unfortunately, have the highest rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the world, which dramatically increases their risk for developing heart disease," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black Americans are disproportionately impacted by cardiovascular disease</h3>



<p>She says elevated hypertension rates in the Black community can be attributed to various factors, including chronic stress, systemic racism and socioeconomic issues.</p>



<p>"That includes food insecurity, housing insecurity, redlining, which really limits certain individuals from receiving opportunities and resources to better their health," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Dr. Brewer says simple lifestyle changes can reduce high blood pressure and heart disease, like eating healthier, getting regular physical activity and adequate sleep to reduce stress.</p>

<p>A new solution is transforming cardiac care by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in point-of-care ultrasound. This innovation enables a wider range of medical professionals to capture high-quality cardiac images with confidence, ultimately enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving clinical outcomes. Check out the latest episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodesix&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=global&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=190205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow's Cure</a> to learn more.</p>



<p>The podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/friedman-paul-a-m-d/bio-20053442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Paul Friedman</a>, cardiologist and chair of Cardiovascular Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and <a href="https://ultrasight.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Davidi Vortman</a>, CEO of UltraSight. Together, Mayo Clinic and UltraSight are at the forefront of developing algorithms to analyze and interpret cardiac ultrasound images. The collaboration seeks to create a comprehensive solution to support diagnostic and treatment decisions using point-of-care ultrasound devices.</p>



<p>This AI-driven technology is designed to overcome existing barriers and expand access to high-quality cardiac imaging and diagnostics. UltraSight's innovation simplifies cardiac sonography by providing real-time guidance on maneuvering the ultrasound probe to capture high-quality images. Now, with the added power of AI, healthcare professionals can analyze those images more effectively.</p>



<p>"Historically, ultrasound has been somewhat difficult for an average person to get," says Dr. Friedman. "So, in many places around the world, if a physician orders an ultrasound of the heart, an echocardiogram, it may take several months to be scheduled."</p>



<p>"It hasn't been used for first-line screening because of those barriers. This is where some of the visionary work of a portable device that uses AI can turn that upside," he adds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This innovative technology isn't about replacing experts, notes Vortman. "We're not replacing the experts, we are giving them more data from more patients, faster than ever before. So AI is an accelerator for access that gives much better data at the right time," he says.</p>



<p>"It doesn't replace human interpretation and action, but it can provide a common groundwork for consistency," Dr. Friedman adds.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Vortman envisions a future where diagnostic tools are more accessible and affordable. "This is the future. Diagnostic tools like ultrasound that are low-cost and can be used by a wider variety of healthcare team members are going to be future of healthcare and disease detection," he says.</p>



<p>The collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic and UltraSight holds the potential to democratize cardiac care, offering hope faster and more efficiently.

<p>"It's usually recommended for you to sleep at least seven hours per night in order to allow your body to recover to be ready for the following day," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical steps to help you get better sleep</strong></h2>



<p>"Try to sleep at the same time. Try to get a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and you're waking up also at the same time, that's very important," Dr. Cardenas Rosales says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create good sleep habits</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.</li>



<li>Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.</li>



<li>Limit naps or do not nap at all.</li>



<li>Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.</li>



<li>Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.</li>



<li>Make your bedroom comfortable.</li>



<li>Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You want to set up the environment to make it easier for your body to fall asleep," he says.</p>

The final step to establish the drug's long-term effectiveness and safety is a phase 3 trial, and efforts to launch that pivotal trial are soon to be underway with an industry partner.</p>

<p>In AVS, calcium deposits build up and narrow the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to move blood. The condition typically progresses over time, with symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue affecting people over age 65. The current standard of care — watchful waiting — often leads to reduced quality of life before the condition is severe enough for the patient to have a surgical or interventional <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valve replacement</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Miller-Jordan-D.-PhD_13024612_201905290903-250x300.jpg" alt="portrait of Dr. Jordan Miller" class="wp-image-400177" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Miller-Jordan-D.-PhD_13024612_201905290903-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Miller-Jordan-D.-PhD_13024612_201905290903.jpg 667w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This research represents a significant advancement in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cardiovascular-disease-aging/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardiovascular Disease and Aging Laboratory at Mayo Clinic</a>. &nbsp;"Ataciguat has the potential to substantially delay or even prevent the need for valve replacement surgery, significantly improving the lives of millions."</p>



<p>Dr. Miller notes that the impact extends beyond simply delaying surgery. Younger patients with aggressive disease or congenital valve defects may develop symptoms in midlife. If a patient requires valve replacement before the age of 55, there is a more than 50% likelihood they will require multiple valve replacement surgeries over their lifetime due to recalcification of the implanted valve. Ataciguat, which slowed progression of native aortic valve calcification in the clinical trial, offers the potential for a once-in-a-lifetime procedure if they can reach the age of 65. The older a patient is, the less likely the implanted valve is to calcify.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Mayo Clinic's research revealed that ataciguat reactivates a pathway crucial in preventing valvular calcification and stenosis. Preclinical studies in mice showed that this drug substantially slowed disease progression even when treatment began after the disease was established. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical trials in patients with moderate AVS demonstrated that once-daily ataciguat dosing was well tolerated, with minimal side effects compared to placebo. This latest phase 2 trial in 23 patients showed a 69.8% reduction in aortic valve calcification progression at six months compared to placebo, and patients receiving ataciguat tended to maintain better heart muscle function. Crucially, the research team confirmed that — despite its profound effect on slowing valve calcification — ataciguat did not negatively impact bone formation.</p>



<p>This important finding is the result of a collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Minnesota, and Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The research was conducted under an innovative academic-industry partnership grant administered by the National Center for Accelerating Translational Sciences and a Minnesota Biotechnology and Genomics Partnership grant.</p>

<p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition that causes the heart muscle to thicken, making it harder to pump blood and sometimes causing an irregular heart rhythm.</p>



<p>"So right now, what we think in the United States, we've only diagnosed 1/7 of the people who have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So we're trying to increase the awareness in the community about this disease," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says patients are born with a genetic mutation. The disease can start at a young age or later in life — many times with no symptoms.&nbsp; </p>



<p>"We know the patients that we lose to this condition, the majority of them are young, active and athletes. So high-level athletic exercise can put you at higher risk of sudden cardiac death," says Dr. Alsidawi.</p>



<p>He says it's important to seek medical attention if you have any symptoms, especially with exertion, "including shortness of breath, chest pain, lightheaded, dizzy or passing out."</p>



<p>If diagnosed, the good news is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can be treated with medications, surgery, implanting a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defibrillator</a> that monitors the heart or, in severe cases, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplantation</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Proton beam therapy is a form of radiation treatment that uses a precise beam of protons to deliver targeted radiation. Now, a clinical trial is exploring the use of proton beam therapy to treat ventricular tachycardia (VT).</p>



<p>"Ventricular tachycardia is a type of fast heart rhythm that we see in people who have almost any type of heart disease. It can be an old heart attack, heart valve surgery or cardiomyopathy, which is a group of diseases that affect the heart muscle," says Dr. Stevenson. "What's common to many of these things is that they'll produce an area of scar in the heart. If you have an area of scar in your pumping chambers, it's almost like having a little electrical circuit in that scar. When the right thing comes along to trigger it off, it goes each time around the circuit as a heartbeat, and it can cause episodes of sudden rapid heart action, which are ventricular tachycardia."</p>



<p>Treatment of VT aims at restoring normal heart rhythm and can include medication, use of a defibrillator and catheter ablation. Unlike catheter ablation, proton beam therapy is completely noninvasive and can be delivered directly to the target in the heart.</p>



<p>"The idea of targeting any-size lesion in the middle of the patient without having to put the patient under anesthesia or any sort of access to veins or chest cavity, sounds like it's right up our alley," says Dr. Deisher.</p>



<p>The clinical trial using proton beam therapy to treat VT offers promise for patients who continue to battle the condition despite previous treatments.</p>



<p>Dr. Siontis discusses the results of the study thus far, "I certainly think that there were some patients who benefited from radiation with protons when everything else that we did for them, including multiple catheter ablation procedures and medications, had failed. I think adding noninvasive options generates a broad spectrum of options for patients who have the most difficult arrhythmias."

<p><em>February is Heart Month in many countries</em></p>



<p>LONDON — You may have heard that people who feel faint should sit with their heads between their knees, but is that true? And how can you tell whether you or someone else who has fainted should go to the emergency department or perhaps even see a cardiologist? <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/doctors/elijah-r-behr-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elijah Behr, M.D.</a>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare</a>&nbsp;in London, explains five things it is important to know about fainting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-fainting/basics/art-20056606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fainting</a> or blacking out, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness due to insufficient blood flow to the brain. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are different types of syncope</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vasovagal syncope</a> is the medical term for the most benign kind of fainting, simple fainting without a serious underlying cause, Dr. Behr explains. This type of fainting is common.</p>



<p>"In some people, if they have a drop in blood pressure from emotional distress, pain, illness or dehydration, for example, or just generally have a low blood pressure, any provocation causes a reflex in the heart," Dr. Behr says. "Rather than the heart speeding up and pumping more forcefully to maintain the blood pressure, it starts to slow down. The blood pressure drops, the heart rate slows further, and the heart can pause for many seconds; sometimes close to a minute for some people who have more severe fainting episodes."</p>



<p>Usually with this type of fainting, the person falls to the floor, blood pressure returns to the brain and the person starts to recover. However, if someone faints in a vulnerable location or vulnerable position, it can be dangerous to that person and others, Dr. Behr notes.</p>



<p>The syncope that most concerns healthcare professionals is cardiac syncope, blacking out due to an underlying heart disease such as a heart rhythm abnormality, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/arrhythmia-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrhythmia</a>, he explains.</p>



<p>"This is usually a more abrupt loss and return of consciousness than in simple fainting. If you're older, you're more likely to have underlying <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a> that you may or may not be aware of. That's one of the reasons to be more concerned about loss of consciousness in older individuals," Dr. Behr says. "Young people can also have heart diseases that can cause cardiac syncope that may be a warning sign of something more serious to come, so it is important to investigate it."</p>



<p>Others for whom a blackout can be a warning sign of a serious heart problem include people with a family history of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inherited heart problems</a>, unexplained deaths or premature sudden deaths; people whose fainting is related to exercise; and people whose fainting is associated with heart palpitations or the heart feeling like it's racing away, he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before a simple faint, you might experience one or more signs that you should sit or lie down</h2>



<p>"There will be a sensation of lightheadedness. There may be a sensation of nausea or buzzing or ringing in the ears," Dr. Behr says. "Some people describe tunnel vision — their vision closing in on them before they actually pass out — and some may actually lose vision but still be aware, not lose consciousness completely, and then recover. Other typical signs include feeling sweaty and clammy."</p>



<p>Some people get about a half-hour of warnings before fainting; some people may get 30 seconds, he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do if you faint or someone else does:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Check that the person is breathing and has a pulse. If not, call for emergency help, and if you know how to provide <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-cpr/basics/art-20056600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a>, initiate it.</li>



<li>If the person is still breathing and has a pulse, ensure they are lying flat, and their airway is open using the recovery position and call for help.</li>



<li>If you feel like a faint may be coming on, position your head lower than your heart: for example, between the knees.</li>



<li>Rest after coming out of the faint.</li>



<li>Drink water after the faint, adding electrolytes if you have them.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If your blood pressure is getting low and you're getting those symptoms, it means the blood doesn't get into your brain, and if your heart is trying to push the blood to your brain against gravity, then it's struggling. You really need to get your head level or below your heart so the blood pressure gets back to the brain, and that will avert all the symptoms and the vicious cycle that ensues," Dr. Behr advises. "Get your head between your knees or lie down and put your head down and your feet up in the air, depending on where you are and what is feasible to do."</p>



<p>Getting up and walking around straight away is probably the worst thing to do, he warns.</p>



<p>"Your blood pressure will drop further, and you’ll feel worse, and collapse and fall and injure yourself," Dr. Behr says. "The best thing is to stay where you are and get flat, and when you're feeling better, drink some water, maybe with some electrolytes if you're dehydrated. For general preventive measures, we advise most people who have fainted to drink more water and to sometimes add a bit of salt to their food, because generally they're running a low blood pressure."</p>



<p>Sometimes, getting hydrated and adding salt to the diet may not be enough. Occasionally people need to take medications to improve blood pressure control and increase blood pressure to prevent fainting episodes, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical help</h2>



<p>"If somebody has had simple fainting with the clear precipitants that I described, it is best to have a chat with your GP (your primary care physician) to talk about it. Particularly if it's a first onset of symptoms, it's best not to ignore it," Dr. Behr says. "Often people go to the emergency department after a first faint, which I think is very fair to do and I would encourage."</p>



<p>If someone has had simple faints before, the circumstances that bring them on are typical for them and they have been evaluated by their primary care physician or a cardiologist before, they may not need to go to the emergency department every time, he adds.</p>



<p>The more concerning situations are older people having faints where other conditions may also be having an effect, people who are having recurrent faints despite keeping well hydrated, if there has been an injury due to a faint, and if the blackout comes on abruptly and with other signs that there may be an underlying cardiac condition.</p>



<p>"We need to make sure that they are treated and that something else isn't being missed," Dr. Behr says. "Also, sometimes faints can look like seizures. They can cause fitting activity, and differentiating a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seizure and epilepsy</a> from fainting requires involvement of a cardiologist and neurologist."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you faint at the sight of blood, you may be able to condition yourself not to</h2>



<p>"It's very common, but it can be surmounted by various means," Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioural therapy</a> (CBT) may help, he suggests. In CBT, you work with a mental health counselor such as a psychotherapist or therapist to become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking, so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them more effectively.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:10) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/02/SCRIPT-MCM-High-TriglyceridesJSEDIT7283.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Triglycerides, the main kind of fat in your body, store extra energy from the food you eat.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's an energy source. It's like a little battery used for energy. But too many triglycerides can also cause heart disease," says Dr. Fernandes.</p>



<p>People who are overweight, in general, have high triglyceride levels and good cholesterol levels that are low.</p>



<p>"They may get heart disease not because their LDL is high, they get heart disease because the HDL is low and the triglycerides is high," he says.</p>



<p>And this is significant for people in their 30s and 40s.</p>



<p>So what can you do?&nbsp;Reducing simple carbohydrates, such as refined sugars and flours, can help lower your weight and improve your cholesterol and triglyceride levels. And you can back that up with exercise.</p>
