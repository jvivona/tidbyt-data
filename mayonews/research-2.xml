<p>Cryptic antigens are part of a protein — known as epitopes — that are usually hidden or inaccessible to the immune system and may be present in tumor cells.</p>



<p>"These findings underscore the need to look at alternate sources of target antigens for ovarian cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/curtis-marion-r-ph-d/bio-20454201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marion R.

<p>Dr. Curtis explains that discovering tumor-associated antigens that T cells recognize is crucial for the success of immunotherapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer, where the growth of cells that form in the ovaries multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.</p>



<p>T cells are a critical component of the adaptive immune system. Their ability to recognize and respond to specific targets is fundamental to their function. They play a significant role in developing and treating cancer and are vital in the immune system's fight against infections.</p>



<p>The researchers characterized the tumor antigens generated from ovarian cancer using multi-omics approaches to determine their ability to trigger an immune response. Multi-omics encompasses using multiple “omes” (i.e., genome, proteome, microbiome, epigenome) to better understand the mechanisms of disease processes, detection, potential prevention and more focused therapies.</p>



<p>Researchers have previously focused on discovering newly formed antigens (neoantigens). However, a previous <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32047025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> revealed that neoantigens are rarely found in ovarian cancer samples, making them unattractive targets. While targeted immunotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been highly successful in treating multiple cancer types, patients with ovarian cancer have limited benefit from these approaches.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What lies ahead?</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers will explore cryptic antigens in designing new treatments, such as vaccines or immunotherapies, that could help the immune system target tumors more effectively. They plan to test these approaches in laboratory models and clinical trials to see if they work safely.</p>



<p>The next steps include larger-scale studies to identify the abundance of cryptic antigen expression across different tumor types and to understand how those levels of cryptic antigens may correlate with patients' responses to immunotherapy.</p>



<p>Such studies could pave the way for developing immunotherapies targeting cryptic antigens in other tumor types. Moreover, understanding how cryptic antigens are processed and presented could offer new strategies to help the body's immune system fight cancer. In the long term, these efforts could broaden the reach of immunotherapy to other forms of cancer that currently lack effective treatment options.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart surgery is a serious and invasive medical procedure, and that can be intimidating for a patient. A new study <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00474-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a> suggests that <a href="https://tryhealium.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual reality (VR)</a> can be an effective tool to reduce preoperative anxiety in older patients undergoing their first <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20123422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-heart surgery</a>. While much of the research to date using VR involved younger patient populations, these research findings suggest that immersive VR was effective and well tolerated in older patients. These reductions in anxiety are particularly significant given the known link between preoperative anxiety and negative postoperative outcomes, including increased pain, reduced activity and higher medication use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research represents a step forward in improving the patient experience and potentially using this approach to optimize postoperative recovery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, a cardiovascular disease researcher at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and senior author of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dearani-joseph-a-m-d/bio-00083538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Dearani, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stulak-john-m-m-d/bio-20133266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Stulak, M.D.</a>, both cardiac surgeons at Mayo Clinic involved with the study, emphasize the importance of emotional state before and after cardiac surgery. "We currently offer music and massage therapy after cardiac surgery because we know what a negative impact high anxiety has on recovery from surgery. Our team is now exploring broader implementation of VR — which can be used at any time and place, inside or outside the hospital — throughout the surgical episode to further evaluate its impact on clinical outcomes."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional anti-anxiety medications, which can have drawbacks such as increased difficulty placing the tube that helps a patient breathe during surgery and a longer time to remove the tube after surgery, VR offers a nonpharmacological alternative. The study also highlights the potential of VR as a flexible tool, with the tablet-based option providing a viable alternative for patients susceptible to VR-induced motion sickness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research included 100 participants who were scheduled for open-heart surgery. Each patient wore a monitor to record vital signs and completed a standardized, clinically validated anxiety test before and after the VR intervention on the day of surgery. The test asked them to rate their current state with 20 questions related to feelings ranging from calm to upset. Participants rated each feeling on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being "not at all" and 4 being "very much."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Half of the participants were assigned to a VR tablet and the other half to immersive VR goggles while they waited in the holding area prior to surgery. The VR provided a 10-minute nature experience with guided breathing as they viewed trees and a waterfront that changed through four seasons. The tablet played a video of the content seen by patients in VR, while people who used the immersive VR headset were able to look all around and identify environmental features, which helped them advance through the scene. Both interventions reduced the pulse rate of participants, but they did not affect respiration rate or oxygen levels.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall anxiety scores decreased an average of 2 points with the tablet treatment and 2.9 points with the VR goggles. Additionally, the researchers note that the scores improved considerably in up to seven of the anxiety-focused questions with the tablet and VR goggles. Several of those responses specifically represent a more positive outlook change from their previously negative feelings — a finding that has the researchers feeling optimistic about the abilities of VR to make surgery less stressful for patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asthma</a> is a condition in which the airways in the lungs narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus, making breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455,000 deaths, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>



<p>There is no cure for asthma, but its symptoms can be controlled. For patients with asthma, remission is considered the primary treatment goal, with fewer or no symptoms, and the patient requiring minimal to no medication to manage their condition.</p>



<p>Current asthma guidelines, including those of the <a href="https://www.ersnet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Respiratory Society</a> and the <a href="https://site.thoracic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Thoracic Society</a>, <a href="https://site.thoracic.org/"></a>define asthma severity based on a patient's medication dose — without taking into consideration the healthcare burden, such as how successfully patients can control their asthma, how often they visit their doctor, visit the emergency room and receive other healthcare services. In other words, what has been missing from the research behind current guidelines is data from the perspective of the patient's quality of life.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers propose a new, personalized approach to asthma using patient-centered information based on healthcare burden data instead of prescribed medication, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00250-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.</p>



<p>The Mayo-led study is the first to use two longitudinal asthma cohorts from the U.S. and 11 European countries to introduce a tool that measures both asthma control and severity and translates that data into a quantifiable exacerbation – a way to measure the risk of an asthma attack.</p>



<p>The investigators analyzed data from 1,037 adult participants from the <a href="http://www.severeasthma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severe Asthma Research Program III</a> in the U.S. and the <a href="https://europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-campaigns/past-projects/u-biopred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes</a> to calculate a composite asthma burden score based on asthma attacks and healthcare. They also added the number of instances each patient needed a rescue bronchodilator to reflect asthma symptom burden.</p>

<p>The lead author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zein-joe-m-d-ph-d/bio-20563702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Zein, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a pulmonary medicine and asthma researcher at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, says the findings show discrepancies between the current definition of asthma severity and the research team's burden score.</p>



<p>"The standard definition of severe asthma is based on prescribed asthma medications," says Dr. Zein. "Our personalized healthcare burden score includes patient-centered data that reflect disease severity and accurately predicts asthma remission."</p>



<p>Dr. Zein says the study looks at asthma remission using two well-characterized asthma cohorts. "Asthma remission has been proposed as a hypothesis. That is something we look at, but no one was analyzing the data to test it. This is the first study to test the concept of asthma remission," he says.</p>



<p>If further studies support the team's method of calculating asthma burden, it ultimately could help care teams better manage cases of high-risk individuals with asthma and improve their treatment.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155372502400165X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> study</a> highlights how a new debriefing tool is helping to improve the mental well-being of nurses.</p>



<p>The tool, which goes by the acronym BONE Break, is a structured approach designed to help address the emotional and psychological distress known as Second Victim Syndrome which can be experienced by people within healthcare teams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-left-align-caption">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Hess-Amberly-R._13600583_20220523-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399598" style="width:246px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Hess-Amberly-R._13600583_20220523-1.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Hess-Amberly-R._13600583_20220523-1-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amberly Hess, D.N.P.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"Second Victim Syndrome is the emotional toll that can occur after an adverse event in the hospital," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hess-amberly-r-aprn-cns-d-n-p/bio-20578380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amberly Hess, D.N.P.,</a> lead author of the study. "It's the feeling of guilt, self-blame and trauma that can arise when a healthcare worker is involved in or witnesses an adverse patient event."</p>



<p>To understand the debriefing tool's impact, researchers examined its use with registered nurses (RNs) in a 24-bed inpatient unit at Mayo Clinic over a nine-month time frame.</p>



<p>The BONE break tool is designed to be implemented within the first 30 minutes following an event, and to offer peer support and emotional processing to the nurses involved. The nurses who participated reported that they considered over 95% of the sessions helpful.</p>



<p>"One of the most significant insights we gained within the study was the difference between intellectualizing and emotionally processing what happens to us," says Hess.</p>



<p>"When I would run the BONE Break tool, I saw the physiologic changes in nurses," she adds. "I watched the shoulders relax and release tension."</p>



<p>Hess emphasizes that the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> played a pivotal role in developing and evaluating the BONE Break tool.</p>



<p>"The Kern Center provided the framework and allowed the study to grow," says Hess.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Blocker-Renaldo-C.-PhD_15891194_201712180948-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399605" style="width:213px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Blocker-Renaldo-C.-PhD_15891194_201712180948-1.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Blocker-Renaldo-C.-PhD_15891194_201712180948-1-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Renaldo Blocker, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"The nursing staff brought this study to the Kern Center and the collaboration was great," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/blocker-renaldo-c-ph-d/bio-20121385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renaldo Blocker, Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a human factors engineering researcher and senior author of the study.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Dr. Blocker is a Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Honored Investigator and leads a research team on cognitive engineering and neuroergonomics within the Kern Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers note that the nurses who participated were responsible for collecting data immediately following each BONE Break session, including the type of event, such as a patient fall.</p>



<p>The BONE Break debriefing process consisted of the following steps.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Buoy/Break:</strong>&nbsp;Nurses took a silent break or short pause to allow for space, then reflected on the statement, "You are a good nurse working in a very complex environment.<a>"</a> Peers then offered support using phrases such as "I cannot imagine what that must have been like for you. Can we talk about it?"</li>



<li><strong>Open-Up:</strong>&nbsp;The nurses then invited each other to talk about the event that had just occurred: "This has to be difficult. Are you OK?" and "How are you doing after the event?<a>"</a></li>



<li><strong>Needs:</strong>&nbsp;Nurses assessed one another’s needs following the event: "What do you need right now to be able to be successful in returning to work?"&nbsp;They offered each other affirmations surrounding those needs: "I believe in you."</li>



<li><strong>Exit/Evaluate:</strong>&nbsp;Afterward, nurses discussed the effectiveness of the debriefing before returning to the floor.</li>
</ul>



<p>"This study highlights the importance of practitioners and scientists working together to evaluate, assess and implement these formative tools," says Dr. Blocker.</p>



<p>Researchers hope to expand the debriefing tool to other healthcare teams.</p>



<p>"This is an easy tool to implement, and it takes just a couple of people to make it happen," says Hess. "If anybody's interested in enhancing the culture of their team, this is a good tool to have available."</p>

<p-->When Mayo Clinic approached Phoenix resident Kory Billie about helping researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rusk-annie-m-m-d/bio-20524022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Rusk, M.D.</a>, design a tobacco cessation intervention tailored for Native Americans, he jumped at the chance.<p></p>



<p>Billie, who has smoked most of his life, understands how using tobacco can negatively affect many aspects of a person's health. He is also a member of the Navajo Nation and has witnessed the challenges that family, friends and other members of his tribe have faced quitting tobacco. In recent years, he has watched the rising use of vaping among Navajo youth with concern. He wants to discourage young people from using tobacco except for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Annie Rusk, M.D.</p>
</div></div>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Billie's experiences made him an ideal candidate to advise Dr. Rusk on her research through a Mayo Clinic program called <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/community/community-engaged-research-program/resources/engagement-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Engagement (CE) Studios.</a></p>



<p>CE Studios is a consultation service that connects researchers to a group of "community experts" who represent the researcher's population of interest. These experts meet with the researcher, usually during a study's planning phase, to learn how the study is being designed, ask questions and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since Mayo Clinic introduced CE Studios in 2021, Dr. Rusk has used it numerous times. She believes community input is essential for all research projects, regardless of their focus.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"By involving people with lived experiences, we can gain valuable insights and ensure our research is relevant and impactful," says Dr. Rusk. "Even discovery science projects taking place in a lab can benefit from community perspectives."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lived experiences provide key insights</strong></h2>



<p>For the CE Studios session with Dr. Rusk, Billie joined three other community experts from tribes in the Midwest, Alaska and Canada in a virtual meeting. The four community experts were there to advise Dr. Rusk on <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20561829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new clinical trial</a>.</p>

</div></div>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Rusk's research focuses on understanding barriers to smoking cessation among Native Americans. She felt it was important to consult with people from a variety of Indigenous communities to ensure her research aligned with their community health needs and priorities.</p>



<p>Billie says he enjoyed this opportunity to connect with like-minded people from similar backgrounds, and to speak with Dr. Rusk about how tobacco use was affecting communities like his. He shared his experiences with homelessness and addiction, as well as the difficulty of accessing smoking cessation resources in Indian Country.</p>



<p>What Dr. Rusk learned from Billie and the other community experts during the CE Studios session motivated her to make an important change to her study design.</p>



<p>The elements of the study that resonated best with the community experts were those geared toward developing practical behavioral health interventions. Billie and the other experts emphasized that understanding the social and cultural drivers of smoking would be key to achieving meaningful outcomes. &nbsp;"You have to understand a person's environment and the way they're brought up," says Billie.</p>



<p>The community experts were less keen on a genetic analysis component Dr. Rusk had planned to include. They felt this aspect did not align meaningfully with community health priorities. Based on this feedback, Dr. Rusk eliminated this component from her study.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While incorporating this kind of feedback can be challenging, Dr. Rusk says the long-term benefits are worth it for all.</p>



<p>"Science seeking to cure disease and transform the way we deliver healthcare requires a direct connection to the people we serve," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Health is a blessing</strong></h2>



<p>Billie says he appreciated this chance to participate in CE Studios. He hopes that the knowledge he and the other experts shared will give Dr. Rusk the context she needs to develop a tobacco intervention that will have a lasting impact. He looks forward to hearing from her upon completion of the study to see the results.</p>



<p>He encourages other people to consider participating in CE Studios to help advance research to improve the health of their communities. He connects his motivation for this work to a Navajo proverb that reminds his people to live their lives with purpose:</p>



<p>"Remember to walk in beauty. Beauty before you and beauty behind you."</p>



<p>If the community can improve the health of its people today, he says, they will pass that blessing on to future generations.</p>

<p>Scientists have developed polygenic risk scores to analyze multiple genetic variants across a person's genome. These scores assess the likelihood of developing conditions such as heart and lung diseases, diabetes, asthma, and certain cancers.</p>

<p>"There's really no one singular variant in the genome that causes common diseases. It's really a lot of different variants across the genome, across our genomes that have weaker or milder effects on disease risk, but all together give us this increased risk," explains Dr. Ortega.</p>



<p>"With those discoveries, we've developed genetic risk scores, polygenic risk scores, where we bring together the effects or associations across variants, across entire genomes into a singular score," he continues.</p>



<p>Clinicians can then utilize these risk scores to potentially customize prevention and treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"These are quite early in development, but are potentially really, really important," says Dr. Wain. "In the future, we could use these to improve diagnosis where somebody is already presenting with the disease, but they need a specific diagnosis in order to access the medicines that are going to work for them." Dr. Ortega says the potential of polygenic risk scores is both exciting and promising.

<p-->Krabbe disease is a rare, <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/leukodystrophy#:~:text=Krabbe%20disease%20(also%20called%20globoid,disease%2C%20is%20symptomatic%20and%20supportive." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inherited neurological disease</a> that most commonly affects infants, but can also present later in life, including during adolescence and very rarely in adulthood, according to the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Current clinical laboratory testing identifies individuals with Krabbe disease, but it is challenging to provide a prognosis of the disease course. Symptoms include mental and motor skill weakness and deterioration, seizures, blindness and deafness.<p></p>



<p>"There's a need for biomarkers that can help differentiate infantile from later-onset forms of disease in a presymptomatic individual," said <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/oglesbee-devin-ph-d/bio-00092599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devin Oglesbee, Ph.D.</a>, a consultant in the Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics’ Clinical Biochemical Genetics Laboratory. "Developing new clinical assays for rare genetic disorders will help us get treatments to patients faster and before irreversible symptoms appear."</p>

<p><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> predoctoral candidate Rachel Wurth is working with Dr. Oglesbee and the Clinical Biochemical Genetics Laboratory on research that aims to discover new disease biomarkers that will complement current laboratory testing to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of Krabbe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our laboratory has a longstanding interest to improve the diagnosis of Krabbe disease," says Wurth. "My project aims to continue this effort by evaluating changes in many metabolites at once with a technique called untargeted metabolomics. Being able to conduct this research within the clinical laboratory provides an exciting opportunity to streamline translation and allow patients to benefit from research findings more quickly."</p>



<p>The outcomes of this research could lead to improvements in the diagnosis of Krabbe disease, predicting the course of disease and improving understanding of what changes in metabolism contribute to the condition.</p>



<p>Wurth recently was awarded a multi-year grant from Minnesota-based <a href="https://rosenaufoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rosenau Family Research Foundation</a>. Paul and Susan Rosenau's granddaughter lost her battle with Krabbe disease at 2 years of age. Their family’s foundation specifically supports research on Krabbe disease and cystic fibrosis.&nbsp;The award is $112,718 over two years.</p>

<p>Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted cancer therapies. They deliver potent drugs directly into cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissue. These therapies work by recognizing specific proteins found on the surface of cancer cells.</p>



<p>The proteins function like a lock and the therapy acts as a key, latching onto the cancer cells with precision to deliver the treatment.</p>



<p>But precision alone isn’t enough. Even when the key fits the lock, the door often stays closed. This prevents the drug from entering the cell to attack the cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a pioneering strategy that may help overcome this barrier. The approach combines antibody-drug conjugates with proteolysis-targeting chimeras. These molecular tools break down specific proteins to improve how cancer cells internalize the cancer-fighting therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-07439-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical study</a>, published in Communications Biology, the combined therapy improved the internalization of these treatments by up to 1.9 times in certain models.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The ability to target specific proteins and improve drug absorption into tumor cells represents a significant step forward in how we approach aggressive cancers," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mansfield-aaron-s-m-d/bio-20116851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Mansfield, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist and lead author of the study at the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a> and the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Mansfield and his team tested the approach using breast cancer organoids. They created these miniaturized, lab-grown versions of breast tissue to mimic the complexity of real tumors. Unlike traditional cell cultures, organoids better replicate how tumors behave in the body.</p>



<p>Specifically, the research focused on three proteins often found in aggressive cancers. These include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET). These proteins are associated with breast, lung and pancreatic cancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the study highlights the versatility of this approach by demonstrating potential benefits across multiple cancer types and protein targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/digestive-diseases/news/positive-patient-outcomes-associated-with-liver-transplant-plus-sleeve-gastrectomy-combination/mac-20458505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual procedure</a>&nbsp;is especially helpful for patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. MASLD happens when fat builds up in the liver, often without symptoms. It's mostly caused by obesity — defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. In advanced stages, MASLD can lead to serious liver damage that requires a transplant.</p>

<p>"Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease is the most common liver disease, not only in the United States but worldwide," says Dr. Heimbach.</p>



<p>As obesity rates rise, so does the need to treat patients with MASLD.</p>



<p>"When we have excess fat that builds up in the liver, this can lead to inflammation and scarring and even advanced liver disease," she says.</p>



<p>It won't cause complications for everyone, but, for some, it can progress to cirrhosis.</p>



<p>"When a patient develops&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487%20?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cirrhosis,</a>&nbsp;they can then need a liver transplant," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>



<p>And having extra weight can be a reason patients might not be eligible for transplant. At Mayo Clinic, the approach is to help patients with obesity as well as transplant.</p>

<p>"We consider both liver transplant and what's called a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleeve-gastrectomy/about/pac-20385183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleeve gastrectomy,</a> which is a type of weight-loss operation that can be used as a tool to help patients be successful in managing not only their liver disease with a liver transplant, but their obesity with the sleeve gastrectomy," Dr. Heimbach explains.</p>



<p>The procedures are done simultaneously with multiple teams working together. Dr. Heimbach says it's about providing patients the care they need.</p>



<p>"I'm excited about what transplant offers to all of our patients, which is to be able to return to the life that they had before they got sick. And for patients who were carrying extra weight, not only are they healthy again, but now they're able to really fully enjoy and be fully participating in their life," she says.</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ed40a55bf59e69bf7d15c35b321a0839"><em> A 3D animation of the region of the brain called the motor thalamus (shown in red and yellow) where Mayo Clinic researchers detected more precise information about brain cell activity in patients during deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS electrodes are placed into the motor thalamus to treat movement disorders.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic researchers have found a new way to more precisely detect and monitor brain cell activity during deep brain stimulation, a common treatment for movement disorders such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parkinson's disease</a> and tremor. This precision may help doctors adjust electrode placement and stimulation in real time, providing better, more personalized care for patients receiving the surgical procedure.<br></h2>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS) involves implanting electrodes in the brain that emit electrical pulses to alleviate symptoms. The electrodes remain inside the brain connected to a battery implanted near the collarbone and controlled by a remote control. While a neurologist and neurosurgeon monitor the brain waves throughout the surgery, the monitoring typically is limited to a narrow frequency range that provides a rough snapshot of brain activity.</p>



<p>However, Mayo Clinic researchers used more sensitive, research-grade equipment and custom algorithms to record a broader frequency range of brain cell activity that yielded higher resolution and more precise information on when and where brain cells were firing in patients during DBS surgery.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Klassen-Bryan-T.-MD_14357470_201505061157-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399245" style="width:214px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Klassen-Bryan-T.-MD_14357470_201505061157-1.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Klassen-Bryan-T.-MD_14357470_201505061157-1-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bryan Klassen, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We looked at brain activity in a different way and recorded a type of brain signal called 'broadband' that reflects the combined activity across all frequencies and is related to the firing of all brain cells in that region. We found that the broadband activity signal increased with movement and was more precise in location than the standard, more narrow frequency signal," says neurologist <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/klassen-bryan-t-m-d/bio-20055332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryan Klassen, M.D.</a>, lead author of the <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00419.2024?checkFormatAccess=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in the Journal of Neurophysiology.</p>



<p>Dr. Klassen and colleagues detected the broadband signal in the motor thalamus, a region deep within the brain that controls movement. Previous studies have detected it only on the surface of the brain.</p>



<p>The researchers recorded broadband signals associated with hand movement in 15 patients undergoing awake DBS. Each of the patients were instructed to open and close their hands while the researchers recorded brain cell activity in their thalamus.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Baker-Matthew-R._21449571_201907030220-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399246" style="width:208px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Baker-Matthew-R._21449571_201907030220-1.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Baker-Matthew-R._21449571_201907030220-1-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Baker, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This study enhances our understanding of how the thalamus, a brain region that is frequently targeted for deep brain stimulation, processes movement. It may lead to more precise mapping of the brain as well," says Mayo Clinic coauthor Matthew Baker, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the neurosurgery department.</p>



<p>Using broadband to monitor during DBS surgery may improve the treatment and outcomes for patients.</p>



<p>"These findings underscore the remarkable advances we can achieve through the close collaboration between the neurology and neurosurgery departments and will help us develop the next generation of brain stimulation therapies," says neurosurgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/miller-kai-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20456021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai Miller, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The next steps for this research involve further exploring how these brain activity patterns in the thalamus can be used to improve neurostimulation therapy, says Dr. Baker, a recent graduate of <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>.</p>



<p>"We will be investigating how this signal responds to different types of movements and whether we can use it to control new devices that only stimulate when patients need it, as opposed to constant stimulation, which is more prone to cause side effects," he says.</p>
