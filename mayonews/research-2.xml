</div></div>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Each year, many women undergo surgery for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20360557">pelvic organ prolapse</a>, a condition where weakened muscles and tissues allow organs like the bladder or uterus to shift and press against the vaginal wall. This typically results in feelings of tissue bulging from the vagina, pelvic pressure or urinary issues.</p>



<p>While the surgical procedure often alleviates symptoms, many women experience a common post-surgical complication: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447">urinary tract infections</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, researchers at Mayo Clinic, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/occhino-john-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20055145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Occhino, M.D.</a>, have found a way to potentially predict who will develop these infections before surgery even begins. </p>



<p>Their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-78809-1?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oa_20241122&amp;amp;utm_content=10.1038%2Fs41598-024-78809-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> reveals that specific patterns in the vaginal microbiome — a community of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses — could serve as early indicators of urinary tract infection risk.&nbsp;Their findings are published in Nature Scientific Reports.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zeroing in on key bacteria</strong></h2>



<p>Their findings show that women with lower levels of the protective bacterial species <em>Lactobacillus</em> were more likely to develop urinary tract infections following pelvic organ prolapse surgery. In addition, they found that higher levels of <em>Prevotella</em> and <em>Gardnerella</em> — bacteria linked to inflammation and infection — are also associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The research also provides insights on how surgery itself impacts the microbiome. Samples taken after surgery showed notable disruptions to both the vaginal and urinary microbiomes. These changes included lower microbial diversity, which can leave the body more vulnerable to infection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons for the changes are likely multifactorial and may include preoperative antibiotic administration, vaginal cleansing prior to surgery and surgery itself.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our ability to detect these microbiome patterns provides a potential opportunity to personalize treatment strategies and improve outcomes," says Dr. Walther-Antonio, a microbiome researcher at Microbiomics Program at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>. Dr. Walther-Antonio also conducts research in the Departments of Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynecology, as well as the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Walther-Antonio's collaboration with Dr. Occhino bridges a gap between cutting-edge research and clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Understanding the microbiome's role in post-surgical infections gives us a unique opportunity to possibly prevent these complications altogether," says Dr. Occhino, a Mayo Clinic urogynecologic surgeon. Dr. Occhino specializes in treating pelvic floor disorders, including conditions like pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning microbiome data into action</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study analyzed microbiome samples from postmenopausal women undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic reconstruction. Researchers collected samples using vaginal swabs or urine collection at five stages, including before surgery, immediately after and during recovery. Advanced sequencing techniques were used to map the genetic material of the microbes and identify changes in the microbial communities.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Walther-Antonio and Dr. Occhino plan to expand their research to include larger and more diverse patient groups. This effort aims to confirm their findings and explore interventions. This could include using probiotics to restore microbial balance before surgery or adjusting surgical timing for at-risk patients.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dr. Walther-Antonio's other recent microbiome discoveries</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Walther-Antonio's expertise in microbiome research extends beyond surgical outcomes.

<p><em>Findings will help identify patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer who may benefit from targeted therapies </em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Findings from a multi-institutional, international study led by researchers from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> have significantly advanced the understanding of genetic alterations in the BRCA2 gene, a key player in hereditary cancer risk. The researchers completed a comprehensive functional assessment of all possible variants within the crucial DNA-binding domain of BRCA2, resulting in the clinical classification of 91% of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in this part of the gene. This finding dramatically improves the accuracy of genetic testing and will allow healthcare professionals to offer more precise risk assessments and personalized treatment plans for people carrying these variants.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to analyze the functional impact of almost 7,000 BRCA2 variants, definitively identifying those that increase cancer risk and those that do not. This new information will eliminate much of the uncertainty surrounding VUS, allowing for more informed decisions regarding cancer screening, preventive measures and treatment strategies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906-240x300.jpg" alt="Dr. Fergus Couch" class="wp-image-398743" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This research is a major advancement in understanding the role of many BRCA2 variants in cancer predisposition," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professor of Medical Research at Mayo Clinic. "Until now, patients who carried VUS often worried if they would develop cancer, but now with the classification of these variants, we can provide a clearer picture of cancer risk and tailor both prevention strategies as well as breast cancer treatment accordingly."</p>



<p>The findings have immediate implications for genetic testing laboratories and healthcare professionals, aiding them in offering more precise and personalized care to patients with VUS. Many people with VUS may be notified about the reclassification of their VUS as the ClinVar BRCA1/2 expert panel and testing laboratories use the new information in testing reports and updates.&nbsp; In addition, this new insight will aid in identifying patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast, ovarian</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355427#:~:text=The%20connection%20between%20breast%20cancer%20and%20pancreatic%20cancer,to%20see%20if%20there%20is%20a%20mutation%20present." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> who might benefit from targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;"We now have a catalog of every possible VUS in this part of BRCA2 that can be used to guide clinical care," says Dr. Couch.</p>



<p>The researchers say that this research lays the groundwork for future studies characterizing and classifying all BRCA2 variants across diverse populations and cancer types, improving risk assessment for everyone.</p>



<p>The study involved collaborators at Ambry Genetics Inc., Duke University, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania and several contributing studies from the CARRIERS consortium. The study was supported by funding from the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer SPORE (P50 CA116201) and R35 Outstanding Investigator Programs, the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</p>

<p>Most patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a> and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) experience the gradual onset and progression of cognitive symptoms, leading to decline over years or decades. However, in a small subset of patients, symptoms begin rapidly, leading to dementia within one year and complete incapacitation within two years of symptom onset. A new study at Mayo Clinic aims to determine why patients with Alzheimer’s disease and ADRD develop this rapidly progressive dementia (RPD).</p>

<p>"The factors that give rise to extreme, rapidly progressive clinical traits are unknown," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a neurologist and clinical researcher at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "These cases are challenging to treat in practice because there are many possible causes and diseases to consider, many tests that can be done and a clear need to coordinate evaluations rapidly."</p>



<p>Dr. Day will lead a team of researchers from Mayo Clinic in Florida and Rochester, Minnesota, to study the biology of RPD through a project funded by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIA/NIH).</p>



<p>Specifically, the research team and collaborators aim to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Determine the factors that make patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD susceptible to RPD.</li>



<li>Study the contributions of amyloid and tau toxic proteins and vascular changes in the brain to rates of progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD.</li>



<li>Identify cellular pathways that contribute to rapid declines in patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD.</li>
</ul>



<p>The researchers plan to collect clinical and genomic information from 120 diverse patients with rapid progressive Alzheimer's disease and ADRD over the next three years. Findings in patients with RPD, identified through <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alzheimers.gov%2Ftaking-action%2Fnational-research-centers&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeWidt.Lynda%40mayo.edu%7C01e3d5ed25404a72ef7508dd204e7812%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638702243568200049%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=EPwSTtRW86v3%2BsGbL9%2BLJFWKX%2BKnUyi2UKWZilAJDuA%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers</a> studies nationally, will be compared with data from participants with typical progressive Alzheimer's disease and ADRD enrolled in studies at the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/alzheimers-disease-research-center/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Mayo Clinic</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team hopes to learn how factors such as age, sex, medical history, structural and social determinants of health, genetic variants and other brain changes may make some patients more susceptible to rapid decline. Findings will be validated through expansive protein analyses in cerebrospinal fluid from an independent group of patients with autopsy-confirmed rapid progressive Alzheimer's disease and ADRD. Results will be extended to identify biomarkers and disease-modifying targets that may improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD.</p>



<p>"This project represents a substantial investment from NIH to study patients with RPD," says Dr. Day. "We hope the results of our research will inform new approaches, diagnostic tests and treatment targets that will improve outcomes in patients with AD/ADRD. The ultimate goal is to slow down the pathologic progression of disease in these patients, independent of their rate of decline."</p>



<p>The research will combine Mayo Clinic's expertise in digital innovation and telemedicine to engage patients across the United States. This study will also leverage Mayo's Clinical Trials Beyond Walls program, which allows patients to complete some, if not all assessments from the comfort of their own homes or local community facilities. The decentralized clinical trials initiative is designed to remove barriers to clinical trial participation by providing digital solutions and remote services to reimagine the trial experience for all involved, including participants, investigators, study teams and clinical care providers. Decentralized research ― studies conducted outside the walls of traditional research facilities ― may use a wide range of technologies and services such as telehealth, remote monitoring, mobile phlebotomy, retail pharmacy and home healthcare.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39503653/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20A%20history%20of%20HDP,addition%20to%20traditional%20risk%20factors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new study</a> has revealed a significant link between a common pregnancy complication and early heart disease in women.</p>



<p>Researchers found that women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) were at higher risk of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a> at an earlier age. In addition, they found that women with these disorders were at higher risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cardiovascular-diseases/news/advancing-the-understanding-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-artery-disease-minoca/mac-20574642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA</a>) — heart attacks that occur when the coronary arteries appear normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) — such as gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension and preeclampsia — affect 15% of women during their reproductive years. Marked by high blood pressure, the effects of these disorders continue to impact the health of mothers and babies well after pregnancy.</p>



<p>Compared to women with a history of normotensive (normal blood pressure) pregnancies, women in this study with a history of HDP were at greater risk for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Early onset of coronary artery disease: Occurring on average seven years earlier among women with a history of HDP.</li>



<li>More severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease: Twice as likely among women with a history of HDP.</li>



<li>Increased risk of MINOCA: Twice as likely among women with a history of HDP.</li>
</ul>

<p>"This research highlights the need for earlier screening for heart disease among women with a history of high blood pressure in pregnancy, particularly for MINOCA, which is up to five times more common in women than in men," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/garovic-vesna-d-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vesna Garovic, M.D., Ph.D</a>., a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>To improve patient care and outcomes for women, the researchers say clinicians should not only screen for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors, but they should also screen for non-traditional risk factors associated with MINOCA and other non-obstructive types of coronary artery disease, such as stress, autoimmune diseases — and now, HDP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does high blood pressure in pregnancy lead to coronary artery disease?</strong></h2>



<p>According to the researchers, there are two related types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-vessel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small vessel heart disease</a> that may make it more likely for women to develop HDP and coronary artery disease:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Microvascular dysfunction: Women with a history of HDP often have this underlying problem, which occurs when the small blood vessels that feed the heart stop working as they should, decreasing blood flow to the heart.</li>



<li>Endothelial dysfunction: This is a problem common to both HDP and coronary artery disease. It occurs when the cells that line the inside of blood vessels malfunction, narrowing instead of dilating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Together, these dysfunctions clog or narrow the arteries and small blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, which can lead to coronary artery disease without any physical blockage (non-obstructive). The researchers think it's possible that these processes may feed on one another, creating an environment where coronary artery disease is more likely to occur.</p>



<p>Further research, including large prospective studies, are needed to understand the mechanisms linking HDP to coronary artery disease, such as specific biomarkers and genetic factors that contribute to increased risk.</p>



<p>Read the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39503653/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> to learn more about the study, including funding and disclosures.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A growing body of research on high blood pressure in pregnancy</strong></h2>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have pioneered an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, called OmicsFootPrint, that helps convert vast amounts of complex biological data into two-dimensional circular images.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Omics is the study of genes, proteins and other molecular data to help uncover how the body functions and how diseases develop. By mapping this data, the OmicsFootPrint may provide clinicians and researchers with a new way to visualize patterns in diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, that can help guide personalized therapies. It may also provide an intuitive way to explore disease mechanisms and interactions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of the tool are published in a new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39445795/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in&amp;nbsp;Nucleic Acids Research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Data becomes most powerful when you can see the story it's telling," says Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D., lead author of the study and associate professor of biomedical informatics at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</a> "The OmicsFootPrint could open doors to discoveries we haven't been able to achieve before."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Simplifying complex data</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genes act as the body’s instruction manual, while proteins carry out those instructions to keep cells functioning. Sometimes, changes in these instructions — called mutations — can disrupt this process and lead to disease. The OmicsFootPrint helps make sense of these complexities by turning data — such as gene activity, mutations and protein levels — into colorful, circular maps that offer a clearer picture of what’s happening in the body.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In their study, the researchers used the OmicsFootPrint to analyze drug response and cancer multi-omics data. The tool distinguished between two types of breast cancer — lobular and ductal carcinomas — with an average accuracy of 87%. When applied to lung cancer, it demonstrated over 95% accuracy in identifying two types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Small data sets bring big impacts</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study showed that combining several types of molecular data produces more accurate results than using just one type of data.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The OmicsFootPrint also shows potential in providing meaningful results even with limited datasets. It uses advanced AI methods that learn from existing data and apply that knowledge to new scenarios — a process known as transfer learning. In one example, it helped researchers achieve over 95% accuracy in identifying lung cancer subtypes using less than 20% of the typical data volume.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This approach could be beneficial for research even with small sample size or clinical studies," Dr. Kalari says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To enhance its accuracy and insights, the OmicsFootPrint framework also uses an advanced method called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP highlights the most important markers, genes or proteins that influence the results to help researchers understand the factors driving disease patterns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From research to clinical practice</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Beyond research, the OmicsFootPrint is designed for clinical use. It compresses large biological datasets into compact images that require just 2% of the original storage space. This could make the images easy to integrate into electronic medical records to guide patient care in the future.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team plans to expand the OmicsFootPrint to study other diseases, including neurological diseases and other complex disorders. They are also working on updates to make the tool even more accurate and flexible, including the ability to find new disease markers and drug targets.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers and collaborators have described — for the first time — the prevalence of <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune diseases</a> in the U.S. Their research, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, reports that about 15 million people are estimated to have one or more of 105 autoimmune diseases. The study also found that autoimmune diseases occur most often in women and identified the top autoimmune diseases by prevalence, sex and age.</p>

<p>"Knowing the number of patients with an autoimmune disease in the U.S. is critical to assess whether these diseases are increasing or decreasing over time and with treatment," says the study's corresponding author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>, vice-chair of translational research for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Knowing this number is also critical for funding agencies to raise money and awareness for research into autoimmune diseases as a group and for individual autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Knowing which diseases occur more often in males or females and at what age is critical in understanding the pathogenesis of disease and how they impact the healthcare system."&amp;nbsp; Dr. Fairweather also leads the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/translational-cardiovascular-disease-research/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Translational Cardiovascular Disease Research Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>To conduct the study, Dr. Fairweather and co-senior author Aaron Abend from the <a href="https://www.autoimmuneregistry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Autoimmune Registry</a> used electronic health record data from over 10 million patients from six large medical systems in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Iowa, Wisconsin and Missouri who had been diagnosed with at least one of 105 autoimmune diseases considered in the study. They then extended the data to an estimated U.S. population of 333.3 million. The researchers developed a program algorithm to compute the first nationwide prevalence estimate of autoimmune diseases as a category. Dr. Fairweather says previous U.S. estimates were based on meta-analyses and extrapolations for individual autoimmune diseases, which can make estimations of prevalence inaccurate. She says many challenges have existed to obtain accurate prevalence data, including the lack of international consensus on a definition of autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>The findings indicated that about 15 million people, or 4.6% of the U. S. population, were diagnosed with at least one autoimmune disease between January 2011 and January 2022, and that 34% of those individuals were diagnosed with more than one autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>The study also found:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Females (63% of those with autoimmune disease) were almost twice as likely as males (37%) to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.</li>



<li>65% of patients had one autoimmune disease.</li>



<li>24% of patients had two autoimmune diseases.</li>



<li>8% of patients had three autoimmune diseases.</li>



<li>2% of patients had four or more autoimmune diseases.</li>
</ul>



<p>The top five diseases based on prevalence were rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, type I diabetes, Graves' disease and autoimmune thyroiditis.</p>



<p>"What dramatically stands out with this assessment is that the most prevalent autoimmune diseases occur in women and autoimmune diseases that occur more often in men occur rarely," says Dr. Fairweather. "This raises important questions that need to be answered with more research. For example, could this be the result of diagnosis bias, or is this a fundamental biological sex difference?"</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather served on a National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) committee on autoimmune diseases and testified before Congress in May 2022 to give recommendations for advancing research in autoimmune diseases. This led to the establishment of a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/in-the-spotlight/all-articles/orwh-announces-formation-of-new-office-of-autoimmune-disease-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Autoimmune Disease Research</a> within the Office of Research on Women's Health. In December 2023, the NIH sought input from members of the scientific community, federal partners, academic institutions, the private sector, health professionals, professional societies, advocacy groups, patient communities and other interested people for the development of an NIH-wide strategic plan to advance autoimmune disease research.</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather says her team has provided the program algorithm freely to the research community, allowing anyone to leverage this research tool to replicate the study using almost any healthcare database. In addition, researchers can use the tool over time to track shifts in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases, offering valuable insights for future research.</p>



<p>This research was partially funded by a National Institutes of Health grant under award R01 HL164520. For a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding, see the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — The&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.minnesotapartnership.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical Genomics (MNP)</a>&amp;nbsp;has announced its four research awardees for 2024. MNP is funded by the State of Minnesota and provides support for innovative research conducted by teams from the University of Minnesota (UMN) and Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Totaling $3 million, this year's awards support innovative projects on cognitive aging, cardiovascular disease, cancer and pulmonary hypertension.</p>



<p>They are:</p>



<p><strong>An essential role for complement signaling in microglia on diet-induced hypothalamic neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and aging-associated cognitive impairment.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/alessandro-bartolomucci" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alessandro Bartolomucci, Ph.D.</a> (UMN), <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/baker-darren-j-ph-d-m-s/bio-00027985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darren J. Baker, Ph.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic)</p>



<p>Obesity increases a patient's risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms linking obesity to AD remain unclear. Research has shown that obesity drives inflammation in the brain by activating a type of neuro-specific immune cell called microglia. Complement 3a receptor 1 (C3aR1) has been shown to mediate immune responses in many cell types, including microglia, in many disease states, including obesity. This project aims to determine whether blocking C3aR1 can reduce obesity-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. If successful, the findings could identify a potential new drug target for AD.</p>



<p><strong>Macrophage networks and checkpoints in cardiovascular disease.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lutgens-esther-m-d-ph-d/bio-20561018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esther Lutgens, M.D., Ph.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic), <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/jop-van-berlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jop van Berlo, M.D., Ph.D.</a> (UMN)</p>



<p>Inflammation is a key driver of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with macrophages being one of the primary cell types responsible for this inflammation. Immunotherapies that reduce macrophage activation may help lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients. There are various subtypes of macrophages, and this project aims to identify which subtypes contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis and heart failure. Specifically, the team will investigate whether immunotherapies targeting macrophage subtypes expressing immune checkpoints can inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and heart failure. If successful, the project could lead to the discovery of new drug targets for CVD.</p>



<p><strong>Identifying T cell subsets contributing to immune related adverse events caused by immunotherapy.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/vaiva-vezys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaiva Vezys, Ph.D.</a> (UMN), <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rogers-laura-m-ph-d/bio-20472660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura M. Rogers, Ph.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic)</p>



<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are groundbreaking cancer treatments and are now widely used as the first option for many types of cancer. However, there's no way to predict which patients will respond well to ICIs, and serious side effects — called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) — occur in about 55% of patients. These side effects happen because ICIs activate T cells, a type of immune cell, which can mistakenly attack healthy parts of the body while targeting cancer. This project will use a new mouse model, developed by the team, to study how specific subtypes of T cells contribute to the side effects caused by ICIs. If successful, the research could lead to new tools to predict and reduce side effects, improving cancer treatments for many patients.</p>



<p><strong>Understanding Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) in Vascular Remodeling of Pulmonary Hypertension.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://hi.umn.edu/research/faculty/aleksandra-babicheva-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aleksandra Babicheva, Ph.D.</a> (UMN), <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pabelick-christina-m-m-d/bio-00027256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Pabelick, M.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic)</p>



<p>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious, progressive disease defined by high arterial pressure in the lungs and has limited treatment options aside from a lung transplant. One type of PH, called Group 3 PH, is linked to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and affects the largest number of patients. Unfortunately, these patients tend to have the poorest survival rates, and there are currently no effective medications to treat it. In PH, the blood vessels in the lungs become narrowed and damaged over time, making it harder for blood to flow, which is known as vascular remodeling. One process involved in vascular remodeling is called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), where endothelial cells take on characteristics of mesenchymal cells (smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts), which are more pro-fibrotic. This study aims to mechanistically evaluate how hypoxia and specific vascular remodeling processes play a role in Group 3 PH. If successful, this research could help identify a new treatment to prevent or slow down the damage to lung blood vessels in PH patients</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers spent 2024 mining patient data, leveraging artificial intelligence and conducting clinical trials to reveal insights that improve patient care.</h3>



<p><em>By Mayo Clinic staff</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center physicians and scientists are researching the causes of cancer and its recurrence, innovating new methods to detect cancer as early as possible, and developing new and more effective treatments. Here are some of their top success stories from the past year:</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/25/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New study finds triple-negative breast cancer tumors with an increase in immune cells have lower risk of recurrence after surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>A multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044575#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20cancer%20recurrence,cells%20from%20your%20cancer%20remained." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a>&amp;nbsp;and better survival rates — even without chemotherapy treatment. The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;was published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>The immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&amp;nbsp;tumor and&amp;nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;nbsp;</a>and first author of the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/30/mayo-researchers-invented-a-new-class-of-ai-to-improve-cancer-research-and-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo researchers invented a new class of AI to improve cancer research and treatments</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers recently invented a new class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms called hypothesis-driven AI, which is a significant departure from traditional AI models that learn solely from data. In a review published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38398213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>, the researchers note that this emerging class of AI offers an innovative way to use massive datasets to help discover the complex causes of diseases such as cancer and improve treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"This fosters a new era in designing targeted and informed AI algorithms to solve scientific questions, better understand diseases, and guide individualized medicine," says senior author and co-inventor&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/li-hu-ph-d/bio-20035057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hu Li, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Systems biology and AI researcher in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. "It has the potential to uncover insights missed by conventional AI."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/06/11/melanoma-in-darker-skin-tones-race-and-sex-play-a-role-mayo-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Melanoma in darker skin tones: Race and sex play a role, Mayo study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>Melanoma is often detected later in people with darker skin complexions, and the consequences can be devastating, a Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;reveals. While&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">melanoma</a>&amp;nbsp;may be found less frequently in people with darker complexions than fair ones, this serious form of cancer can affect anyone. The study consisted of 492,597 patients with melanoma. Findings suggests that added vigilance in early screening is particularly needed for Black men, whose cancers are often found at later stages, leading to worse outcomes compared to white patients.</p>



<p>"We compared non-Hispanic Black patients to white patients and saw striking differences in how patients presented with the disease," says surgical oncologist&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study and a researcher at&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We saw more extremity melanoma and more later-stage disease."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/07/04/new-research-platform-assesses-brain-cancer-mutations-during-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research platform assesses brain cancer mutations during surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318843121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mayo Clinic researchers report on a new surgical platform used during brain cancer surgery that informs critical decision-making about tumor treatment within minutes. The platform uses mass spectrometry, a sensitive technique used to analyze substances in tissue samples, to identify a key gene mutation in&amp;nbsp;brain cancer in real time.</p>



<p>The researchers say that, in addition to enabling real-time diagnosis, the platform allows surgeons to determine a patient's prognosis and perform tumor resection to improve patient outcomes. In the future, the new platform will help surgeons tailor treatment to the molecular features of a tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/14/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo Clinic study uncovers genetic cancer risks in 550 patients</strong></a></p>



<p>Current screening protocols fail to catch a notable number of people carrying genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome, which increase the risk of developing certain cancers. This issue is particularly pronounced among underrepresented minorities.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.24.00106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, published in JCO Precision Oncology, are based on genetic screenings of more than 44,000 study participants from diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the exomes, the protein-coding regions of genes where most disease-causing mutations are found. They identified 550 people (1.24% of participants) as carriers of the hereditary mutations.&amp;nbsp;Importantly, half of these people were previously unaware of their hereditary genetic risk, and 40% did not meet existing clinical guidelines for genetic testing.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/20/new-research-discovers-a-new-combination-of-therapy-for-people-with-a-type-of-leukemia-leading-them-to-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research discovers a new combination of therapy for people with a type of leukemia, leading them to live longer</strong></a></p>



<p>In a new multicenter, international study led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, researchers found that people with the B-cell precursor subtype of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (BCP-ALL), who also lacked a genetic abnormality known as the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/multimedia/how-the-philadelphia-chromosome-forms/img-20007421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia chromosome</a>&amp;nbsp;and were in remission with no trace of cancer, showed significantly higher survival rates when blinatumomab was added to their chemotherapy treatment. The randomized study results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>



<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center hematologist. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/27/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Detecting pancreatic cancer through changes in body composition and metabolism</strong></a></p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, research findings from Mayo Clinic represent a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that could help in early detection.</p>



<p>Researchers examined medical records of patients with a common type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">pancre</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">tic cancer</a> known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms, the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in various physiological and metabolic measurements. The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in early detection.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/11/05/radiopharmaceutical-therapy-shows-favorable-results-for-people-with-tough-to-treat-meningioma-brain-tumors-mayo-clinic-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Radiopharmaceutical therapy shows favorable results for people with tough-to-treat meningioma brain tumors, Mayo Clinic study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>A radiopharmaceutical therapy that has successfully extended progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors shows early signs of delivering similar benefits to patients with difficult-to-treat&amp;nbsp;meningioma, a type of brain tumor. The nonrandomized phase 2 study's findings were presented at the&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've found a therapy with a meaningful signal for effectiveness and safety for people with refractory meningioma, a condition with no standard treatment options," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Merrell, M.D.</a>, lead researcher of the trial and a radiation oncologist at&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may improve overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed&amp;nbsp;glioblastoma&amp;nbsp;while maintaining their quality of life. The phase 2, single-arm study results are published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months, and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. "As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-treatment-could-delay-cancer-progression-in-patients-with-high-risk-smoldering-multiple-myeloma/"><strong>Research shows new treatment could delay cancer progression in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma</strong></a></p>



<p>A new treatment is showing promise for people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). This precancerous condition can progress to active&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer. High-risk SMM carries a higher likelihood of progression.</p>



<p>Results from a phase 3 clinical trial, published in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a>&amp;nbsp;and presented at the <a href="https://www.hematology.org/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Hematology meeting</a>, demonstrated that daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells, significantly reduces the risk of progression to active multiple myeloma and improves overall survival compared to active monitoring.</p>



<p>"These results are a major advancement in the treatment of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. Vincent Rajkumar, M.D.</a>, hematologist,&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;nbsp;and lead investigator of the trial. "For the first time, we have a treatment option that can significantly delay or prevent the progression to active disease, improving patients' lives and offering them a chance at a longer, healthier future."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>



<p>"We think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disease research. We hope to save time and resources and avoid the development of therapies that fail upon translation into patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, who leads the Translational Neuroimmunology Lab.&amp;nbsp;"Understanding which treatments show potential for success in human organoids could dramatically accelerate the rate of new therapies for patients with unmet needs."</p>

<p>Early detection improves treatment outcomes for endometrial and ovarian cancers, yet far too often, women are diagnosed when in advanced stages of these diseases.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sung-jaeyun-ph-d/bio-20320110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeyun Sung, Ph.D.</a>, developed an innovative computational tool that analyzes the gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms within the digestive system, to provide insights into overall well-being. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51651-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Nature Communications, the tool demonstrated at least 80% accuracy in differentiating healthy people from those with any disease. The tool, called Gut Microbiome Wellness Index 2, could detect even subtle changes in gut health, identifying whether a person may be progressing toward or recovering from a disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Finally, we have a standardized index to quantitatively measure how healthy a person's gut microbiome is," says Dr. Sung, the senior author and computational biologist at Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine's Microbiomics Program. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-researchers-develop-tool-that-measures-health-of-a-persons-gut-microbiome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more.</a>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a significant advancement for rare disease research, Mayo Clinic scientists developed a semi-automated system, known as RENEW, to rapidly reanalyze unresolved rare disease cases. Described in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38538918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Human Genetics, RENEW (REanalysis of NEgative Whole-exome/genome data) provided probable diagnoses for 63 of 1,066 undiagnosed cases. This innovative technology, launched in 2022, continuously compares patient genomic data against the latest global research, uncovering previously elusive genetic variants linked to disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Considering that the majority of patients with rare diseases who undergo genomic sequencing remain without a diagnosis, this is no small accomplishment," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a>, a translational omics researcher at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine and lead author of the study.

<p>Mayo Clinic scientists have developed an immunotherapy strategy that potentially lays the groundwork for treating a spectrum of autoimmune diseases. The new technique, detailed in a preclinical study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a>, involves combining chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), resulting in engineered stem cells known as CAR-MSCs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pioneering approach shows potential in targeting inflammatory disease sites more precisely and improving immunosuppression and healing outcomes,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a principal investigator and hematologist at Mayo Clinic. “We’re planning to study interventions that minimize the need for long-term medications for autoimmune diseases.” <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-scientists-pioneer-immunotherapy-technique-for-autoimmune-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sung-jaeyun-ph-d/bio-20320110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeyun Sung, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/warrington-kenneth-j-m-d/bio-00027302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Warrington, M.D.</a>, discovered protein patterns in the blood that could improve the diagnosis and monitoring of giant cell arteritis. This chronic autoimmune disease causes inflammation in blood vessels and can lead to vision loss or stroke if untreated. The <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2024/08/16/ard-2024-225868.info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, analyzed over 7,000 proteins using proteomics. Researchers developed machine learning models that identified active disease versus remission with over 95% accuracy. This work lays the foundation for more precise diagnosis and personalized treatment options.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This precision enables us to refine treatment decisions," says Dr. Warrington, a rheumatologist and Director of the Vasculitis Clinic in the Division of Rheumatology in the Department of Internal Medicine. "Recognizing when a patient's disease is in remission allows us to reduce reliance on certain medications, which can minimize side effects and improve overall patient care."&amp;nbsp; <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/innovative-blood-analysis-technique-reveals-insights-into-giant-cell-arteritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more.</a>&amp;nbsp;</p>
