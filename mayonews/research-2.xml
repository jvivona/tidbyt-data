<p><br>A comprehensive review published by Mayo Clinic researchers advances the understanding of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited form of kidney disease and the fourth leading cause of kidney failure worldwide.</p>



<p>Published in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</a>, the review advances the understanding of ADPKD, which accounts for 5-10% of kidney failure in the U.S. and Europe. Its prevalence in the U.S. is 9.3 cases per 10,000 people.</p>

<p>"This is a vital resource for healthcare providers to stay informed about the latest diagnostic tools and treatment strategies to enhance patient care," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chebib-fouad-t-m-d/bio-20434759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fouad Chebib, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and first author of the review. "It covers how the disease disrupts the normal functioning of the body, signs and symptoms of the disease, diagnosis, treatment and the likely outcome, equipping healthcare providers to manage this complex condition, improving the quality of life through timely, evidence-based care."</p>



<p>Physicians typically diagnose ADPKD in patients who are between the ages of 27 and 42. The disease causes fluid-filled cysts to grow on the kidneys, leading to kidney failure. Over 90% of people over age 35 diagnosed with ADPKD also present with multiple liver cysts, which can cause discomfort or pain.</p>



<p>ADPKD symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience high blood pressure, pain in the back or side, blood in the urine, frequent urinary tract infections and kidney stones.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Hypertension affects 70-80% of people with ADPKD, and 9-14% of them develop brain aneurysms (a weakened and bulging area in the wall of a blood vessel), which have a low rupture rate.</p>



<p>A change in one of two genes, PKD1 (78%) or PKD2 (15%), causes most cases of ADPKD. If a person has one of these changes, they have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their children. However, 10-25% of people have a genetic alteration not inherited from either parent.</p>



<p>The review provides practical guidance on managing blood pressure, sodium intake, hydration and lifestyle changes to delay complications such as kidney failure, liver cysts and hypertension to slow disease progression.</p>



<p>A key tool in managing the disease is the Mayo Imaging Classification (MIC), which predicts the severity of the disease based on a person's kidney size and growth rate. Higher MIC classifications indicate faster growth and an earlier need for kidney replacement (dialysis or kidney transplantation). Roughly half of ADPKD patients need kidney replacement therapy by age 62.</p>



<p>The review also explores the use of novel therapies, such as the drug tolvaptan, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow kidney function decline for high-risk adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.</p>

<p>"This drug improves care and paves the way for future therapies that enhance the quality of life and delay kidney failure," explains <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dahl-neera-k-m-d-ph-d/bio-20563449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neera Dahl, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic nephrologist and senior author of the review.</p>



<p>The review recommends that a kidney specialist who manages patients with ADPKD should share decision-making with the patient regarding genetic testing, treatments, monitoring and aneurysm screening. This collaborative approach recognizes the importance of the physician's medical expertise and the patient's values, preferences, and goals. It also says patients with ADPKD should be aware of the symptoms of ruptured aneurysms (sudden, severe headache) and the need for immediate medical attention should they experience those symptoms.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new study by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> researchers found that the presence of a specific genetic mutation — KRAS circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) — strongly indicates a higher risk of cancer spread and worse survival rates for patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma</a> (PDAC). The mutation was identified using a readily available and clinically approved blood and abdominal fluid test.</p>



<p>PDAC is an aggressive form of cancer that is often difficult to diagnose. Most patients already have cancer spread to other parts of their body when initially diagnosed, and current tests often miss this hidden spread. This makes it challenging to determine the best treatment strategy. The findings, published in the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1245/s10434-025-17036-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgical Oncology</a>, may help identify patients who are more likely to have cancer spread to other parts of the body, therefore providing doctors and patients with the right information to make informed decisions about treatment.</p>



<p>"This is a major advancement for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/truty-mark-j-m-d-m-s/bio-20114332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Truty, M.D.</a>, hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgical oncologist within Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20475393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Surgery</a>. Dr. Truty is senior author of the study. "We've had this genetic testing available for a number of years, however, we did not know the significance of the results or how to interpret them. Having the KRAS status will allow the patient and their provider to make better decisions about their individual cancer treatment."</p>



<p>The prospective cohort study, involving nearly 800 patients — the largest patient series to date in the literature using ctDNA — found that 20%-30% of patients with PDAC have detectable mutant KRAS ctDNA in the blood and/or peritoneum, and that those without any previous treatment, such as chemotherapy, had the highest incidence. Thus, the study suggests that ctDNA assays should be performed prior to treatment to have the highest yield.</p>



<p>The researchers examined data between 2018 and 2022. Blood sample tests revealed that 104 patients (14%) had KRAS ctDNA mutation. These patients were more likely to develop advanced, spreading cancer and had a lower survival rate. Further testing of fluid from around the abdominal cavity in 419 patients showed similar results: 123 (29%) had the marker, and these patients also experienced worse outcomes. The presence of this marker, whether in blood or abdominal fluid, indicated a poorer prognosis.</p>



<p>The study highlights that while surgery is the only known cure, most patients experience cancer spread after surgery. The test helps identify patients less likely to benefit from surgery alone, guiding treatment decisions towards chemotherapy and/or radiation before surgery. For patients without the KRAS mutation (approximately 10% of cases), the test is less conclusive and other tests are needed.</p>



<p>"Historically, we've known that KRAS mutations are associated with a more biologically aggressive pancreatic cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leiting-jennifer-l-m-d/bio-20579694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer Leiting, M.D.</a>, hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgeon within Mayo Clinic's Department of Surgery. Dr. Leiting is first author of the study. "But this large study gives us a much clearer understanding of how to interpret the test results and use them to improve patient care. It allows for more accurate staging at diagnosis, leading to better treatment decisions."</p>



<p>The researchers suggest that this test should become a standard part of the initial diagnosis for PDAC, enabling more personalized risk stratification and effective treatment plans.</p>



<p>"This improved diagnostic capability offers hope for patients and their families facing this challenging disease," says Dr. Truty. "It's optimistic to see how advances in genetic testing are directly helping our patients."</p>

<p>Every rare disease tells a story. Understanding how one unfolds&amp;nbsp;— how it&amp;nbsp;develops and evolves — is often the first step toward treating it. A small genetic error, a malfunctioning cell or a breakdown in a biological process can set disease in motion. But for many rare conditions, the course of progression remains unwritten.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>A groundbreaking natural history study led by researchers at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a> and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-clinical-genomics-research/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Clinical Genomics</a> aims to change that, advancing research for one rare disease with the potential to benefit many others.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At the center of this effort is autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, a rare, hereditary neurodegenerative disorder. It is driven by a single genetic variant that causes an abnormal buildup of a protein. This disrupts nerve cell function and the brain's signaling network. Over time, this damage leads to a slow decline in movement, balance and essential body functions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A road map for research and treatment</strong></h2>



<p>This extensive study will track the disease from its earliest stages to advanced progression in patients from around the world. By analyzing patient medical records, brain imaging scans, genetic data, neurological assessments and more, researchers will develop a comprehensive dataset to identify key biological markers in people with the disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These insights will serve as a foundation for future clinical trials.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Genetic therapies are increasingly becoming a reality for rare diseases, providing hope of a treatment that can address the root cause of the disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cousin-margot-a-ph-d/bio-20503541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Margot Cousin, Ph.D.</a>, the study's lead investigator and director of the Center for Individualized Medicine's N-of-1 Therapeutics program. "We need to have systems in place to study these disorders so we can bring these therapies into clinical practice efficiently."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What makes this disease so challenging?</strong></h2>



<p>Autosomal dominant leukodystrophy is classified as an ultra-rare disease, meaning it affects a small number of people worldwide. Fewer than 50 families have been identified, but researchers believe many cases go undiagnosed due to its similarities to other neurological conditions and limited access to genetic testing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Because it is so rare, most clinicians will never encounter a patient with autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD). When they do, the disease can be difficult to recognize, as its symptoms resemble other neurological disorders that affect the brain's protective nerve coating. This often leads to misdiagnosis and delays in care.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Further, the type of genetic alteration that causes autosomal dominant leukodystrophy may not be detected using some common genetic testing methodologies, putting even more importance on the clinical recognition of the disease. Researchers emphasize the need to increase awareness of the disease among neurologists to help patients receive an accurate diagnosis sooner.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the study works</strong></h2>



<p>This natural history study is a collaboration with Children's Hospital of Philadelphia through the <a href="https://theglia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Leukodystrophy Initiative</a>. This initiative has extensive expertise and infrastructure needed to capture and analyze data on autosomal dominant leukodystrophy at depth.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers are working within this collaboration to improve how the disease is studied and to ensure data collection meets the highest clinical research standards. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><br>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A discovery by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers may help explain why immunotherapy hasn't been helpful for many patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In findings published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-0853/751983/Spatially-resolved-multi-region-proteomics-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Cancer Research</a>, the team identified specific proteins — fibronectin and smooth muscle actin — within colorectal cancer tissues that are associated with resistance to immunotherapy treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2025/02/26/what-is-cancer-immunotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immunotherapy</a> is a major advance in treating cancer, but many patients, including those with metastatic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>, do not respond to it. Until now, researchers have not known why.</p>



<p>"We need predictive biomarkers to guide the selection of immunotherapy for patients," says medical oncologist and gastroenterologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, the senior author of the study. "Identifying those who may have resistance to treatment can be useful, because then we can spare them from receiving treatment that may not be beneficial and could produce significant toxicities."</p>



<p>The research team used <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/spatial-biology-puts-potential-disease-targets-in-their-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital spatial profiling</a>, an advanced technology that simultaneously analyzes the expression of multiple proteins and where they are located within tissues. This approach allowed researchers to zoom in to get a bird's eye view of a tumor that includes proteins both within and surrounding the tumor cells and how they interact.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope compares the spatial tools to an aerial view of a neighborhood where one can see relationships between driveways, houses, yards and neighboring structures. Similarly, this detailed view provides physicians and researchers with critical information about the proteins in and around a patient's cancer, potentially informing the best treatment for the patient.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We wanted to learn more about the patients who did not respond to immunotherapy. We investigated the leading edge of the tumor where cancer cells are invading and where the immune system is attempting to fight the cancer," says Dr. Sinicrope. "It's like a battle going on here and we're getting a snapshot into who is in attendance."</p>



<p>The researchers focused on 10 regions at the invasive margin of a tumor. They applied digital spatial profiling to investigate 71 distinct proteins in both the tumor's epithelial compartment and the surrounding stromal compartment. Fibronectin and smooth muscle actin are two extracellular matrix proteins that were found in the epithelial region of the tumor and were associated with resistance to immunotherapy and shorter time before disease progression.</p>



<p>Upon further analysis, the researchers observed that cancer-associated fibroblasts were producing these proteins. The evidence, they say, suggests that these proteins can contribute to suppression of the anti-tumor immune response.</p>



<p>The discovery offers a step toward more personalized and effective colorectal cancer treatments. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Location, location, location" may be a familiar mantra in real estate, but in the world of biology, it's proving just as essential. Spatial biology is a rapidly evolving field that maps the precise location of molecules within cells and tissues. It is changing the way biomedical research is conducted, spurring advances in our understanding of health and disease.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/TamasOrdog.jpg" alt="Photo of Tamas Ordog, M.D." class="wp-image-400625" style="width:168px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/TamasOrdog.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/TamasOrdog-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tamas Ordog, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Spatial biology allows us to study how the local environment influences cellular interactions and behavior," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ordog-tamas-m-d/bio-00095251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tamas Ordog, M.D.</a>, professor of physiology at Mayo Clinic and director of the <a href="https://intranet.mayo.edu/charlie/spatial-multiomics-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spatial Multiomics Core</a>. "In all honesty, you can hardly find a problem in biology and medicine that is not a spatial problem."</p>



<p>Unlike traditional methods that analyze biological samples in bulk or as single cells, spatial biology uses sophisticated techniques to study molecules in their natural context. The approach marries old-school histology methods involving stains and microscopy with modern-day tools like sequencing and mass spectrometry.</p>



<p>For example, researchers can attach unique molecular <a>"</a>barcodes" to specific targets, such as RNA or proteins, while preserving their position within the architecture of the tissue. They then use high-resolution fluorescent microscopy to "read out" the barcodes to identify the tagged molecules at their location.</p>



<p>Alternatively, they can incorporate location barcodes into the "libraries" of molecules collected from the histological specimens, allowing the simultaneous detection of the targeted RNA or proteins and their location by sequencing. They then decode the barcodes associated with the molecules and combine that information with the spatial data to create maps showing how the molecules are spread across the tissue.</p>



<p>Dr. Ordog says he and his team often refer to their work as "spatial multi-omics" because it integrates multiple layers of "omics" data (such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) with spatial information.</p>



<p>"Soon, we will be able to generate an insane amount of information within a very short time with the technologies out there," he says.</p>



<p>This information — which charts where specific molecules are located and how they interact in space — gives scientists a much more detailed, dynamic view of biology. It's particularly transformative in studying diseases like cancer, where the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in disease progression and treatment response.</p>



<p>"Cancer is often a mass of tissue, and the cells that sit inside can behave quite differently depending on whether the tumor is infiltrated by immune cells or only surrounded by them," says Dr. Ordog. "Spatial biology can help us interrogate these interactions."</p>



<p>This emerging discipline can also help researchers tease apart the multiple cell types that make up atherosclerotic plaques, a key feature in the development of cardiovascular disease. And, in the case of Dr. Ordog's own research, it can give insight into how cell-to-cell interactions give rise to diabetic complications of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>



<p>"In diabetes, metabolic dysfunction influences various regulatory cells in the muscle layer of the gut," he says. "We can use spatial biology to assess which cells are more prone to metabolic damage than others."</p>



<p>By revealing how cellular environments shape various biological processes, Dr. Ordog says spatial biology can contribute to the understanding of disease and lead to more precise, personalized medical treatments.</p>



<p>"We can apply these sophisticated discovery techniques to routine patient samples, and in this way shorten the time it takes to translate basic research findings into advances in clinical care," he says.</p>

<p>Through the analysis, Dr. Jentzer and his colleagues identified five distinct groups, including patients with evidence of iron deficiency, kidney dysfunction, inflammation and poor blood flow. Each group had unique characteristics and risk profiles. Researchers underscore that by identifying these distinct groups, clinicians can craft treatment plans for each patient's needs and help to enhance outcomes and overall quality of care.</p>



<p>The groups in the study included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Uncomplicated:</strong> Patients generally had milder disease.</li>



<li><strong>Iron-deficient:</strong> Signs of iron deficiency, which can significantly impact heart function.</li>



<li><strong>Cardiorenal:</strong> Patients showed signs of kidney dysfunction, which is a common complication of severe heart failure.</li>



<li><strong>Inflamed:</strong> Patients revealed signs of significant inflammation.</li>



<li><strong>Hypoperfused:</strong> Patients showed signs of poor blood flow to vital organs, indicating more severe heart failure.</li>
</ul>



<p>The findings revealed that the patients in the uncomplicated group generally had the best outcomes. In contrast, the patients in the inflamed, cardiorenal and iron-deficient groups all had an intermediate mortality risk.</p>



<p>Researchers note that patients in the hypoperfused group had the highest risk of mortality.</p>



<p>"The phenotypes and subgroups based on patterns of laboratory findings identified in this study have not been described before and could represent different noncardiac organ complications driven by different underlying biologic processes," says Dr. Jentzer. "This may help identify unique targeted therapies in a future study."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674925001228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;sought to understand the connection between a mother and son's health conditions and, along the way, discovered a broader implication for patients suffering from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-immunodeficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20376905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunodeficiencies</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers revealed what appeared to be two separate health conditions — a mother's cancer and her son's persistent viral infections — stemmed from a single, shared genetic variant in what is known as the IRF8 gene, an important component of the immune system.</p>



<p>On the surface, the son's and mother's clinical presentations appeared worlds apart. The son had a persistent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mononucleosis/expert-answers/mononucleosis/faq-20058444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epstein-Barr virus</a> infection along with numerous respiratory issues, whereas the mother had developed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a>-related cancer.</p>



<p>Typically, the son would have been seen by infectious disease and pulmonary specialists while the mother would have gone to a gynecologist, with hardly any chance of professionals seeing a connection between the two and their respective conditions.</p>



<p>However, the boy's case, coupled with the discovery that his mother shared the same IRF8 variant and had developed an HPV-related tumor, sparked a deeper investigation among physicians and researchers at Mayo Clinic. Two Mayo clinicians, Thomas Boyce, M.D., initially, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ristagno-elizabeth-h-m-d/bio-20448052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Ristagno, M.D.</a>, subsequently were instrumental in acting as a bridge between the practice and research in this case.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/1622954_3876543_0055.jpg" alt="Photo of Amir Sadighi Akha, M.D., D.Phil." class="wp-image-400668" style="width:184px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/1622954_3876543_0055.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/1622954_3876543_0055-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amir Sadighi Akha, M.D., D.Phil.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Finding the variant and proving its effect on the patients' immune systems made it clear that their different clinical manifestations had the same underlying biological cause," says Amir Sadighi Akha, M.D., D.Phil., a consultant and laboratory director at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic</a>, the co-senior author of the study. "In a way, our findings gave their condition a name."</p>



<p>Researchers emphasized the importance of team science in this achievement and that no single group has the expertise to tackle a study like this alone.</p>



<p>In this respect, the work done by a group led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Immunology and co-senior author of the paper, was crucial to understanding how this variant carries out its effects, says Dr. Sadighi Akha.</p>

<p>"Working on immunodeficiencies is exciting and challenging at the same time, particularly when the disease under study is extremely rare, such as this one," Dr. Billadeau says. "The only way to do it is through concerted efforts by physicians and scientists in different disciplines, as was the case here."</p>



<p>"The more we did, the more the effect of this genetic variant came into focus, and the more excited we became," Dr. Sadighi Akha says.</p>



<p>They underscore that the more people know about these diseases and their consequences, the more beneficial it could be to both patients and the broader understanding of immunological diseases, including how they lead to increased risk of infections and cancers.</p>



<p>They note that the methods used in this study and its findings could help identify other cases of immunodeficiency and play a role in deciding how best to treat them.</p>



<p>They also believe that Mayo Clinic is among a select group of institutions that can undertake this type of work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona will reimagine the healthcare experience for patients and staff and expand clinical space on the Phoenix campus by nearly 60%</strong></p>



<p>PHOENIX — Today, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announced a nearly $1.9 billion investment in the continued transformation of its <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix campus</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mayo-clinic_boldforwardunbound-activity-7178404334513115137-Kx0y?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAABwoiTIBzY17D8a6Q3RNtn4GbvE-QYUZDCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bold. Forward.</a> strategy to Cure, Connect and Transform healthcare for the benefit of patients everywhere.</p>



<p>Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona will enable new innovative care concepts, physical spaces and integrated technologies to create seamless care experiences for patients and a better workplace for staff.</p>



<p>Mayo’s largest investment in the state, Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona underscores Mayo Clinic's leadership in creating a next-generation healthcare model that scales solutions for more patients when and where they need them. By harnessing the power of innovative technology and integrating physical and digital care, Mayo Clinic aims to deliver more cures, improve patient outcomes and elevate the patient experience.</p>



<p>"Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona is the final major building block of Bold. Forward. Unbound., our complete reimagining of our physical infrastructure to enable all of Bold. Forward.," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farrugia-gianrico-m-d/bio-20053394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gianrico Farrugia, M.D.</a>, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic. "Through this work, we are physically and digitally transforming healthcare and blurring the lines between inpatient and outpatient care to support Category-of-One healthcare for our patients, a Category-of-One workplace for our staff and to serve as a blueprint for the world."</p>



<p>This 1.2-million-square-foot expansion includes the construction of a new procedural building, a four-floor vertical and horizontal expansion of the Mayo Clinic Specialty Building, the integration of leading-edge technology, the addition of 11 new operating rooms and two new patient units supporting 48 additional beds, and an enhanced arrival experience for patients and visitors.</p>



<p>The plan calls for a two-story, indoor promenade that wraps around the front of the campus, creating cohesion and convenience for patients and visitors as they move from building to building. Another prominent feature in the new design will be the development of care neighborhoods that cluster complementary clinical services for a more intuitive and connected patient experience.</p>

<p>In 1931, Dr. William J. Mayo observed, "Each day, as I go through the hospitals surrounded by younger men [and women], they give me of their dreams and I give them of my experience, and I get the better of the exchange."</p>



<p>Nearly a century later, these sentiments still ring true. Residents and fellows not only uphold the values of Mayo Clinic but also have an immeasurable influence on patient care, research, education and the communities where they train. As Mayo Clinic marks National Thank a Resident and Fellow Day on Friday, Feb. 28, it recognizes the countless contributions that its residents and fellows make.</p>



<p>"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the residents and fellows who have entrusted us with their training. These professionals represent our future workforce," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sadosty-annie-t-m-d/bio-20054407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Sadosty, M.D.</a>, dean of the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education (MCGSME)</a>. "Graduate medical education is essential to what we do at Mayo Clinic, and we appreciate the commitment and compassion that our trainees bring to our institution. Every day, but especially today, we want to tell our residents and fellows 'Thank you for all that you do.'"</p>



<p>MCSGME's residents and fellows don't just make a mark in our hospitals, they deliver the Mayo Model of Care to their local communities and beyond through service learning and volunteering.</p>



<p>Here is what some local leaders had to say about our residents:</p>

Thirty years later, the residents who volunteer at the Good Sam remain essential. They provide care our patients wouldn't be able to access anywhere else.

We are so grateful to the many residents who have volunteered, and who currently volunteer, to make our clinic a place of refuge for thousands in need of healthcare.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.</p>



<p>The protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.</p>



<p>"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study, detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11829009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>. "This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer."</p>



<p>T cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.</p>



<p>There are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:</p>



<p>CAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.</p>



<p>NKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic <a href="http://10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/10/2/162/678013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tudy</a> had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.</p>



<p>Dr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-383780" style="width:218px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-196x300.jpg 196w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD.jpg 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells," says Dr. Billadeau. "We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression."</p>



<p>The manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.</p>
