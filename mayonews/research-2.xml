<p>Researchers at Mayo Clinic have discovered how high levels of triglycerides, a type of fat found in the bloodstream, can rapidly damage organs during acute pancreatitis. They discovered in pancreatitis that circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Blocking this breakdown prevented such damage from occurring.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/184785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, open a new therapeutic avenue for treating pancreatitis by halting the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="600" height="720" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396303" style="width:251px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh.jpg 600w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vijay Singh, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This discovery not only provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind triglyceride-induced organ damage in pancreatitis but also offers a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/singh-vijay-p-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20111292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Singh, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>



<p>Acute <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatitis</a> is a common gastrointestinal disorder that leads to approximately 275,000 hospital admissions annually in the U.S. alone. &nbsp;An estimated 30% of patients with acute pancreatitis have a form of the disease marked by high levels of triglycerides.</p>



<p>Patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis have a higher risk of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=pubmed&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;list_uids=37461868&amp;amp;query_hl=11&amp;amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persistent organ failure and severe pancreatitis</a>, which often requires life support, prolongs hospitalization and increases mortality rates. Despite these severe outcomes, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36599412/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanisms</a> driving this form of acute pancreatitis have remained unclear until now.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers analyzed triglyceride and fatty acid levels in blood samples from 269 patients with acute pancreatitis. They found that patients with very high triglycerides had more severe disease and higher levels of fatty acids.</p>



<p>In addition, they did experiments in preclinical models to see how metabolizing triglycerides into fatty acids affected organ health. In animals, this process led to organ failure, which could be prevented by blocking an enzyme called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917686/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lipase</a>, which plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="837" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-837x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396305" style="width:365px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-837x1024.jpg 837w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-245x300.jpg 245w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-768x939.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-1256x1536.jpg 1256w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-1675x2048.jpg 1675w" sizes="(max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In pancreatitis, circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Illustration: Renee Cannon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The finding could inform new ways to manage triglyceride elevation during pancreatitis. Current treatments, such as the use of the blood thinner heparin to reduce triglycerides, have shown minimal benefit in reducing organ damage or the severity of pancreatitis. Heparin works by breaking down triglycerides, but this process does not significantly improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by Dr. Singh, are currently developing alternative therapies for acute pancreatitis that block the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>



<p>The recent study also sheds light on the implications of using heparin and other treatments that release the enzyme lipase. It found that the worst outcomes were observed in pancreatitis patients receiving nutrition via IV, as intravenous formulations containing triglycerides can be broken down to potentially harmful fatty acids by circulating lipases. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team is now investigating the relevance of this finding in patients with elevated lipase levels due to other diseases, such as intestinal, heart and lung conditions. These diseases may silently damage the pancreas, causing it to leak lipase and create a vicious cycle of worsening organ damage.</p>



<p>"Preliminary studies suggest that patients with elevated triglycerides and lipase levels require more frequent admissions to the intensive care unit," says Dr. Singh. "If confirmed, these findings could point to new ways to prevent the progression of these diseases."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A study at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that an hourglass-shaped stent could improve blood flow and ease severe and reoccurring chest pain in people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-vessel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microvascular disease</a>. Of 30 participants in a phase 2 clinical trial, 76% saw improvement in their day-to-day life. For example, some participants who reported not being able to walk around the block or up a flight of stairs without chest pain were able to do these ordinary physical activities at the end of a 120-day period. Clinical measures of blood flow related to the microvasculature of the heart significantly improved during follow-up, according to findings published in the <a href="https://authors.elsevier.com/a/1k39I6uPJvuWBq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American College of Cardiology: Cardiovascular Interventions</a>.</p>



<p>Microvascular disease is a condition in which tiny blood vessels in the heart are not working properly, resulting in reduced blood flow to the heart. The resulting chest pains, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">angina</a>, can be debilitating, limiting a person's ability to exercise, do household chores or even walk to the mailbox. About 40% of patients receiving a diagnostic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/coronary-angiogram/about/pac-20384904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary angiogram</a> for chest pain do not have blocked arteries that also can cause angina. However, up to 66% of these patients do have coronary microvascular disease, which is more common in women overall and found in people with conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.</p>



<p>For decades, there have been few viable treatment options to improve blood flow through the tiny vessels of the heart. At most, doctors have treated symptoms of angina with several medications and cardiovascular disease prevention methods, including healthy eating, weight loss and regular exercise. The use of a stent could target the issue behind the chest pain — the severe reduction in blood flow affecting the heart muscle.</p>



<p>Unlike tube-shaped stents used to open clogged arteries, the hourglass-shaped stent narrows in the middle. The different design is thought to increase back pressure, redistributing blood flow more fully through small vessels in the heart that were not working at capacity.</p>

<p>"The patients with heart-related microvascular dysfunction in this study had little ability to control their chronic angina, which severely limited their day-to-day activities," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lerman-amir-m-d/bio-00078051" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amir Lerman, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "Beyond reductions in chest pain and being able to comfortably handle more physical activity, the majority of patients in the study also showed a connection between the changes in their coronary flow reserve, which is a measure of maximum blood flow, and changes in their quality-of-life responses on the survey. This points to the link between the physiological measurement and angina symptoms."</p>



<p>Dr. Lerman notes that more studies are needed to better understand how the reducer stent works and its long-term effects on blood flow. The stent did not improve chest pain symptoms in 20%-30% of the participants, so future research studies will need to better identify which patients respond best to this therapy. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

Additionally, many studies have now shown that there are health benefits to keeping the uterus and the ovaries," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/laughlin-tommaso-shannon-k-m-d/bio-00112295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannon Laughlin-Tommaso, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic OB-GYN and co-lead author of the paper.</p>



<p>Removing the uterus, even while sparing the ovaries, increases the risks of cardiovascular disease, depression, anxiety and higher mortality. These risks are higher for people who get their uteruses removed at a young age.</p>



<p>"Women contemplating a hysterectomy deserve counseling about these risks since there are other less invasive options for many women with fibroids," Dr. Laughlin-Tommaso says.</p>



<p>A recent study found that nearly 60% of women undergoing hysterectomy for fibroids had not received a less invasive treatment first. Having alternative options to hysterectomy allow women to maintain their uteruses for longer.</p>



<p>These alternatives include <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-treatment-for-uterine-fibroids-without-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical therapies</a>, hormone-releasing IUDs, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-nonsurgical-treatment-for-uterine-fibroids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiofrequency ablation</a>, focused ultrasound ablation and uterine artery embolization.</p>



<p>Early detection is key. When fibroids are found early, they tend to be smaller and less extensive. As a result, treating them early is medically less complicated.</p>



<p>The incidence of fibroids increases with age until menopause and is higher among Black women.&amp;nbsp;In addition, this population often presents with more severe fibroids.</p>

<p>"Earlier diagnosis and treatment of uterine fibroids can help reduce this health disparity among Black women," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stewart-ebbie-a-m-d/bio-00095802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ebbie Stewart, M.D.</a>, co-lead author and Mayo Clinic gynecologist and reproductive endocrinologist. In <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38610011/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey-based studies</a>, many Black patients preferred minimally invasive therapies over hysterectomies.</p>



<p>Diagnosing fibroids is straightforward with a pelvic ultrasound but determining who to screen is not, and screening usually occurs after the fibroids are large or the patients are symptomatic. Many women with symptomatic fibroids have reported psychological suffering, including depression, concern, anger and body image distress.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers suggest that future studies should include screening younger women, particularly young Black women, and people with a strong family health history of fibroids to determine if early treatment reduces long-term risks.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Why a hysterectomy?</h2>



<p>Hysterectomies have been the most common treatment for uterine fibroids for several reasons.</p>



<p>"Hysterectomy makes decision-making easier for medical providers and patients. For providers, they don't have to determine which fibroids to treat or remove. Hysterectomy is also universally available in OB-GYN practices," explains Dr. Laughlin-Tommaso.</p>



<p>Additionally, concerns about inadvertently missing a rare cancer that grows in the smooth muscle of the uterus, known as leiomyosarcoma, has led to an increased rate of hysterectomies over less invasive approaches.</p>



<p>Lastly, a major reason for hysterectomy is that fibroids can recur about 50% of the time within five years after they are removed. However, the researchers note that not all new fibroids will become symptomatic, especially among women entering menopause.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed an innovative testing strategy for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mesothelioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20375022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mesothelioma</a> that could potentially increase the detection rate of cancer DNA in the blood. This approach focuses on shuffled or swapped sections of DNA in mesothelioma cancer cells, called chromosomal rearrangements.</p>



<p>By detecting these complex DNA patterns, rather than just single-point mutations, the method could lead to earlier diagnoses and new avenues for targeted therapies.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“We're pushing the frontiers of what's possible in blood-based monitoring," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mansfield-aaron-s-m-d/bio-20116851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Mansfield, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist and lead author of the study at the Center for Individualized Medicine and the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "Improving detection rates could offer insights into monitoring patients' responses to therapy and detecting recurrence after surgery."&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/MANSFIELD.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396040" style="width:224px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/MANSFIELD.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/MANSFIELD-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Aaron Mansfield, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mesothelioma is a rare cancer that develops in the thin membranes that line the chest and abdomen, most commonly caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. These fibers are often found in insulation, vinyl tiles, roofing materials and paint. Despite decades of regulations to limit asbestos exposure, approximately 3,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year, according to the American Cancer Society.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Mesothelioma typically exhibits a low number of single-point genetic mutations, making it difficult to detect with traditional blood tests. However, the presence of chromosomal rearrangements — like shuffling words in a sentence — provides a new diagnostic target. This differs from many other cancers that often rely on detecting single-point mutations — tiny changes in the DNA sequence, similar to altering a single letter in a word.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In the proof-of-concept <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364324000626?via%3Dihub">study</a>, published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology Clinical and Research Reports, Dr. Mansfield and his team used whole genome sequencing to locate key chromosomal changes in the DNA of cancer cells. Next, they created tiny pieces of DNA, called primers, that they designed in the lab to precisely match and attach to these chromosomal changes. They then searched for these changes in blood.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This combination of cutting-edge tools allowed the researchers to create personalized tests that detect and track cancer DNA in each patient's blood.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings build on the team's previous mesothelioma research, including a study that identified a genomic signature to predict which patients with mesothelioma could benefit from immunotherapy.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, Dr. Mansfield’s previous research shows how chromosomal rearrangements have neoantigenic potential, meaning they can help the body make an immune response against cancer cells.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team plans to expand this study to include more patients and further refine the testing method.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In his 18 months of life, Oliver Bates, with his soft red hair and big blue eyes, left an enduring legacy at Mayo Clinic. Oliver is remembered for his infectious smile and the love and resilience he radiated to all who knew him, even from the intensive care unit. Born with a rare and incurable genetic epilepsy disorder, he inspired a pioneering program designed to expedite genomic-related diagnoses and enhance definitive patient care.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Oliver's life was a brief gift, but he left a mark deeper than his time with us," says his mother, Justine Bates, sitting in the comforting glow of purple lights in honor of her baby boy. Those lights, adorning the windows and a memory tree in her Minnesota home, symbolize epilepsy awareness. Close to her heart, Justine has a tattoo of Oliver's small handprint.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Oliver's father, Casey Bates, will always remember the quiet evenings spent holding his son after work. He proudly displays his own tattoo that reads "Seize the day," a subtle nod to his son's seizure condition and a reminder to cherish every day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"He loved to laugh, and he had the best facial expressions. He was my snuggle bug," Casey says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oliver’s diagnostic journey</strong></h2>



<p>Oliver's health journey began when he was just five weeks old, when his first seizure led his parents to rush him to a local emergency room. The complexity of his case and the initial hospital's difficulty in diagnosing him led them to transfer Oliver to Mayo Clinic for specialized care. At Mayo, Oliver underwent a comprehensive series of tests, including exome sequencing, which specifically examines 20,000 protein-coding genes where many diseases originate. Although this sequencing technique can provide crucial insights into rare conditions, it can require time for detailed analysis and interpretation of the results.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While Oliver's initial tests did not reveal the cause of his ongoing seizures, the exome sequencing, which took nearly a month to process, finally helped his care team diagnose Oliver's condition: a rare form of epilepsy known as WWOX-related epileptic encephalopathy (WOREE syndrome). Although the diagnosis helped his care team guide Oliver's care, the condition currently has no cure. He passed away on March 10, 2022, surrounded by his loved ones.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new era in genomics</strong></h2>



<p>Rare diseases affect 300 million people worldwide, yet only about 25 percent of patients ever receive a diagnosis, and often that diagnosis has no available treatments. Recent advancements in genomic technologies are beginning to offer a glimmer of hope. Clinicians are using these cutting-edge tools, which leverage artificial intelligence (AI) to scour volumes of data, to transform diagnostics and make it possible to identify and understand rare diseases more quickly and accurately than ever before. This is opening avenues for the development of more treatments.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oliver inspires genomic advances</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="639" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/DR.THOMPSON-6-639x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-396066" style="width:428px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/DR.THOMPSON-6-639x1024.png 639w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/DR.THOMPSON-6-187x300.png 187w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/DR.THOMPSON-6-768x1230.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/DR.THOMPSON-6-959x1536.png 959w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/DR.THOMPSON-6.png 1040w" sizes="(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Thompson with Oliver Bates. Courtesy of the Bates family.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Witnessing firsthand the critical need for such advancements, Whitney Thompson, M.D., a key member of Oliver's care team, felt compelled to act, moved by Oliver's family's wait for a diagnosis. With support from the Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine and the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, she launched an ultra-rapid whole genome sequencing program in Mayo Clinic's neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In this pioneering program, which is a collaboration with Rady Children's Institute for Genomic Medicine, clinicians use new sophisticated technology and AI to sequence a patient's 3 billion DNA base pairs in approximately 48 hours. This comprehensive analysis can identify even the most subtle genetic variants, though it may not always lead to a diagnosis.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Rapid diagnoses can lead to lifesaving treatments in some cases, and while not every rare disease has a treatment, every diagnosis brings crucial information that can guide medical decisions and help families anticipate what’s next," says Dr. Thompson, who is completing her fellowship training in Neonatal Medicine, Clinical Genomics and Bioethics as part of the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/clinician-investigator-training-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinician Investigator Training Program at Mayo Clinic.</a>&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Under this program, through the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/clinical-genomics/sections/overview/ovc-20567367">Mayo Clinic Department of Clinical Genomics </a>with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lanpher-brendan-c-m-d/bio-20357409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brendan Lanpher, M.D.</a>, as practice chair, infants and children admitted to the Mayo Clinic's Eugenio Litta Children's Hospital in Minnesota undergo ultra-rapid whole genome sequencing if they meet specific criteria.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The program, launched at Mayo in June 2022, has since been expanded to some adults who exhibit symptoms suggestive of genetic disease, enabling them to receive the same rapid, comprehensive DNA analysis. To date, more than 300 infants, children and adults have been offered whole genome sequencing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Lanpher hopes the program will open the door to more patients having access to comprehensive genetic testing.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is the future of medicine," Dr. Lanpher says. "I believe there are many patients with unrecognized or undiagnosed genetic diseases, and by finding and testing these patients early in the course of symptoms, we'll have the best chance at making a difference, finding a treatment and avoiding a diagnostic odyssey."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Achieving a precision diagnosis is just the first step of a broader goal. Dr. Thompson and her team also have their sights set on rapid individualized therapeutics. She is collaborating with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lambert-laura-j-ph-d/bio-20545313">Laura Lambert, Ph.D.</a>, director of the Mayo Clinic Functional Omics Resource (FORce), along with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, the Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director of Research and Innovation at the Center for Individualized Medicine and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pinto-e-vairo-filippo-m-d-ph-d/bio-20503559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> director of the center's Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, they have initiated a first-of-its-kind program called BabyFORce, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/cracking-the-code-how-the-human-phenotype-ontology-advances-genetic-discovery/">which uses AI </a>to help clinicians identify individualized therapeutics for some of the smallest and sickest patients with genetic diseases in the neonatal intensive care unit.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We’re tapping into an advanced AI platform that leverages a 'logic programming' approach, applying set rules to combine and analyze various biomedical data sources," says Dr. Lambert. "This could enable researchers to identify potential drug repurposing opportunities, generate hypotheses and uncover novel insights into disease mechanisms."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>She says the approach could also reduce the time and cost associated with developing new therapies and provide hope for patients with limited treatment options.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oliver's impact on pediatric tele-hospice</strong></h2>



<p>Oliver's impact extends beyond medical advancements. As his care unfolded during the challenging times of COVID-19, he also inspired Mayo's pediatric palliative care team to start a tele-hospice program. This ensured that children in hospice care could continue to receive compassionate support remotely.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"All of the providers who cared for Oliver learned so much from him and his family, including how helpful it was to have real-time video assessment of patients with challenging pain and symptoms during in-home hospice visits by nurses," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/collura-christopher-a-m-d/bio-20387631">Christopher Collura, M.D</a>., the Medical Director of Pediatric Palliative Care (ComPASS) at Mayo. "This inspired our team to formalize a tele-hospice program in order to streamline assessments by pediatric palliative medicine physicians for children enrolled with Mayo Clinic Hospice."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Honoring Oliver and welcoming his baby sister</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout Oliver's life and even in his final hours, Dr. Thompson and her team formed a tight, supportive relationship with Oliver and his family, providing comfort and care when it was most needed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

Courtesy of the Bates family.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Dr. Thompson was really there for us during the hardest time of our lives. And she has continued to support us after Oliver's death," Justine says. "Every year she joins us to honor his memory at our balloon release on Oliver's birthday."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bates family also reached out to Dr. Thompson for guidance on the potential for having another child.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>WOREE syndrome, the genetic condition that affected Oliver, is a recessive disorder. That means both parents carry a copy of the mutated gene but usually show no symptoms. Each pregnancy has a 25% chance of the child inheriting two defective genes — one from each parent — which leads to the disease. Using these genetic insights, Dr. Thompson helped guide the Bates family to the subspecialists who helped them choose a plan that would increase the likelihood of a healthy pregnancy unaffected by the same genetic condition that Oliver had.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In May, Oliver's legacy was further celebrated with the birth of his baby sister. Justine and Casey named her Whitney, in tribute to Dr. Thompson, reflecting their deep gratitude for the care and dedication Dr. Thompson gave to Oliver and their family.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I am deeply touched by this gesture," Dr. Thompson says. "Oliver's story shows us that new beginnings can coexist with cherished memories to help provide healing and comfort."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shraddha's Story</strong></h2>



<p>It was November 2022, just a month shy of her 28th birthday.</p>



<p>Shraddha was wrapping up another day at the medical clinic where she worked as an occupational therapist. Shraddha's job was to help patients regain the ability to perform day-to-day activities following a health challenge like a surgery.</p>



<p>Suddenly that afternoon, Shraddha became the patient who needed help.</p>



<p>"My co-worker looked at me and said, 'Why is your hand all purple and blue?'" Shraddha says. She admits she had been feeling exceptionally tired as of late, but attributed it to a thyroid condition.</p>



<p>Her co-worker checked Shraddha's vital signs and found her blood oxygen level was dangerously low. "I remember her saying, 'If this is right, you wouldn't even be standing.'" A repeat test showed the same result. "The next thing I remember was we were on our way to the hospital," says Shraddha.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>At the hospital doctors began looking for the cause of Shraddha's low blood oxygen level.  A series of tests traced Shraddha's condition all the way back to the day she was born.</p>



<p>"When I was born, doctors said I had fatty liver, but they didn't know why so they called it 'undiagnosed,'" says Shraddha. "The doctors thought it wouldn't be a problem because the liver has a tendency to heal itself." It didn't. Shraddha grew up seemingly in perfect health, unaware that her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/the-silent-liver-disease-experts-warn-is-on-the-rise-among-hispanics-and-children/">liver disease</a> was silently doing damage to her body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A little girl with a big dream</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Shraddha was born in Mumbai, India which is often called the "City of Dreams." At a young age, Shraddha had big dreams of her own.  She wanted to pursue a career in the medical field that would allow her to help others. </p>



<p>Every year Shraddha went to the doctor for her routine physical. Each time she was given a clean bill of health. "I used to do blood tests, but everything always looked good," says Shraddha. Still, the question of what caused her congenital liver condition lingered in her mind.</p>



<p>"I didn't have a family history of any liver condition. I've never had alcohol in my life," says Shraddha. "There was always a question mark. I needed to find out why this happened to me."</p>



<p>At 23, Shraddha became the first person in her family to leave India and go to the U.S. to attend college. She studied occupational therapy and got her master's degree at the University of Southern California. After college, Shraddha found her dream job at a medical clinic in California.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">'<strong>You have less than a year to live</strong>'</h2>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="799" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Shraddha-sad-1024x799.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395512" style="width:719px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Shraddha-sad-1024x799.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Shraddha-sad-300x234.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Shraddha-sad-768x599.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Shraddha-sad-1536x1199.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Shraddha-sad.jpg 1848w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>All was going well until Shraddha began to noticed she was unusually tired. "When my sister came to visit she noticed I got tired after walking short distances. I went to the doctor and they thought maybe it was my thyroid," recalls Shraddha.</p>



<p>Then came the day her hands turned purple and her blood oxygen level mysteriously dropped. "My co-worker is a nurse so she got the oximeter and checked and it was 78%," says Shraddha. "And I was like, No, that's not possible because I wouldn't be alive." Shraddha's co-worker checked again, looked at the reading and said, "That's it, you have to go to the hospital."</p>



<p>A series of tests at the hospital revealed shocking results. Shraddha's liver condition had silently led to a more serious condition called hepatopulmonary syndrome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hepatopulmonary syndrome</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hepatopulmonary syndrome</a> is caused when liver disease shunts blood away from the lungs preventing the body from getting the appropriate amount of oxygen. Doctors told Shraddha the only way she would survive is with a liver transplant. However, she says she was told her condition was so severe and the risk so high, that she would likely not survive a transplant.</p>



<p>She was denied the transplant and given less than a year to live.</p>



<p>"I told the doctors 'that just can't be. I can't have just one year with nothing to bring to this world. I have not served my purpose,'" recalls Shraddha. </p>



<p>Refusing to give up, Shraddha turned to Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</p>



<p>"More than 40% of her blood was being shunted away from her lungs. Because of that she had extremely low oxygen levels in her blood," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20203899?customer_id=173-378-9621&amp;amp;mc_id=google&amp;amp;campaign=20718088499&amp;amp;geo=9030070&amp;amp;kw=transplant%20center%20arizona&amp;amp;ad=678670770145&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;sitetarget=&amp;amp;adgroup=158054873227&amp;amp;extension=&amp;amp;target=kwd-1284412548384&amp;amp;matchtype=p&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;account=1733789621&amp;amp;invsrc=transplant&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1bPG-JO5iQMVrjYIBR0f-AKlEAAYASAAEgKkU_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</a> "Shraddha's case was one of the most severe cases of liver disease and hepatopulmonary syndrome."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving Shraddha</strong></h2>



<p>The liver transplant was Shraddha's only hope for survival. "Without a transplant, this disease was progressive and fatal. We don't like to use this word, but it is a very progressive disease," says Dr. Aqel. "There was no other cure than a liver transplant."</p>



<p>Dr. Aqel and his multidisciplinary team of experts at Mayo Clinic went to work on a strategy to save Shraddha. The team came up with a plan using a combination of some of the latest cutting-edge technologies in medicine. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"<strong>Liver in a box</strong>"</h2>



<p>Transplanting any organ is a race agains the clock. Every second the donor organ is outside the body it begins to break down. Surgeons only have a limited time window to transplant the organ. Due to the complexity of Shraddha's case, Dr. Aqel's team knew they would need extra time. They decided to use one of the latest medical breakthroughs in transplant often referred to as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-liver-in-a-box-is-saving-lives-with-new-technology/">"liver in a box."</a></p>



<p>Traditionally donor organs are kept cold until transplanted. "Liver in a box" uses a warm organ preservation method. The organ is placed in a container that pumps oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood through the liver simulating conditions in the human body. The innovative perfusion system gives surgeons more time to perform the transplant. </p>



<p>"Having the donor "liver in a box" allowed the donor liver to stay healthy while we performed this complex surgery," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>Currently, this warm perfusion technology is primarily being used for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/heart-transplant-innovation-new-heart-in-a-box-technology-provides-gift-of-life-to-arizona-man-as-couple-prepares-to-celebrate-50-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart, lungs and liver transplants</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving lives with mobile ECMO</strong></h2>



<p>The next challenge was how to keep Shraddha's blood oxygen levels stable after her transplant. Dr. Aqel's team turned to a device called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/young-patient-with-covid-19-recovering-after-hospital-stay-ecmo-support/">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO</a>. The device often is used when the lungs aren't working properly. ECMO helps with the appropriate gas exchange that must occur to keep the body's blood oxygen level safe.</p>



<p>"It helps in getting oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood through the machine," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sen-ayan-m-d/bio-20055718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ayan Sen, M.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic's Intensive Care Unit in Arizona. "It helped us while her lungs recovered after her transplant."</p>



<p>The Mayo team also used one of the newest advancements in ECMO where the device is mobile. </p>

<p>"The best part of the mobile ECMO was that we do it in a way where she could actually walk around with the machine so that we could continue with her physical therapy, which is so important for the healing process after such a complex surgery," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Shraddha was in the ICU for nearly two months. With mobile ECMO she walked nearly every day.</p>



<p>Dr. Sen says mobile ECMO has proved to be a game-changer in critical cases like Shraddha's.</p>



<p>"It is technology that has really expanded from what surgeons do when they do heart surgeries and transplants where now we can do this to save lives at any place that is not a complex environment, like the ICU or the operating rooms," explains Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Mobile ECMO has become a lifesaving medical breakthrough for many patients.</p>

<p>"It has enabled us to raise the bar when it comes to saving people, who, until now, could not have been saved in the absence of this heart-lung machine," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>A team of highly specialized experts escorted Shraddha on her daily walks, meticulously monitoring her vital signs. Each step required Shraddha to muster every bit of strength she had.</p>



<p>"From the first day, I thought even if it pains me, if it hurts, even if it feels impossible, I still need to put that step forward to do something better today than yesterday," recalls Shraddha. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Mayo's mission is now my purpose'</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two years after her harrowing experience, Shraddha is healthy and back at work. She continues her daily walks, only now, at the beach, in solitude, reflecting on how her own experience can make her a better healthcare professional.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic doesn't like to say no. They set out to achieve the unachievable," says Shraddha. "My goal is to treat patients as they do, making them a priority."</p>



<p>Shraddha says words of thanks alone are not enough to convey her gratitude.</p>



<p>"Dr. Aqel and his team achieved something for me that everyone else thought was impossible," says Shraddha. "It was a gift. I will keep the mission of Mayo Clinic in mind when I am serving my patients. My purpose now is to put forward their purpose and help someone else."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Doctors at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> used a new catheter-based approach to draw out resistant pockets of infection that settle in the heart, known as right-sided <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endocarditis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352576" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infective endocarditis</a>, without surgery. Unless treated quickly, the walled-off infections can grow, severely damaging heart valves and potentially affecting other organs as well. In a recent study, over 90% of the participants had their infection cleared, and they had lower in-hospital mortality compared to those whose infections remained.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Abdallah-El-Sabbagh_WF119668_0001-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395747" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Abdallah-El-Sabbagh_WF119668_0001-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Abdallah-El-Sabbagh_WF119668_0001-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Abdallah-El-Sabbagh_WF119668_0001.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Abdallah El Sabbagh, M.D. </sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The research is part of a Mayo Clinic-led study across 19 U.S. sites involving patients who were not good candidates for surgery and whose right-sided heart infections had not responded to antibiotics. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/el-sabbagh-abdallah-m-d/bio-20466764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abdallah El Sabbagh, M.D.</a>, an interventional cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, was the study's principal investigator. Dr. El Sabbagh presented late-breaking research findings at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics Symposium on Oct. 30.</p>



<p>High-risk patients have few treatment options when a&amp;nbsp;serious infection becomes entrenched in a heart valve. People with weakened immune systems, such as those who have had a transplant or cancer treatment, are more susceptible to such infections. IV drug users and patients with implanted medical devices such as pacemakers and artificial heart valves are also more likely to develop infective endocarditis. Approximately half of the 285 study participants were people who inject IV drugs.</p>



<p>"Our research findings show that using a catheter to draw out most of the heart infection potentially made a significant difference in a patient's response to antibiotic therapy afterward to clear up the infection. The participants in this study were all high-risk patients, and most were not responding to antibiotic therapy alone and were considered to have significant risks with open heart surgery. We were able to show that minimally invasive catheter-based aspiration of the infection is feasible, successful and may help a significant population of patients who otherwise have no alternative therapeutic options," says Dr. El Sabbagh.</p>



<p>The catheter-based system was originally developed to remove blood clots from the lungs without surgery. While its off-label use for infective endocarditis shows potential as a safe and effective option, Dr. El Sabbagh notes that further prospective study is needed. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Lifesaving cancer therapies can cause serious side effects, both immediately and later in life. "It is essential to continue to study innovative approaches that will eradicate the disease but won't diminish the quality of life for patients diagnosed with cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic. With breast cancer rates rising among younger people, the need for treatments that provide excellent outcomes with fewer side effects is only increasing.</p>

<p>Dr. Leon-Ferre's research team <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently</a> identified a prognostic biomarker in patients diagnosed with <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)</a>, a type of breast cancer that does not have estrogen or progesterone receptors and that does not have excessive expression of HER2. The researchers found that patients with high levels of naturally existing immune cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within their tumors may have a lower risk of cancer recurrence and better survival rates, even when chemotherapy is not administered.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because triple-negative breast cancer is a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer that does not respond to hormonal therapies or drugs targeting the HER2 protein," says Dr. Leon-Ferre. "This means treatment options are more limited, often more intense and harsher for patients. However, some patients with TNBC can be cured without chemotherapy, and the key is identifying who those patients are ahead of time." He adds that future research will explore whether TILs can be used to decide who may need and may not need chemotherapy after a TNBC diagnosis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Study Explores Necessity of Chemotherapy in Premenopausal Women with Intermediate-Risk Breast Cancer</h2>



<p>In a separate ongoing trial, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/haddad-tufia-c-m-d/bio-10029575" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufia Haddad, M.D.</a>, breast medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic, is co-chair of a <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerres/article/84/9_Supplement/PO2-19-02/744254/Abstract-PO2-19-02-NRG-BR009-Phase-III-Trial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> comparing two treatment regimens in premenopausal women with intermediate-risk breast cancer: one group with chemotherapy plus ovarian suppression and hormone therapy, and another group without chemotherapy but with ovarian suppression and hormone therapy. The study aims to determine whether chemotherapy's benefits come from its ability to suppress ovarian function (thereby reducing estrogen production) or from its direct cancer-fighting effects. "The results could determine if chemotherapy is necessary or if ovarian suppression and hormone therapy alone are enough in this group of patients, sparing them from the side effects of chemotherapy," says Dr. Haddad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Endoxifen: A Potent Therapy for Estrogen-Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer Explored by Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist and director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/research-programs/womens-cancer-program/breast-cancer-spore/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer Specialized Programs of Research Excellence (SPORE)</a>, and the Erivan K. Haub Family Professor of Cancer Research Honoring Richard F. Emslander, M.D., has spent more than a decade studying the use of endoxifen for the treatment of patients with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer (ER-positive breast cancer or ER+), the most common subtype of breast cancer.</p>



<p>Endoxifen, the most potent byproduct of tamoxifen, stops the growth of estrogen-dependent cancer cells and blocks protein kinase C, which may contribute to the aggressiveness of some cancers. Premenopausal patients with ER+ breast cancer are treated with ovarian function suppression and aromatase inhibitors to lower estrogen levels and slow cancer growth. While effective, this regimen causes significant side effects from deep estrogen suppression. Dr. Goetz's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/specialized-programs-research-excellence-spore-grants/breast-cancer/research-projects/improving-endocrine-management-premenopausal-er-her2-breast-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SPORE-funded study</a> explores whether endoxifen alone can eradicate cancer cells, potentially eliminating the need for more toxic treatments like chemotherapy. He is also studying the role of protein kinase C in ER+ breast cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic Study Finds Shortened and Less Intense Radiation Therapy Effective for Breast Cancer Patients</h2>



<p>Radiation therapy can be an essential part of a person's breast cancer treatment plan; however, it can lead to changes in the appearance of the skin, swelling, pain and other complications. These side effects can be detrimental to a patient's quality of life. In a recent <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360301624033893?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic breast cancer researchers found they can safely reduce the intensity and shorten the course of radiation treatment to three days for select patients with breast cancer following their lumpectomy.</p>



<p>"Normally, this treatment takes five to 15 days and can sometimes cause unwanted side effects, including changes in how the breast looks. However, this new method administers a lower dose of radiation over just three sessions using either photons, protons or brachytherapy," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mutter-robert-w-m-d/bio-20343551" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert Mutter, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist and lead author of the study. "The new personalized approach was well-tolerated by the patients and resulted in excellent cancer control with better long-term aesthetic results compared to what has previously been reported with longer treatments."</p>



<p>Collectively, this research is leading to innovative approaches and helping clinicians and patients make informed treatment decisions, potentially sparing patients from some of the more severe side effects of chemotherapy, endocrine therapy and radiation.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-video"><video autoplay controls loop muted src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/digital-data.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Inside every person are nearly 3 billion DNA base pairs, trillions of cells and microbes, thousands of genes and hundreds of thousands of proteins and other key molecules — a vast collection of data holding clues to health and disease.</p>



<p>At <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, a digital transformation is equipping clinicians with tools to analyze this data and unlock critical insights for patient care. This advancement has the potential to enhance diagnoses and treatments and improve overall patient outcomes.</p>



<p>This shift is expanding the focus beyond traditional measures like blood pressure and cholesterol.&amp;nbsp;Clinicians and scientists are now exploring genetics (genomics) to understand DNA; proteins (proteomics) that drive cellular functions; chemical changes (metabolomics) that reveal how the body responds to diet and environment, along with other biological characteristics. Together, these details provide a fuller picture of a person’s health.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Each patient’s dataset is massive, containing layers of information that reveal how the body functions at a deeper level. When analyzed collectively, these elements help experts identify patterns and gain new insights into health and disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But gathering this data is only the beginning. As these datasets grow larger and more complex, Mayo's experts are developing and leveraging digital tools to transform raw data into actionable insights.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Digital Omics powers precision medicine</strong></h2>



<p>Leading these efforts is Mayo Clinic's Digital Omics pillar team, co-directed by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.,</a> the center's Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director, Research and Innovation.  "Omics" refers to the characterization and counting of different biological components — such as genomics, proteomics and metabolomics — and how they are interconnected to influence health.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/WF2421762_0152.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395590" style="width:199px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/WF2421762_0152.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/WF2421762_0152-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We're giving clinicians the tools they need to connect the dots and make the right decisions for patients," Dr. Klee says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>One of their key innovations is the Omics Data Platform, a digital library housed in the Mayo Clinic Cloud, which safely stores and organizes the omics data so clinicians and researchers can quickly access this valuable resource. It has reduced many of the barriers to access and created a fast and reliable method for omics data exploration. With tools like the Omics Data Explorer, clinicians can investigate genetic data and quickly identify new insights into the nature of disease. This can potentially lead to faster diagnoses and more targeted treatment options.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also developed a tool called SAVI PI to help doctors and researchers interpret inherited genetic variation and better understand how specific genes may influence a patient's condition. Another Mayo-built platform, MINERVA, links genetic data with clinical information. This allows researchers and clinicians to explore the relationship between genetic variation and patient traits.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of Mayo Clinic's commitment to responsible data stewardship, leaders are working to form an omics data subcommittee to oversee how genomic data is managed and used. The subcommittee will establish clear guidelines so all stakeholders understand their responsibilities for data access and usage. This framework will enhance collaboration, protect patient privacy and ensure ethical data use in research and clinical settings.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To support clinical data integration, Dr. Klee and his team have launched a "roadshow" to introduce these SAVI PI and&amp;nbsp;MINERVA&amp;nbsp;digital tools to medical and research teams across Mayo Clinic. Through demonstrations and hands-on sessions, they show how the platforms can help them streamline data access and support better patient care.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing patient care with AI-driven tools</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Meanwhile, Cherisse Marcou, Ph.D., co-director of the center's Digital Omics Program and co-director and vice chair of Information Technology and Bioinformatics in the Clinical Genomics Laboratory, is focused on bringing these advancements directly into patient care. Her team has created an artificial intelligence-driven tool that helps specialists simplify genomic test selection and accelerate genomic data analysis and interpretation. &amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="442" height="278" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/MARCOU.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395583" style="width:495px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/MARCOU.jpg 442w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/MARCOU-300x189.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 442px) 100vw, 442px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Cherisse Marcou, Ph.D., presents her research at the Individualizing Medicine Conference, Sept. 2024.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Known as the&amp;nbsp;Genetic Optimization and Appropriateness of Testing Tool, or GOATT, this innovation is used by laboratory experts to automate the summarization of important and relevant patient information across the electronic medical record into a concise format. Access to this comprehensive patient clinical summary helps ensure that the right test is ordered for the right patient at the right time. Ultimately, it enables more complete and personalized analysis and interpretation of complex genomic results.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Marcou also collaborates closely with clinicians and laboratorians to integrate complex genomic data into Mayo Clinic's electronic health records.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Embedding genomic data into the patient's chart in a way that is easy to locate and access — right there, when and where it is needed —&amp;nbsp;will assist doctors in making important decisions and advance the future of genomically informed medicine" she says. "For patients waiting for answers, this access could potentially mean less time spent in uncertainty and quicker guidance on treatment and management options."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Klee notes that making these innovations part of routine care is a long-term goal.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We hope to make this the standard of care," Dr. Klee says. "We're building a future where precision medicine is no longer the exception but the expectation. We're giving providers and researchers the tools to make the right decisions, and quickly explore new ideas.”&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Manufacturing engineers are at the forefront of bringing new medicines derived from human sources such as cells, blood and genes to patients. They produce what are often first-of-their kind biotherapies for diseases that previously had few or no treatment options.</p>



<p>"The most interesting thing about our job is being able to be part of a team that brings transformative cell-based therapies to the clinic," says Kyle Ecker, advanced biomanufacturing engineer supervisor at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "It's incredibly fulfilling to understand the scientific basis of these therapies and watch them come to life by manufacturing products for individual patients."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> has 40 manufacturing engineers in Rochester and Florida. Their work makes it possible for researchers to conduct studies that require cells to be engineered on a very short timeline. In some cases, they've been able to have cells taken from patients, manufactured and returned to them in a few weeks or less. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/car-t-cell-therapy-program/home/orc-20404317" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cell therapy</a> for B-cell cancers and a cell-based vaccine for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a> are two examples of experimental biotherapies manufactured at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/cleanroom1.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>"Our engineering teams are very dedicated to patients. They know the importance of their job, and that's to get these drugs manufactured successfully so they can be given to patients in clinical trials," says Snigdha Rai, senior director of advanced biomanufacturing in the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "Without the engineers there would be no biomanufacturing and no cell and gene therapies for patients."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Special </strong><strong>c</strong><strong>lean room procedures</strong></h2>



<p>Manufacturing engineers work within a highly controlled laboratory setting or "clean room.” Clean rooms are facilities that operate according to current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations to ensure therapies are consistently manufactured and meet strict quality standards. These controlled environments have powerful purification systems to filter out pollutants such as dust, airborne particles, bacteria, fungus and mold that could compromise drug safety.</p>



<p>Adherence to strict cleanliness guidelines dictates how engineers do their job. Before stepping into a clean room, they train extensively how to operate in a cGMP facility&amp;nbsp; without triggering contamination. They perform techniques to keep everything extremely clean or sterile, using high dexterity skills such as taking the cap off a vial and putting it back on with one hand, while the other hand fills it with a chemical compound.</p>



<p>They dress in coveralls or a &amp;nbsp;"bunny suit" with a hood, goggles, face shield, double gloves and boot covers to block any escape of hair or skin cells. Once they've entered the clean room, their movements are slow and intentional.</p>



<p>"Rapid movements or quick opening of doors could trigger the sensors that monitor for microscopic particles," says Ecker. "People and materials must flow in a specific path to prevent any type of contamination. For example, we move in one direction, entering the clean room through one door while exiting through a separate door."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A blueprint for biomanufacturing</strong></h2>



<p>Manufacturing engineers have the pivotal role of being the first to run processes that transform a cell and gene therapy from a discovery into experimental medicine for use in human clinical trials. They strictly follow standard operating procedures — a blueprint of sorts — to mass produce a new therapy. A minimum of two engineers work together at all times to ensure all cells are processed according to regulatory and quality standards.</p>



<p>"The team works very closely each step of the way. We check each other's work and keep detailed records confirming that all procedures have been completed," says Qing Cindy Shao, Ph.D., lead advanced biomanufacturing engineer. "There is no room for error."</p>



<p>An important function of the job is identifying when a procedure doesn’t work as intended. The therapy is then sent back to the investigator and process development group to troubleshoot the issue and make appropriate changes. On-site manufacturing facilities make it possible to address the errors early and resolve them quickly. That helps minimize delays for patients.</p>



<p>"Our manufacturing engineers are indispensable. They work with quality control, quality assurance and process development to ensure the therapy meets the requirements and are safe for patients," says Alina Oancea, manager of CGMP manufacturing. "When the processes work as intended, it takes about two weeks to manufacture a CAR-T cell product."</p>



<p>Engineers' shifts in a clean room could range from three to 10 hours depending on the project they are working on. When they've completed their process for the day, they turn off the equipment, clean up the space and dispose of biowaste. Their work plays a central role in Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics’ strategy of biomanufacturing new cell and gene biotherapies and collaborating with industry to make them available to patients around the world.</p>
