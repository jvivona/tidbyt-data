<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have pioneered an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, called OmicsFootPrint, that helps convert vast amounts of complex biological data into two-dimensional circular images.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Omics is the study of genes, proteins and other molecular data to help uncover how the body functions and how diseases develop. By mapping this data, the OmicsFootPrint may provide clinicians and researchers with a new way to visualize patterns in diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, that can help guide personalized therapies. It may also provide an intuitive way to explore disease mechanisms and interactions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of the tool are published in a new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39445795/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in&amp;nbsp;Nucleic Acids Research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Data becomes most powerful when you can see the story it's telling," says Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D., lead author of the study and associate professor of biomedical informatics at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</a> "The OmicsFootPrint could open doors to discoveries we haven't been able to achieve before."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Simplifying complex data</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genes act as the body’s instruction manual, while proteins carry out those instructions to keep cells functioning. Sometimes, changes in these instructions — called mutations — can disrupt this process and lead to disease. The OmicsFootPrint helps make sense of these complexities by turning data — such as gene activity, mutations and protein levels — into colorful, circular maps that offer a clearer picture of what’s happening in the body.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In their study, the researchers used the OmicsFootPrint to analyze drug response and cancer multi-omics data. The tool distinguished between two types of breast cancer — lobular and ductal carcinomas — with an average accuracy of 87%. When applied to lung cancer, it demonstrated over 95% accuracy in identifying two types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Small data sets bring big impacts</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study showed that combining several types of molecular data produces more accurate results than using just one type of data.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The OmicsFootPrint also shows potential in providing meaningful results even with limited datasets. It uses advanced AI methods that learn from existing data and apply that knowledge to new scenarios — a process known as transfer learning. In one example, it helped researchers achieve over 95% accuracy in identifying lung cancer subtypes using less than 20% of the typical data volume.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This approach could be beneficial for research even with small sample size or clinical studies," Dr. Kalari says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To enhance its accuracy and insights, the OmicsFootPrint framework also uses an advanced method called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP highlights the most important markers, genes or proteins that influence the results to help researchers understand the factors driving disease patterns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From research to clinical practice</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Beyond research, the OmicsFootPrint is designed for clinical use. It compresses large biological datasets into compact images that require just 2% of the original storage space. This could make the images easy to integrate into electronic medical records to guide patient care in the future.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team plans to expand the OmicsFootPrint to study other diseases, including neurological diseases and other complex disorders. They are also working on updates to make the tool even more accurate and flexible, including the ability to find new disease markers and drug targets.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers and collaborators have described — for the first time — the prevalence of <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune diseases</a> in the U.S. Their research, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, reports that about 15 million people are estimated to have one or more of 105 autoimmune diseases. The study also found that autoimmune diseases occur most often in women and identified the top autoimmune diseases by prevalence, sex and age.</p>

<p>"Knowing the number of patients with an autoimmune disease in the U.S. is critical to assess whether these diseases are increasing or decreasing over time and with treatment," says the study's corresponding author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>, vice-chair of translational research for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Knowing this number is also critical for funding agencies to raise money and awareness for research into autoimmune diseases as a group and for individual autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Knowing which diseases occur more often in males or females and at what age is critical in understanding the pathogenesis of disease and how they impact the healthcare system."&amp;nbsp; Dr. Fairweather also leads the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/translational-cardiovascular-disease-research/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Translational Cardiovascular Disease Research Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>To conduct the study, Dr. Fairweather and co-senior author Aaron Abend from the <a href="https://www.autoimmuneregistry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Autoimmune Registry</a> used electronic health record data from over 10 million patients from six large medical systems in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Iowa, Wisconsin and Missouri who had been diagnosed with at least one of 105 autoimmune diseases considered in the study. They then extended the data to an estimated U.S. population of 333.3 million. The researchers developed a program algorithm to compute the first nationwide prevalence estimate of autoimmune diseases as a category. Dr. Fairweather says previous U.S. estimates were based on meta-analyses and extrapolations for individual autoimmune diseases, which can make estimations of prevalence inaccurate. She says many challenges have existed to obtain accurate prevalence data, including the lack of international consensus on a definition of autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>The findings indicated that about 15 million people, or 4.6% of the U. S. population, were diagnosed with at least one autoimmune disease between January 2011 and January 2022, and that 34% of those individuals were diagnosed with more than one autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>The study also found:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Females (63% of those with autoimmune disease) were almost twice as likely as males (37%) to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.</li>



<li>65% of patients had one autoimmune disease.</li>



<li>24% of patients had two autoimmune diseases.</li>



<li>8% of patients had three autoimmune diseases.</li>



<li>2% of patients had four or more autoimmune diseases.</li>
</ul>



<p>The top five diseases based on prevalence were rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, type I diabetes, Graves' disease and autoimmune thyroiditis.</p>



<p>"What dramatically stands out with this assessment is that the most prevalent autoimmune diseases occur in women and autoimmune diseases that occur more often in men occur rarely," says Dr. Fairweather. "This raises important questions that need to be answered with more research. For example, could this be the result of diagnosis bias, or is this a fundamental biological sex difference?"</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather served on a National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) committee on autoimmune diseases and testified before Congress in May 2022 to give recommendations for advancing research in autoimmune diseases. This led to the establishment of a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/in-the-spotlight/all-articles/orwh-announces-formation-of-new-office-of-autoimmune-disease-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Autoimmune Disease Research</a> within the Office of Research on Women's Health. In December 2023, the NIH sought input from members of the scientific community, federal partners, academic institutions, the private sector, health professionals, professional societies, advocacy groups, patient communities and other interested people for the development of an NIH-wide strategic plan to advance autoimmune disease research.</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather says her team has provided the program algorithm freely to the research community, allowing anyone to leverage this research tool to replicate the study using almost any healthcare database. In addition, researchers can use the tool over time to track shifts in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases, offering valuable insights for future research.</p>



<p>This research was partially funded by a National Institutes of Health grant under award R01 HL164520. For a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding, see the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — The&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.minnesotapartnership.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota Partnership for Biotechnology and Medical Genomics (MNP)</a>&amp;nbsp;has announced its four research awardees for 2024. MNP is funded by the State of Minnesota and provides support for innovative research conducted by teams from the University of Minnesota (UMN) and Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Totaling $3 million, this year's awards support innovative projects on cognitive aging, cardiovascular disease, cancer and pulmonary hypertension.</p>



<p>They are:</p>



<p><strong>An essential role for complement signaling in microglia on diet-induced hypothalamic neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and aging-associated cognitive impairment.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/alessandro-bartolomucci" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alessandro Bartolomucci, Ph.D.</a> (UMN), <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/baker-darren-j-ph-d-m-s/bio-00027985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darren J. Baker, Ph.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic)</p>



<p>Obesity increases a patient's risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms linking obesity to AD remain unclear. Research has shown that obesity drives inflammation in the brain by activating a type of neuro-specific immune cell called microglia. Complement 3a receptor 1 (C3aR1) has been shown to mediate immune responses in many cell types, including microglia, in many disease states, including obesity. This project aims to determine whether blocking C3aR1 can reduce obesity-induced neuroinflammation and cognitive decline. If successful, the findings could identify a potential new drug target for AD.</p>



<p><strong>Macrophage networks and checkpoints in cardiovascular disease.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lutgens-esther-m-d-ph-d/bio-20561018" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Esther Lutgens, M.D., Ph.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic), <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/jop-van-berlo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jop van Berlo, M.D., Ph.D.</a> (UMN)</p>



<p>Inflammation is a key driver of cardiovascular disease (CVD), with macrophages being one of the primary cell types responsible for this inflammation. Immunotherapies that reduce macrophage activation may help lower the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients. There are various subtypes of macrophages, and this project aims to identify which subtypes contribute to the progression of atherosclerosis and heart failure. Specifically, the team will investigate whether immunotherapies targeting macrophage subtypes expressing immune checkpoints can inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and heart failure. If successful, the project could lead to the discovery of new drug targets for CVD.</p>



<p><strong>Identifying T cell subsets contributing to immune related adverse events caused by immunotherapy.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://med.umn.edu/bio/vaiva-vezys" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaiva Vezys, Ph.D.</a> (UMN), <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rogers-laura-m-ph-d/bio-20472660" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laura M. Rogers, Ph.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic)</p>



<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are groundbreaking cancer treatments and are now widely used as the first option for many types of cancer. However, there's no way to predict which patients will respond well to ICIs, and serious side effects — called immune-related adverse events (irAEs) — occur in about 55% of patients. These side effects happen because ICIs activate T cells, a type of immune cell, which can mistakenly attack healthy parts of the body while targeting cancer. This project will use a new mouse model, developed by the team, to study how specific subtypes of T cells contribute to the side effects caused by ICIs. If successful, the research could lead to new tools to predict and reduce side effects, improving cancer treatments for many patients.</p>



<p><strong>Understanding Endothelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EndMT) in Vascular Remodeling of Pulmonary Hypertension.</strong></p>



<p>Co-Principal Investigators: <a href="https://hi.umn.edu/research/faculty/aleksandra-babicheva-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aleksandra Babicheva, Ph.D.</a> (UMN), <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pabelick-christina-m-m-d/bio-00027256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christina Pabelick, M.D.</a> (Mayo Clinic)</p>



<p>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a serious, progressive disease defined by high arterial pressure in the lungs and has limited treatment options aside from a lung transplant. One type of PH, called Group 3 PH, is linked to low oxygen levels (hypoxia) and affects the largest number of patients. Unfortunately, these patients tend to have the poorest survival rates, and there are currently no effective medications to treat it. In PH, the blood vessels in the lungs become narrowed and damaged over time, making it harder for blood to flow, which is known as vascular remodeling. One process involved in vascular remodeling is called endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndMT), where endothelial cells take on characteristics of mesenchymal cells (smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts), which are more pro-fibrotic. This study aims to mechanistically evaluate how hypoxia and specific vascular remodeling processes play a role in Group 3 PH. If successful, this research could help identify a new treatment to prevent or slow down the damage to lung blood vessels in PH patients</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers spent 2024 mining patient data, leveraging artificial intelligence and conducting clinical trials to reveal insights that improve patient care.</h3>



<p><em>By Mayo Clinic staff</em></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center physicians and scientists are researching the causes of cancer and its recurrence, innovating new methods to detect cancer as early as possible, and developing new and more effective treatments. Here are some of their top success stories from the past year:</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/25/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New study finds triple-negative breast cancer tumors with an increase in immune cells have lower risk of recurrence after surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>A multicenter, international study suggests that people who have early-stage&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/01/03/understanding-triple-negative-breast-cancer-and-its-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC) and high levels of immune cells within their tumors may have a lower risk of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044575#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20cancer%20recurrence,cells%20from%20your%20cancer%20remained." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a>&amp;nbsp;and better survival rates — even without chemotherapy treatment. The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2816923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;was published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA).</p>



<p>The immune cells, also known as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), are immune system cells that can move from the bloodstream into a&amp;nbsp;tumor and&amp;nbsp;can recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"This is an important finding because it highlights that the abundance of TILs in breast tissue is a prognostic biomarker in people with early-stage triple-negative breast cancer, even when chemotherapy is not administered," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, a breast medical oncologist at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;nbsp;</a>and first author of the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/04/30/mayo-researchers-invented-a-new-class-of-ai-to-improve-cancer-research-and-treatments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo researchers invented a new class of AI to improve cancer research and treatments</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers recently invented a new class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms called hypothesis-driven AI, which is a significant departure from traditional AI models that learn solely from data. In a review published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38398213/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancers</a>, the researchers note that this emerging class of AI offers an innovative way to use massive datasets to help discover the complex causes of diseases such as cancer and improve treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"This fosters a new era in designing targeted and informed AI algorithms to solve scientific questions, better understand diseases, and guide individualized medicine," says senior author and co-inventor&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/li-hu-ph-d/bio-20035057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hu Li, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic Systems biology and AI researcher in the Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. "It has the potential to uncover insights missed by conventional AI."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/06/11/melanoma-in-darker-skin-tones-race-and-sex-play-a-role-mayo-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Melanoma in darker skin tones: Race and sex play a role, Mayo study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>Melanoma is often detected later in people with darker skin complexions, and the consequences can be devastating, a Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;reveals. While&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884">melanoma</a>&amp;nbsp;may be found less frequently in people with darker complexions than fair ones, this serious form of cancer can affect anyone. The study consisted of 492,597 patients with melanoma. Findings suggests that added vigilance in early screening is particularly needed for Black men, whose cancers are often found at later stages, leading to worse outcomes compared to white patients.</p>



<p>"We compared non-Hispanic Black patients to white patients and saw striking differences in how patients presented with the disease," says surgical oncologist&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study and a researcher at&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "We saw more extremity melanoma and more later-stage disease."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/07/04/new-research-platform-assesses-brain-cancer-mutations-during-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research platform assesses brain cancer mutations during surgery</strong></a></p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2318843121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Mayo Clinic researchers report on a new surgical platform used during brain cancer surgery that informs critical decision-making about tumor treatment within minutes. The platform uses mass spectrometry, a sensitive technique used to analyze substances in tissue samples, to identify a key gene mutation in&amp;nbsp;brain cancer in real time.</p>



<p>The researchers say that, in addition to enabling real-time diagnosis, the platform allows surgeons to determine a patient's prognosis and perform tumor resection to improve patient outcomes. In the future, the new platform will help surgeons tailor treatment to the molecular features of a tumor.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/14/mayo-clinic-study-uncovers-genetic-cancer-risks-in-550-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Mayo Clinic study uncovers genetic cancer risks in 550 patients</strong></a></p>



<p>Current screening protocols fail to catch a notable number of people carrying genetic mutations associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome and Lynch syndrome, which increase the risk of developing certain cancers. This issue is particularly pronounced among underrepresented minorities.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/10.1200/PO.24.00106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research findings</a>, published in JCO Precision Oncology, are based on genetic screenings of more than 44,000 study participants from diverse backgrounds.</p>



<p>Researchers sequenced the exomes, the protein-coding regions of genes where most disease-causing mutations are found. They identified 550 people (1.24% of participants) as carriers of the hereditary mutations.&amp;nbsp;Importantly, half of these people were previously unaware of their hereditary genetic risk, and 40% did not meet existing clinical guidelines for genetic testing.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/20/new-research-discovers-a-new-combination-of-therapy-for-people-with-a-type-of-leukemia-leading-them-to-live-longer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>New research discovers a new combination of therapy for people with a type of leukemia, leading them to live longer</strong></a></p>



<p>In a new multicenter, international study led by Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, researchers found that people with the B-cell precursor subtype of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/acute-lymphocytic-leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acute lymphoblastic leukemia</a> (BCP-ALL), who also lacked a genetic abnormality known as the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-myelogenous-leukemia/multimedia/how-the-philadelphia-chromosome-forms/img-20007421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philadelphia chromosome</a>&amp;nbsp;and were in remission with no trace of cancer, showed significantly higher survival rates when blinatumomab was added to their chemotherapy treatment. The randomized study results are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>



<p>"These results are encouraging and establish a new standard of treatment for people with BCP-ALL," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/litzow-mark-r-m-d/bio-20053695" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Litzow, M.D.</a>, lead study author and a Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center hematologist. "The addition of blinatumomab to chemotherapy reduced the risk of leukemia recurrence and death by nearly 60%."</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/08/27/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Detecting pancreatic cancer through changes in body composition and metabolism</strong></a></p>



<p>Pancreatic cancer is often diagnosed too late for effective treatment. However, research findings from Mayo Clinic represent a promising step toward identifying biological signals or biomarkers that could help in early detection.</p>



<p>Researchers examined medical records of patients with a common type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">pancre</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421">tic cancer</a> known as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They analyzed abdominal CT scans and blood tests taken up to three years before the patients were diagnosed. Using advanced algorithms, the researchers measured changes in body fat, muscle and bone, as well as shifts in blood-based biomarkers like cholesterol and glucose levels.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the journal&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38703880/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>, revealed changes in various physiological and metabolic measurements. The team's early findings suggest that capturing the subtle yet significant body changes that occur as pancreatic cancer develops could be a key strategy in early detection.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/11/05/radiopharmaceutical-therapy-shows-favorable-results-for-people-with-tough-to-treat-meningioma-brain-tumors-mayo-clinic-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Radiopharmaceutical therapy shows favorable results for people with tough-to-treat meningioma brain tumors, Mayo Clinic study finds</strong></a></p>



<p>A radiopharmaceutical therapy that has successfully extended progression-free survival for patients with neuroendocrine tumors shows early signs of delivering similar benefits to patients with difficult-to-treat&amp;nbsp;meningioma, a type of brain tumor. The nonrandomized phase 2 study's findings were presented at the&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've found a therapy with a meaningful signal for effectiveness and safety for people with refractory meningioma, a condition with no standard treatment options," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/merrell-kenneth-w-m-d/bio-20434012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Merrell, M.D.</a>, lead researcher of the trial and a radiation oncologist at&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/breakthrough-in-treatment-approach-showing-promise-in-the-fight-against-glioblastoma-the-deadliest-and-most-aggressive-type-of-brain-cancer/"><strong>Breakthrough in treatment approach showing promise in the fight against glioblastoma, the deadliest and most aggressive type of brain cancer</strong></a></p>



<p>Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may improve overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed&amp;nbsp;glioblastoma&amp;nbsp;while maintaining their quality of life. The phase 2, single-arm study results are published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiation oncologist, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months, and the median overall survival was 13.1 months. "As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-treatment-could-delay-cancer-progression-in-patients-with-high-risk-smoldering-multiple-myeloma/"><strong>Research shows new treatment could delay cancer progression in patients with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma</strong></a></p>



<p>A new treatment is showing promise for people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). This precancerous condition can progress to active&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer. High-risk SMM carries a higher likelihood of progression.</p>



<p>Results from a phase 3 clinical trial, published in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a>&amp;nbsp;and presented at the <a href="https://www.hematology.org/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Hematology meeting</a>, demonstrated that daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells, significantly reduces the risk of progression to active multiple myeloma and improves overall survival compared to active monitoring.</p>



<p>"These results are a major advancement in the treatment of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. Vincent Rajkumar, M.D.</a>, hematologist,&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center&amp;nbsp;and lead investigator of the trial. "For the first time, we have a treatment option that can significantly delay or prevent the progression to active disease, improving patients' lives and offering them a chance at a longer, healthier future."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>



<p>"We think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disease research. We hope to save time and resources and avoid the development of therapies that fail upon translation into patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, who leads the Translational Neuroimmunology Lab.&amp;nbsp;"Understanding which treatments show potential for success in human organoids could dramatically accelerate the rate of new therapies for patients with unmet needs."</p>

<p>Early detection improves treatment outcomes for endometrial and ovarian cancers, yet far too often, women are diagnosed when in advanced stages of these diseases. Unlike many other cancers, there are no standard screenings for early detection of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Mayo Clinic researchers have uncovered specific microbial signatures linked to endometrial and ovarian cancers, and they are working toward developing innovative home swab tests for women to assess their susceptibility.<br><br>"This research not only brings us closer to understanding the microbial dynamics in cancer, but also holds the potential to transform early detection and treatment strategies to positively impact women's health globally," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>, an assistant professor of surgery leading this research.</p>

<p>People who experience chronic exposure to racism may be affected by factors such as intergenerational trauma, reduced access to healthcare, differential treatment in healthcare settings and psychological distress. These negatively affect heart health and can have a cumulative effect throughout a person's life. Researchers from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota published a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/c2dream-framework-investigating-the-structural-mechanisms-undergirding-racial-health-inequities/76ADDAD3F3EEFCBA9E56123E56CB026A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&amp;nbsp;which provides a new framework describing how racism affects heart health among people of color in Minnesota. The researchers are focused on reversing these disparities.<br><br>"This framework will help scientists explore and measure how chronic exposure to racism, not race, influences health outcomes," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/phelan-sean-ph-d/bio-20035285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Phelan, Ph.D.,</a>&amp;nbsp;a Mayo Clinic health services researcher.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sung-jaeyun-ph-d/bio-20320110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeyun Sung, Ph.D.</a>, developed an innovative computational tool that analyzes the gut microbiome, a complex ecosystem of trillions of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microorganisms within the digestive system, to provide insights into overall well-being. In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51651-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Nature Communications, the tool demonstrated at least 80% accuracy in differentiating healthy people from those with any disease. The tool, called Gut Microbiome Wellness Index 2, could detect even subtle changes in gut health, identifying whether a person may be progressing toward or recovering from a disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Finally, we have a standardized index to quantitatively measure how healthy a person's gut microbiome is," says Dr. Sung, the senior author and computational biologist at Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine's Microbiomics Program. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-researchers-develop-tool-that-measures-health-of-a-persons-gut-microbiome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more.</a>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a significant advancement for rare disease research, Mayo Clinic scientists developed a semi-automated system, known as RENEW, to rapidly reanalyze unresolved rare disease cases. Described in a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38538918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Human Genetics, RENEW (REanalysis of NEgative Whole-exome/genome data) provided probable diagnoses for 63 of 1,066 undiagnosed cases. This innovative technology, launched in 2022, continuously compares patient genomic data against the latest global research, uncovering previously elusive genetic variants linked to disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Considering that the majority of patients with rare diseases who undergo genomic sequencing remain without a diagnosis, this is no small accomplishment," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ferrer-alejandro-ph-d/bio-20503546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alejandro Ferrer, Ph.D.</a>, a translational omics researcher at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine and lead author of the study. "Each successful diagnosis facilitated by RENEW signifies a profound breakthrough in providing answers and hope to people navigating the complexities of rare diseases."&amp;nbsp; <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/pioneering-mayo-clinic-technology-accelerates-precision-diagnoses-for-rare-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A team led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mansfield-aaron-s-m-d/bio-20116851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Mansfield , Ph.D</a>., developed a blood test potentially capable of detecting mesothelioma with greater accuracy than current methods. The test identifies complex DNA patterns linked to the disease, enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients with this aggressive cancer. By improving detection rates, the study could significantly impact survival outcomes for mesothelioma, which is often diagnosed in its later stages. The <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666364324000626?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proof-of-concept study</a> was published in the Journal of Thoracic Oncology Clinical and Research Reports.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“We're pushing the frontiers of what's possible in blood-based monitoring," says Dr. Mansfield, a medical oncologist and lead author of the study at the Center for Individualized Medicine and the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "Improving detection rates could offer insights into monitoring patients' responses to therapy and detecting recurrence after surgery." <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/innovative-mayo-clinic-test-improves-mesothelioma-detection-rate-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic scientists have developed an immunotherapy strategy that potentially lays the groundwork for treating a spectrum of autoimmune diseases. The new technique, detailed in a preclinical study published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Biomedical Engineering</a>, involves combining chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) with mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), resulting in engineered stem cells known as CAR-MSCs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“The pioneering approach shows potential in targeting inflammatory disease sites more precisely and improving immunosuppression and healing outcomes,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a principal investigator and hematologist at Mayo Clinic. “We’re planning to study interventions that minimize the need for long-term medications for autoimmune diseases.” <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-scientists-pioneer-immunotherapy-technique-for-autoimmune-diseases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sung-jaeyun-ph-d/bio-20320110" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeyun Sung, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/warrington-kenneth-j-m-d/bio-00027302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenneth Warrington, M.D.</a>, discovered protein patterns in the blood that could improve the diagnosis and monitoring of giant cell arteritis. This chronic autoimmune disease causes inflammation in blood vessels and can lead to vision loss or stroke if untreated. The <a href="https://ard.bmj.com/content/early/2024/08/16/ard-2024-225868.info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, published in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases, analyzed over 7,000 proteins using proteomics.

This work lays the foundation for more precise diagnosis and personalized treatment options.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This precision enables us to refine treatment decisions," says Dr. Warrington, a rheumatologist and Director of the Vasculitis Clinic in the Division of Rheumatology in the Department of Internal Medicine. "Recognizing when a patient's disease is in remission allows us to reduce reliance on certain medications, which can minimize side effects and improve overall patient care."&amp;nbsp; <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/innovative-blood-analysis-technique-reveals-insights-into-giant-cell-arteritis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Read more.</a>&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The central dogma of molecular biology<a> —</a> cited in countless science textbooks — states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins. This basic idea is key to understanding how genes are expressed and how to overcome genetic defects that cause disease.</p>



<p>For much of history, researchers have treated diseases by targeting the proteins involved, such as giving insulin for diabetes or statins for heart disease. Over the last couple of decades, however, they have pursued gene therapies that target disease at the level of the DNA, including developing drugs that correct the genetic defect in sickle-cell disease. More recently, researchers have been advancing treatments that go after the often-overlooked molecule RNA. To do so, many are harnessing a technology known as antisense oligonucleotides.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="514" height="735" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-398043" style="width:708px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1.jpg 514w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>RNA molecules act as intermediaries between DNA and protein, but they also do so much more, says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cousin-margot-a-ph-d/bio-20503541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Margot Cousin, Ph.D.</a>, a translational genomics scientist at Mayo Clinic. There are RNAs that can perform biochemical reactions, and others that can regulate gene expression.</p>



<p>"We're trying to use some of the processes that exist in our body to design these drugs and make them work for us," says Cousin.</p>



<p>Antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, are short, synthetic strands of nucleotides designed to bind to complementary RNA sequences like the teeth in a zipper. These ASOs can look and behave differently depending on the type of genetic defect they are designed to target. An estimated 15 to 30 percent of genetic diseases are caused by mutations that disrupt RNA splicing, the process by which stretches of noncoding RNA are removed and the remaining coding regions are spliced back together.</p>



<p>"It's essentially like putting all the beads that you need to make your protein together and getting rid of all the string in between that you don't need," says Dr. Cousin.</p>



<p>Splicing mutations can cause these beads to be put together incorrectly, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; producing defunct proteins. Dr. Cousin says that researchers can create ASOs to block these mutations and set splicing back on track. For example, the first FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an ASO that modifies the splicing of the SMN2 gene to ramp up the production of functional SMN protein, which is lacking in SMA patients.</p>



<p>Alternatively, mutations can cause a gene to be expressed abnormally or to acquire new properties. In those cases, scientists can design ASOs to specifically bind to the RNA sequences generated by the faulty genes and flag them to be degraded, effectively reducing the production of harmful proteins.</p>

<p>Dr. Cousin and her colleagues are currently assessing this technology for what is known as <em>n</em>=1 cases — those patients with ultra-rare diseases who have no other treatment options.</p>



<p>"These are patients with severe or life-threatening conditions where we know the risk of not treating is greater than the risk of treating with an experimental ASO," she says. "The chemistry of ASOs have already been approved for medicinal use, and their modular nature means that the researchers can simply change the order of the nucleotides to reach a specific target for patients who may benefit from this strategy."</p>



<p>"Our understanding of the human genome and genetic causes of disease continues to grow and therapeutic tools like ASOs are increasingly being pursued to overcome them," said Dr. Cousin. "The study and development of genetic therapies including ASOs will bring precision medicine to those in need with increasing frequency, making them a remarkable drug tool to explore right now."</p>

<p>When Roseanne Nooren began her Ph.D. training four years ago, she found great purpose in studying pancreatic cancer. "Once a person is diagnosed, it may be only months before they pass, and that's largely because of the way the cancer metastasizes," she says. "I thought this was an area of research that could really make a difference." In her thesis research with co-mentors <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/razidlo-gina-ph-d/bio-00096936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Razidlo, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mcniven-mark-a-ph-d/bio-00026682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark McNiven, Ph.D.</a>, at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, she already has made strides in understanding how pancreatic tumors spread. She's also identifying ways to halt the process.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/RoseanneNooren.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397745" style="width:199px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/RoseanneNooren.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/RoseanneNooren-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roseanne Nooren</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nooren's graduate training included classes about cancer, but Dr. Razidlo suggested Nooren look into an additional opportunity: a course specifically about pancreatic cancer where she could meet others in the field. Nooren applied and was accepted to attend a week-long intensive pancreatic cancer course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York — a prestigious program that brings together about 30 nationally and internationally known researchers. "I was excited about the idea of the course — and also nervous," she says. "It was an opportunity to meet many scientists whose journal articles I had been reading."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But first, she had to figure out how to attain funding to attend the course. The answer was a special — and until now, anonymous — award earmarked for Mayo’s Ph.D. students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 1999, graduate students who are eligible to take a specialized course outside Mayo have been able to apply to the graduate school for a competitive travel grant to pay their tuition and expenses. The award was financed by an anonymous benefactor, and nearly 100 students over the years have taken advantage of the opportunity.&amp;nbsp; Students have gone to courses at sites like Woods Hole, Massachusetts, or Jackson Laboratories in Maine, to learn new microscopy techniques or new approaches in genetics. After they return, students send a thank you note for the funding. The donor has been happy to receive a summary from students about what they learned, but otherwise has remained in the shadows.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, the source of the funding came to light: two Mayo educators who initiated the grant decades ago. At her family's request, the newly named Lily Weinshilboum Travel Award for Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, honors the memory of the trained anatomist and biomedical researcher who taught at Mayo Clinic for 25 years. Lily Weinshilboum died in 2023 at the age of 86, but the grant she first imagined is continuing to contribute to the success of Mayo's Ph.D. students.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The importance of daring and determination</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the naming of the grant, Lily Weinshilboum's family hopes students will learn about her dedication to biomedical education and her enterprising spirit, says her husband and co-benefactor, Mayo Clinic internist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/weinshilboum-richard-m-d/bio-00025916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Weinshilboum, M.D.</a>, the Mary Lou and John H. Dasburg Professor of Cancer Genomics Research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>As a young woman, Lily Weinshilboum traveled independently to the United States from Taiwan in 1954, determined to advance her interest in science. A scholarship enabled her to attend Ottawa University in Kansas. She went on to train as a neuroanatomist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and was a teaching assistant in graduate school when she met her husband, who was then a medical student. After completing her master's degree, she worked with a research group in Boston and later in a lab at the National Institutes of Health as Dr. Weinshilboum completed his training. The Weinshilboums came to Mayo Clinic in Rochester in 1972 for the next stage of their careers. Lily Weinshilboum's outgoing and nurturing personality made her a dynamic anatomy instructor in the medical school, where she connected with students as they embarked on their training and began to recognize the importance of their roles in patients' lives.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Daring and determination were themes in her life. Once she had retired, she came up with the idea for a fund to help graduate students take an extra step on their career paths. "She wanted to help graduate students gain perspective, learn new topics and begin to create networks with researchers by attending meetings that stretched beyond what was readily available at Mayo," says Dr. Weinshilboum, who serves as a Ph.D. mentor and dissertation advisor for graduate students. "We viewed the travel grants as one way we could help."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Former graduate students — now established researchers and educators — attest to the lifelong impact of those experiences. Regenerative science researcher and dermatologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wyles-saranya-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20476857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saranya Wyles, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, received travel funding in 2014 during her training in Mayo's <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/medical-scientist-training-program-md-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medical Scientist Training Program</a>. The money allowed her to attend a meeting in the United Kingdom focused on genetic engineering of stem cells. "Attending this event as a graduate student was a defining moment in my journey in regenerative medicine research," she says. "It reinforced my commitment to this field and paved the way for my current role as a research laboratory leader. Now I have the privilege of training Ph.D. and M.D.-Ph.D. students, and I encourage them to seek out similar opportunities and apply for the grant as well."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gaining confidence and building a network</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>For Nooren, the meeting earlier this year at Cold Spring Harbor already has been a game-changer. The week of lectures gave her ideas that she brought back to her research in Dr. Razidlo's lab, including a new approach in microscopy that will expand her work. She gained confidence as she gave a presentation of her own research findings and joined scientific conversations with seasoned scientists. "It made me braver, just feeling that my questions were valid and that I could bring my expertise," she says. "Even in graduate seminars now, I'm more confident, and when we discuss works in progress, I'm more likely to raise my hand and say, 'Hey, have you tried this?'"&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Nooren also met like-minded colleagues as she learned about other pancreatic cancer labs around the country and met potential future collaborators. She hopes other students will apply for the grant to attend a course that expands their own research interests. "It's such an opportunity to connect, even though you're a student and you're at the first stages of becoming a scientist," she says. "You're learning and interacting with everyone, and you're all putting your heads together to try to solve the problems in the field. It was an amazing experience."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That's exactly what Mrs. Weinshilboum intended in establishing the award, says Dr. Weinshilboum.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"She read students' summary notes with great interest and a great sense of pride in having been able to help make these experiences possible," he says. "She was focused on training the next generation and encouraging them to do bold things."</p>

<p>Richard Casper was one of the study participants. The Arizona man enrolled in the clinical trial at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix after his diagnosis of glioblastoma in 2019. Richard was given only months to live, but his family says thanks to his strength, perseverance, and innovative medical care, he survived nearly double the amount of time.</p>



<p>"To be almost two and a half, three years in after being told you only have a few months, it's quite remarkable," says Susan Casper, Richard's daughter.</p>



<p>Richard succumbed to the disease in 2023. During the treatment, his family says he had little to no side effects. In the months before his passing, Richard stated, "I feel great. If someone didn't tell me I have the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-learn-about-meningioma-and-glioblastoma-brain-tumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a>, I wouldn't even know it."</p>

<p>"The patients lived longer than we expected. This patient population is expected to live six to nine months. Our average survival was 13.1 months. There were some patients that were out closer to two years. The results exceeded our expectations. We are very pleased," says Dr. Vora.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is glioblastoma so deadly?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/glioblastoma-in-older-adults-improving-survival-and-quality-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glioblastoma</a> is among the most challenging cancers to treat. The disease is aggressive and invades healthy brain tissue with hairlike tentacles. "That is why doing a complete surgery is very difficult, as compared to say <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, where a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> can be performed to remove not only the tumor, but a healthy rim of tissue around it," explains Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Surgery for glioblastoma presents a different set of obstacles. "When it comes to glioblastoma, it is challenging to do that level of surgery. You try to surgically remove whatever you can safely without leaving the patient worse off after surgery."</p>



<p>Another factor that makes glioblastoma so lethal is that it can be fast- growing and unresponsive to treatment. </p>



<p>"These cancer cells are quite challenging to overcome," says Dr. Vora. "There are some patients we see after their surgery, and by the time we are ready to start their treatment, they've already had a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/connect-with-other-patients-who-have-fear-of-cancer-recurrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a> of the disease."</p>

<p>An estimated 14,500 people will be diagnosed with glioblastoma in the U.S this year. "In the best of circumstances the average survival rates are in the 14-15 month range. But for patients 65 and older, the group that was the focus of our study, patients do even worse. The prognosis for this population is between six and nine months," says Dr. Vora.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Attacking glioblastoma with a triad </strong></h2>



<p>For the clinical trial, Dr. Vora and his team mapped out a plan that would allow them to be more intentional and precise with treating the location of the glioblastoma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397931" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-300x163.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-768x417.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1536x834.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-2048x1112.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"It is the triad of metabolic imaging, proton beam therapy and hypofractionation, which is a shorter course of radiation that might be the best combination to treat glioblastoma in the 65-and-older patient population."</p><cite>Dr. Sujay Vora, radiation oncologist &amp;amp; Principal study investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The imaging incorporated the use of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. "<sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET is an amino acid tracer that can cross the blood brain barrier, and it can accumulate within the glioblastoma cells itself," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Researchers combined these images to determine the location of the most metabolically active "hot spots" of the cancer in the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking aim with proton beam therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Study investigators used one of the most advanced forms of radiation treatment, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>. </p>



<p>"With standard <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/living-with-cancer-what-is-radiation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a>, the beams go through the brain tissue, so there's an entrance dose and the exit dose. But with proton beam therapy, we dial up how deeply we want the radiation to go," explains Dr. Vora. "It drops off its energy in the tumor, and then there's basically no radiation after that. It allows us to be more preferential into the delivery of radiation and protect more of the healthy surrounding tissue."</p>

<p>During proton beam therapy, a patient lies on a table while the machine rotates around the patient's head targeting the tumor with an invisible beam. The patient is awake for the procedure. It is painless with many patients reporting fewer to no side effects.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional radiation for glioblastoma, which is typically delivered over the course of three to six weeks, treatment with proton beam therapy for the study was conducted in one to two weeks.</p>

<p>"I am hopeful that this is the first step of many where we can continue to move the needle and allow patients to live longer and live well," says Dr. Vora. "The goal is to improve the outcomes for our patients allowing them to spend more time with their families."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nadya's story</strong></h2>



<p>2022 was a tough year for Nadya El-Afandi. She was on the verge of celebrating a long but successful battle with breast cancer.</p>



<p>"Out of the blue, I had a seizure. I went to the hospital, they did an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-questions-about-mri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>.  After additional tests they told me the news: 'You have a glioblastoma,'" recalls Nadya. She asked her doctor if she should continue her breast cancer treatment. "He said, 'No'-meaning the glioblastoma would kill me before the breast cancer."</p>



<p>Nadya was not about to give up.</p>

<p>Nadya is a wife and mother of four children. She lives just outside of Rochester, Minnesota. "My children said to me, 'Mom, you're a unicorn. Of course you'll live.' My mother has had a number of medical conditions and we never expected her to live this long. And she's still alive and with us," says Nadya. "My children have also said, 'You've got grandma's blood in you. You will live.'"</p>



<p>Nadya is receiving care at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>. That's where she learned about a new clinical trial called SAGA, or stereotactic ablative radiation treatment for glioblastoma. The phase 2 clinical trial is building upon Dr. Vora's research and studying a larger group of patients. The study is being led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Dr. William</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Breen</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Our goal is to transform the way we treat glioblastoma - in that we are using advanced imaging to help us better target the tumor. We're looking at shorter courses of radiation to minimize the burden on patients and their families and hopefully complete effective and safe treatment in a shorter amount of time.</p><cite>William Breen, M.D., Radiation Oncologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It has been 15 months since Nadya began treatment for glioblastoma. So far, there is no sign the glioblastoma has returned. "Nadya has already exceeded the time that's expected time to have a tumor recurrence, and she continues to do well," says Dr. Breen. "Nadya is beyond some measures of what the average, overall survival time would be."</p>



<p>While Nadya's progress in encouraging, Dr. Breen says it is important to note that it is too early to draw any conclusions about safety or efficacy of this approach to treatment until the study is completed.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nadya is focused on living her life to the fullest. Fifteen months after undergoing treatment, Nadya embarked on an adventure to Hawaii, where she spent time taking helicopter tours, snorkeling and hiking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We are living on the edge of medical miracles, and we are riding that tide. There's no cure for glioblastoma yet. But I've been able to take advantage of this medical opportunity, and it has given me a quality of life that is just outstanding. Every day is the best day and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it."</p><cite>Nadya El-Afandi, glioblastoma patient</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>PHOENIX — You may be familiar with a range of tips for living a healthy life: Watch your weight, exercise, eat nutritious food and don’t smoke, for example. What if you could combine these lifestyle factors with a host of other variables to learn your risk of developing specific diseases, to help catch and treat them early or prevent them altogether? <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ortega-victor-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20520652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, associate director for the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a> in Arizona, explains how science is drawing ever closer to making such personal health forecasts possible.</p>



<p>Previously inconceivable, such personal guides to well-being are becoming increasingly possible because of new and sophisticated genome-wide technologies that capture data spanning entire genomes, Dr. Ortega says. The complex scores are compiled from a combination of data from thousands to hundreds of thousands of a person's DNA sequence variants. This type of large genome-wide data has the potential to predict disease risks, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma</a> and specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancers</a>.</p>



<p>"Imagine knowing your genetic predisposition for having a heart attack in your 50s, or if you're in the top 5% of the population for the risk of cancer or diabetes based on data from your whole genome. With this knowledge, you could make informed lifestyle choices and receive enhanced screenings to mitigate that risk," Dr. Ortega says. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As a pulmonologist and genomic scientist, Dr. Ortega is leading a charge to breathe new life into precision medicine advancements. His mission is rooted in a deep commitment to health equities and inspired by his grandmother.&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397911" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"My grandmother died of asthma, and that should not have happened. She was Puerto Rican like me, and Puerto Ricans have the highest severity and frequency of asthma of any ethnic group in the world," Dr. Ortega says. "They also represent less than 1% of people in genetic studies. So, I've made it a life mission to develop cures and diagnostics for people like my grandma, and for all people."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Each person has millions of genetic variants, each having a small effect. But together, these variants can increase the risk of getting a condition. A <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/emerge-genome-informed-risk-assessment/risk-assessment/polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polygenic risk score</a> estimates the overall risk someone has of getting a disease by adding up the small effects of variants throughout an individual’s entire genome.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Polygenic risk scores are not used to diagnose diseases. Some people who don't have a high-risk score for a certain disease still can be at risk of getting the disease or might already have it. Other people with high-risk scores may never get the disease.</p>



<p>People with the same genetic risk can have different outcomes depending on other factors such as lifestyle which determine one’s lifelong environmental exposures, also called the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tomorrows-cure-how-a-lifetime-of-exposures-impact-health-exposome-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposome</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Ortega says that getting to the point where all people know their polygenic risk scores will require a solid foundation of "omics" research and datasets, cutting-edge technologies and further discoveries of gene-disease links — all of which are within his team's expertise and capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/pillars-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omics</a> is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more.</p>



<p>"It's going to take considerable work and planning, but it really is the way of the future," he says.</p>



<p>In the shorter term, Dr. Ortega plans to transition more omics discoveries from research laboratories to the clinic. Omics data can help identify the molecular culprits driving a person's disease, as well as biomarkers that can lead to the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics.</p>



<p>Recent omics discoveries at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine have enabled scientists to predict <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-study-lays-foundation-to-predict-antidepressant-response-in-people-with-suicide-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antidepressant response</a> in people with depression and discover a potential <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-mayo-clinic-algorithm-shows-potential-in-individualizing-treatment-for-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">therapeutic strategy</a> for bone marrow cancer. Scientists have also used omics to pinpoint <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-pinpoint-genetic-variations-that-might-sway-course-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic variations</a> that potentially increase the risk for severe COVID-19, uncover <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-provides-critical-information-about-the-size-and-growth-speed-of-gliomas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential clues</a> for preventing and treating gliomas and unravel the genetic mystery of a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/scientists-unravel-genetic-mystery-of-rare-neurodevelopmental-disorder-provide-definitive-diagnoses-to-21-families-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare neurodevelopmental disorder</a>.</p>



<p>Drawing from his years of extensive clinical experience in treating patients with severe respiratory illnesses, Dr. Ortega is also working to expand genomic testing to a broader set of diseases. He highlights the center's collaborative Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases as an effective model that he hopes to amplify.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advancing-rare-disease-breakthroughs-with-genomics-ai-and-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases</a> proactively engages healthcare teams across Mayo's clinical practice to conduct&amp;nbsp;targeted genomic testing for patients with a suspected rare genetic disease. He says expanding this strategy to more diseases will help build collaborations across Mayo and educate more clinicians on genomics. It may also ensure the most effective genomic sequencing tests are given to patients, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.</p>



<p>Dr. Ortega is leading the development of a polygenic risk score framework for Mayo Clinic, beginning with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interstitial lung disease</a>.
