<p>It may sound like something out of a science fiction movie, but it is reality. Mayo Clinic researchers are developing personalized lung cancer vaccines.</p>



<p>"We actually make a vaccine that's specific for each individual's cancers," says Dr. Knutson.</p>

<p>The process involves analyzing cancer cells to create a one-of-a-kind vaccine.</p>



<p>"We can take a small part of that cancer and sequence that cancer and get the information that we need to design the vaccine," he explains.</p>



<p>The vaccine uses the immune system to identify and combat cancer.</p>



<p>"We can use that vaccine to hopefully prevent the disease from coming back, or we can use it to help shrink a tumor when given with other types of therapies," Dr. Knutson says.</p>



<p>You can reduce your risk of lung cancer by quitting smoking and avoiding exposure to secondhand smoke.</p>

<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a> affects nearly seven million Americans over the age of 65, or 1 in 9 people in this age group, according to the <a href="https://www.alz.org/media/Documents/alzheimers-facts-and-figures.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's Association</a>. Symptoms such as memory loss, trouble concentrating and performing familiar tasks, and personality changes start slowly and progress. Researchers have come a long way in understanding Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (AD/ADRD). A new <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/resource/28588/Highlights_Dementia_Research.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consensus study report</a>, "Preventing and Treating Dementia: Research Priorities to Accelerate Progress," identifies prevention and treatment strategies for the next decade. &nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Taner1-WF531935_0015.jpg" alt="portrait of Dr. Nilufer Taner" class="wp-image-362465" style="width:253px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Taner1-WF531935_0015.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/03/Taner1-WF531935_0015-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nilüfer Ertekin-Taner, M.D., Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We need cutting-edge treatments to help improve the lives of patients who are suffering from debilitating symptoms of dementia and prevention for those at risk," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ertekin-taner-nilufer-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nilüfer Ertekin-Taner, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, chair of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-neuroscience-florida/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Neuroscience</a> at Mayo Clinic and leader of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/genetics-of-alzheimers-disease-and-endophenotypes/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease and Endophenotypes Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic's campus in Florida. "Neurodegenerative diseases not only affect patients but also the friends and family who care for them."</p>



<p>Dr. Ertekin-Taner served on the select <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/research-priorities-for-preventing-and-treating-alzheimers-disease-and-related-dementias#sectionCommittee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ad hoc committee</a> of the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM)</a> which conducted a study assessing <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2024/12/report-identifies-research-priorities-for-alzheimers-disease-and-related-dementias-more-innovative-and-integrative-research-approaches-needed-to-speed-progress" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the state of research</a> on AD/ADRD and outlined critical research priorities for treatment and prevention, as well as potential barriers to progress. The National Institutes of Health, National Institute on Aging, and National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke asked NASEM to form the committee in response to a request from the U.S. Congress to accelerate research into these diseases.</p>



<p>Researchers looked broadly at the field, including basic to translational to clinical research; lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing and treating AD/ADRD; barriers to advancing progress in the field; and the most promising areas of research. The study looked at Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body dementia and other vascular causes of cognitive impairment and dementia.</p>



<p>The report identified 11 research priorities for further NIH-funded biomedical research, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Developing better tools, including novel biomarker tests and digital assessment technologies, to monitor brain health across the life course and to screen, predict and diagnose AD/ADRD at scale.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Implementing advances in clinical research methods and tools to generate data from real-world clinical practice settings that can inform future research.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Identifying factors driving AD/ADRD risk in diverse populations, particularly understudied and disproportionately affected groups, to better understand disease heterogeneity — including molecular subtypes and disparities in environmental exposures — and to identify prevention opportunities and advance health research equity.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Characterizing the exposome and gene-environment interactions across the life course to gain insights into biological mechanisms and identify opportunities to reduce AD/ADRD risk and increase resilience.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Integrating innovative approaches and novel tools into the planning, design and execution of studies to accelerate the identification of effective interventions.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Advancing the development and evaluation of combination therapies (including pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches) to better address the multifactorial nature of AD/ADRD.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Evaluating precision medicine approaches for the prevention and treatment of AD/ADRD to better identify interventions likely to benefit specific groups of individuals.</li>
</ul>



<p>The report calls for breaking down silos for more collaborative, multidisciplinary research; fostering inclusive research to eliminate health disparities; developing innovative funding strategies; and increasing innovation in research through the expansion of public-private partnerships, among others.</p>



<p>"The past decade of research investments in AD/ADRD has led to significant progress in our understanding of these diseases, bringing us closer to treatments," Dr. Taner said. "In the next decade, we must maintain the momentum of research and innovation to translate these advances to cures for millions of patients and caregivers affected by the dementia epidemic."</p>



<p><strong>Note: Dr. Ertekin-Taner will participate in a <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/event/44277_01-2025_research-priorities-for-preventing-and-treating-alzheimers-disease-and-related-dementias-report-release-webinar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">webinar</a> on Jan. 15 with other committee members to discuss the report.</strong></p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Against the backdrop of the 43<sup>rd</sup> Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announced the formation of Mayo Clinic Digital Pathology, designed on a platform architecture to boldly unlock the power of its extensive archive of digital slides to revolutionize pathology and accelerate medical breakthroughs.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's expertise, de-identified clinical data, and its Platform architecture, combined with technical expertise and resources of <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA</a>, a world leader in accelerated computing, is powering the ability to accelerate this transformation. In addition, to improve performance and scalability of generative AI in pathology, Mayo Clinic is collaborating with <a href="https://www.aignostics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aignostics</a>, an industry leader in building artificial intelligence (AI) models for digital solutions in precision medicine in a way that mirrors its established approach to patient care. This collaborative, multidisciplinary effort leverages both medical and technological strengths, and the early achievements are promising.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is reimagining what is possible in disease detection and prediction, both within its own system and globally. We are doing this by using large, diverse datasets to build powerful artificial intelligence models in pathology. This will make diagnoses faster, more accurate, and more efficient, improving treatment approaches and speeding new cures to patients," says Jim Rogers, CEO, Mayo Clinic Digital Pathology.</p>



<p>"AI-driven insights can accelerate diagnostics, enhance precision medicine and revolutionize patient care," said Kimberly Powell, VP of Healthcare and Life Sciences, NVIDIA. "By digitizing and harnessing the power of vast datasets through its Digital Pathology platform, powered by NVIDIA's accelerated computing, Mayo Clinic is helping pave the way for a future with faster medical breakthroughs, better treatments and improved outcomes for patients across the globe."</p>



<p>"Merging Mayo Clinic's data and expertise with our advanced machine learning capabilities will produce breakthrough foundation models and AI products that advance the field of precision medicine and meaningfully improve patient care," says Viktor Matayas, CEO of Aignostics.</p>



<p>The vast majority of pathology practices remain tethered to analog processes, hindering access to critical diagnostic data that could be used to expand diagnostics and treatments and speed the development of new therapies to benefit patients. To address this challenge, Mayo Clinic has moved quickly, investing in digitizing its pathology practice and by scanning its extensive archive of pathology slides, as well as prospectively scanning pathology slides from current patients. To date, Mayo Clinic Digital Pathology has leveraged 20 million digital slide images linked to 10 million patient records that incorporate treatments, medications, imaging, clinical notes, genomic data and more.</p>



<p>In less than two months, Mayo Clinic and Aignostics developed a leading foundation model built on 1.2 million deidentified slides from Mayo Clinic and Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, findings of which were published in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> on Jan. 9. Current efforts include developing and deploying new solutions enabled by this model. Future plans are focused on building new models, including one being trained on 5 million slides. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The NVIDIA collaboration will create a first-in-class infrastructure for building and deploying foundation models to accelerate generative AI advances in pathology and beyond. With NVIDIA's healthcare-specific full stack computing architecture for artificial intelligence, <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/clara/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NVIDIA Clara</a>, Mayo Clinic is building models that will open new frontiers in medicine and lay the foundation for more personalized patient experiences.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The development of Mayo Clinic Digital Pathology has been a planned process over many years. The pathology platform takes advantage of the portfolios of <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a>, a global network that drives digital innovation around diagnosis, treatment and operational improvements worldwide, and <a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a>, which provides advanced testing and pathology services for healthcare organizations worldwide. Continuing its efforts to transform healthcare, Mayo Clinic is working with investors and data providers to continue building a pathology platform that spurs innovation and transforms the medical practice for the benefit of healthcare systems and patients worldwide.</p>



<p>"These new capabilities using digital pathology data will unlock this critically important clinical information for building AI solutions for advanced diagnosis and care of patients and that will improve the lives of patients globally," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/callstrom-matthew-r-m-d-ph-d/bio-00085927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Callstrom, M.D. Ph.D.</a>, chair of Mayo Clinic Radiology in the Midwest and medical director for Generative AI and Strategy.</p>

<p>In 2020, the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) approved women's wrestling as an emerging sport. Since then, athletes, coaches and other leaders have recognized that its policies need to differ from those of men's wrestling.</p>



<p>Wrestling is a sport that divides competitors into weight classes or weight categories; how much athletes weigh at the time of competition is a vital component to determining the most equal opponent. Wrestlers at the high school and collegiate levels are required to complete a pre-season weight certification — consisting of a hydration test, a weigh-in and a body composition assessment — to determine the wrestler's minimal wrestling weight, which then dictates the lowest weight class they will be eligible to compete in.</p>



<p>When creating the initial weight policy for women's wrestling, the NCAA set the body fat percentage to determine an athlete's minimal wrestling weight at 12%. However, recent research led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/andrew-jagim-phd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Jagim, Ph.D.</a>, the director of Sports Medicine Research at Mayo Clinic, has determined that a 17% body fat percentage may be a more reasonable and safer alternative to use.</p>



<p>"There has been scrutiny and concern among sports medicine professionals that the 12% value may be too low." Dr. Jagim says. "It could predispose female wrestlers to disordered eating patterns, frequent weight cycling and risks of certain health conditions such as the Female Athlete Triad."</p>



<p>Dr. Jagim says the Female Athlete Triad is a condition that consists of a trio of health issues including menstrual dysfunction, hormonal imbalance and reductions in bone health.</p>



<p>Here, Dr. Jagim answers questions about his findings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What has your research shown about the current state of determining minimum weight for female wrestlers?</strong></h2>



<p>Values calculated during the preseason weight certification are established to discourage excessive weight cutting and frequent weight cycling throughout the season. Previously, a body fat percentage threshold of 12% was used for female wrestlers, which meant that a wrestler could reduce their weight to a point that would equate to a body fat percentage of 12%.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15502783.2024.2304561#d1e537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our work</a>, however, has identified that 95% of current female wrestlers have a body fat percentage above 17%, which indicates that not a lot of female wrestlers are engaging in excessive weight cutting to achieve the lower body fat percentage of 12%. Our work on this topic has helped provide evidence to the National Collegiate Athletics Association to encourage revision of their policies and adopt a new threshold of 17% for collegiate wrestlers. In the spring of 2025, I will be presenting our research to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nfhs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Federation of State High School Associations</a>&amp;nbsp;and recommending a threshold of 19% for high school wrestlers.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is it important to change how the minimum weight for these athletes is calculated?</strong></h2>



<p>It is important to continually evaluate sports policies to help promote a safe sporting environment for athletes. With the emergence and rapid growth of women's wrestling, we are learning more about the sport and subsequently have more information to make more informed decisions regarding safety policies. While it doesn't appear to be a major issue yet, as the sport continues to grow, we will likely see wrestlers face more pressure to gain a competitive advantage — and in wrestling, that often means trying to compete in the lowest allowable weight class. If the 12% body fat threshold were to remain in existence, we may see an increase in female wrestlers engaging in excessive weight-cutting practices that could significantly increase health risks and lead to various negative outcomes such as the Female Athlete Triad and an increased risk of injury and illnesses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What can athletes, coaches and parents do better to protect the athletes' health?</strong></h2>



<p>Some of the most important and effective things that can be done to protect the athletes' health is to follow evidence-based guidelines regarding optimal performance strategies. In brief, this means:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Getting at least eight hours of sleep per night as frequently as possible.</li>



<li>Following sports-specific fueling strategies (i.e., eating enough overall calories to support the high level of training and eating enough of the right macro and micronutrients to support the growth, development and recovery needs of a highly active young athlete).</li>



<li>Properly managing the training loads of an athlete, meaning trying to avoid excessive amounts of high-intensity training year-round and making sure to incorporate planned periods of rest or active recovery.</li>
</ul>



<p>From a wrestling-specific perspective, it's important to find the optimal weight and body fat percentage that allows the wrestler to feel their best, reduces the pressure of having to frequently cut weight throughout the season, and allows them to eat a healthy diet that provides the essential nutrients that their bodies require.</p>

</div></div>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Each year, many women undergo surgery for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pelvic-organ-prolapse/symptoms-causes/syc-20360557">pelvic organ prolapse</a>, a condition where weakened muscles and tissues allow organs like the bladder or uterus to shift and press against the vaginal wall. This typically results in feelings of tissue bulging from the vagina, pelvic pressure or urinary issues.</p>



<p>While the surgical procedure often alleviates symptoms, many women experience a common post-surgical complication: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447">urinary tract infections</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, researchers at Mayo Clinic, led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/occhino-john-a-m-d-m-s/bio-20055145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Occhino, M.D.</a>, have found a way to potentially predict who will develop these infections before surgery even begins. </p>



<p>Their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s41598-024-78809-1?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=oa_20241122&amp;amp;utm_content=10.1038%2Fs41598-024-78809-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> reveals that specific patterns in the vaginal microbiome — a community of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and viruses — could serve as early indicators of urinary tract infection risk.&nbsp;Their findings are published in Nature Scientific Reports.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Zeroing in on key bacteria</strong></h2>



<p>Their findings show that women with lower levels of the protective bacterial species <em>Lactobacillus</em> were more likely to develop urinary tract infections following pelvic organ prolapse surgery. In addition, they found that higher levels of <em>Prevotella</em> and <em>Gardnerella</em> — bacteria linked to inflammation and infection — are also associated with an increased risk of postoperative complications.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>The research also provides insights on how surgery itself impacts the microbiome. Samples taken after surgery showed notable disruptions to both the vaginal and urinary microbiomes. These changes included lower microbial diversity, which can leave the body more vulnerable to infection.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The reasons for the changes are likely multifactorial and may include preoperative antibiotic administration, vaginal cleansing prior to surgery and surgery itself.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our ability to detect these microbiome patterns provides a potential opportunity to personalize treatment strategies and improve outcomes," says Dr. Walther-Antonio, a microbiome researcher at Microbiomics Program at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>. Dr. Walther-Antonio also conducts research in the Departments of Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynecology, as well as the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Walther-Antonio's collaboration with Dr. Occhino bridges a gap between cutting-edge research and clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Understanding the microbiome's role in post-surgical infections gives us a unique opportunity to possibly prevent these complications altogether," says Dr. Occhino, a Mayo Clinic urogynecologic surgeon. Dr. Occhino specializes in treating pelvic floor disorders, including conditions like pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning microbiome data into action</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study analyzed microbiome samples from postmenopausal women undergoing a vaginal hysterectomy with pelvic reconstruction. Researchers collected samples using vaginal swabs or urine collection at five stages, including before surgery, immediately after and during recovery. Advanced sequencing techniques were used to map the genetic material of the microbes and identify changes in the microbial communities.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Walther-Antonio and Dr. Occhino plan to expand their research to include larger and more diverse patient groups. This effort aims to confirm their findings and explore interventions. This could include using probiotics to restore microbial balance before surgery or adjusting surgical timing for at-risk patients.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Dr. Walther-Antonio's other recent microbiome discoveries</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Walther-Antonio's expertise in microbiome research extends beyond surgical outcomes. Her work also focuses on specific microbial communities associated with gynecologic cancers, including<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-uterine-microbe-found-to-have-disease-causing-behavior-in-endometrial-cancer/"> endometrial </a>and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-link-ovarian-cancer-to-bacteria-colonization-in-microbiome/">ovarian cancers</a>. She has also investigated how these microbes may contribute to disease progression and influence treatment responses. These discoveries have driven the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/5-23-mayo-scientists-explore-swabs-for-early-endometrial-ovarian-cancer-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development of noninvasive swab tests</a> designed for earlier detection to improve outcomes.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Findings will help identify patients with breast, ovarian, pancreatic or prostate cancer who may benefit from targeted therapies </em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Findings from a multi-institutional, international study led by researchers from the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> have significantly advanced the understanding of genetic alterations in the BRCA2 gene, a key player in hereditary cancer risk. The researchers completed a comprehensive functional assessment of all possible variants within the crucial DNA-binding domain of BRCA2, resulting in the clinical classification of 91% of variants of uncertain significance (VUS) in this part of the gene. This finding dramatically improves the accuracy of genetic testing and will allow healthcare professionals to offer more precise risk assessments and personalized treatment plans for people carrying these variants.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>, utilized CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology to analyze the functional impact of almost 7,000 BRCA2 variants, definitively identifying those that increase cancer risk and those that do not. This new information will eliminate much of the uncertainty surrounding VUS, allowing for more informed decisions regarding cancer screening, preventive measures and treatment strategies.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906-240x300.jpg" alt="Dr. Fergus Couch" class="wp-image-398743" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Couch-Fergus-J._12923222_20220906.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This research is a major advancement in understanding the role of many BRCA2 variants in cancer predisposition," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professor of Medical Research at Mayo Clinic. "Until now, patients who carried VUS often worried if they would develop cancer, but now with the classification of these variants, we can provide a clearer picture of cancer risk and tailor both prevention strategies as well as breast cancer treatment accordingly."</p>



<p>The findings have immediate implications for genetic testing laboratories and healthcare professionals, aiding them in offering more precise and personalized care to patients with VUS. Many people with VUS may be notified about the reclassification of their VUS as the ClinVar BRCA1/2 expert panel and testing laboratories use the new information in testing reports and updates.&nbsp; In addition, this new insight will aid in identifying patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/brca-gene-test/about/pac-20384815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast, ovarian</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355427#:~:text=The%20connection%20between%20breast%20cancer%20and%20pancreatic%20cancer,to%20see%20if%20there%20is%20a%20mutation%20present." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> who might benefit from targeted therapies such as PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;"We now have a catalog of every possible VUS in this part of BRCA2 that can be used to guide clinical care," says Dr. Couch.</p>



<p>The researchers say that this research lays the groundwork for future studies characterizing and classifying all BRCA2 variants across diverse populations and cancer types, improving risk assessment for everyone.</p>



<p>The study involved collaborators at Ambry Genetics Inc., Duke University, H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania and several contributing studies from the CARRIERS consortium. The study was supported by funding from the National Cancer Institute, Mayo Clinic Breast Cancer SPORE (P50 CA116201) and R35 Outstanding Investigator Programs, the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, and the Breast Cancer Research Foundation.</p>

<p>Most patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a> and Alzheimer's Disease Related Dementias (ADRD) experience the gradual onset and progression of cognitive symptoms, leading to decline over years or decades. However, in a small subset of patients, symptoms begin rapidly, leading to dementia within one year and complete incapacitation within two years of symptom onset. A new study at Mayo Clinic aims to determine why patients with Alzheimer’s disease and ADRD develop this rapidly progressive dementia (RPD).</p>

<p>"The factors that give rise to extreme, rapidly progressive clinical traits are unknown," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a neurologist and clinical researcher at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "These cases are challenging to treat in practice because there are many possible causes and diseases to consider, many tests that can be done and a clear need to coordinate evaluations rapidly."</p>



<p>Dr. Day will lead a team of researchers from Mayo Clinic in Florida and Rochester, Minnesota, to study the biology of RPD through a project funded by the National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health (NIA/NIH).</p>



<p>Specifically, the research team and collaborators aim to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Determine the factors that make patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD susceptible to RPD.</li>



<li>Study the contributions of amyloid and tau toxic proteins and vascular changes in the brain to rates of progression in patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD.</li>



<li>Identify cellular pathways that contribute to rapid declines in patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD.</li>
</ul>



<p>The researchers plan to collect clinical and genomic information from 120 diverse patients with rapid progressive Alzheimer's disease and ADRD over the next three years. Findings in patients with RPD, identified through <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.alzheimers.gov%2Ftaking-action%2Fnational-research-centers&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeWidt.Lynda%40mayo.edu%7C01e3d5ed25404a72ef7508dd204e7812%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638702243568200049%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=EPwSTtRW86v3%2BsGbL9%2BLJFWKX%2BKnUyi2UKWZilAJDuA%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers</a> studies nationally, will be compared with data from participants with typical progressive Alzheimer's disease and ADRD enrolled in studies at the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/alzheimers-disease-research-center/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Mayo Clinic</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team hopes to learn how factors such as age, sex, medical history, structural and social determinants of health, genetic variants and other brain changes may make some patients more susceptible to rapid decline. Findings will be validated through expansive protein analyses in cerebrospinal fluid from an independent group of patients with autopsy-confirmed rapid progressive Alzheimer's disease and ADRD. Results will be extended to identify biomarkers and disease-modifying targets that may improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease and ADRD.</p>



<p>"This project represents a substantial investment from NIH to study patients with RPD," says Dr. Day. "We hope the results of our research will inform new approaches, diagnostic tests and treatment targets that will improve outcomes in patients with AD/ADRD. The ultimate goal is to slow down the pathologic progression of disease in these patients, independent of their rate of decline."</p>



<p>The research will combine Mayo Clinic's expertise in digital innovation and telemedicine to engage patients across the United States. This study will also leverage Mayo's Clinical Trials Beyond Walls program, which allows patients to complete some, if not all assessments from the comfort of their own homes or local community facilities. The decentralized clinical trials initiative is designed to remove barriers to clinical trial participation by providing digital solutions and remote services to reimagine the trial experience for all involved, including participants, investigators, study teams and clinical care providers. Decentralized research ― studies conducted outside the walls of traditional research facilities ― may use a wide range of technologies and services such as telehealth, remote monitoring, mobile phlebotomy, retail pharmacy and home healthcare.</p>

<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39503653/#:~:text=Conclusions%3A%20A%20history%20of%20HDP,addition%20to%20traditional%20risk%20factors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A new study</a> has revealed a significant link between a common pregnancy complication and early heart disease in women.</p>



<p>Researchers found that women with a history of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) were at higher risk of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a> at an earlier age. In addition, they found that women with these disorders were at higher risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cardiovascular-diseases/news/advancing-the-understanding-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-myocardial-infarction-with-no-obstructive-coronary-artery-disease-minoca/mac-20574642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA</a>) — heart attacks that occur when the coronary arteries appear normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) — such as gestational hypertension, chronic hypertension and preeclampsia — affect 15% of women during their reproductive years. Marked by high blood pressure, the effects of these disorders continue to impact the health of mothers and babies well after pregnancy.</p>



<p>Compared to women with a history of normotensive (normal blood pressure) pregnancies, women in this study with a history of HDP were at greater risk for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Early onset of coronary artery disease: Occurring on average seven years earlier among women with a history of HDP.</li>



<li>More severe atherosclerotic coronary artery disease: Twice as likely among women with a history of HDP.</li>



<li>Increased risk of MINOCA: Twice as likely among women with a history of HDP.</li>
</ul>

<p>"This research highlights the need for earlier screening for heart disease among women with a history of high blood pressure in pregnancy, particularly for MINOCA, which is up to five times more common in women than in men," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/garovic-vesna-d-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vesna Garovic, M.D., Ph.D</a>., a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>To improve patient care and outcomes for women, the researchers say clinicians should not only screen for traditional coronary artery disease risk factors, but they should also screen for non-traditional risk factors associated with MINOCA and other non-obstructive types of coronary artery disease, such as stress, autoimmune diseases — and now, HDP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does high blood pressure in pregnancy lead to coronary artery disease?</strong></h2>



<p>According to the researchers, there are two related types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/small-vessel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small vessel heart disease</a> that may make it more likely for women to develop HDP and coronary artery disease:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Microvascular dysfunction: Women with a history of HDP often have this underlying problem, which occurs when the small blood vessels that feed the heart stop working as they should, decreasing blood flow to the heart.</li>



<li>Endothelial dysfunction: This is a problem common to both HDP and coronary artery disease. It occurs when the cells that line the inside of blood vessels malfunction, narrowing instead of dilating.</li>
</ol>



<p>Together, these dysfunctions clog or narrow the arteries and small blood vessels that supply blood to the heart, which can lead to coronary artery disease without any physical blockage (non-obstructive). The researchers think it's possible that these processes may feed on one another, creating an environment where coronary artery disease is more likely to occur.</p>



<p>Further research, including large prospective studies, are needed to understand the mechanisms linking HDP to coronary artery disease, such as specific biomarkers and genetic factors that contribute to increased risk.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A growing body of research on high blood pressure in pregnancy</strong></h2>



<p>Research led by Dr. Garovic, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist, has shown links between HDP and a greater risk for a wide range of health concerns including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>The overall goal of Dr. Garovic's research is to increase understanding of the causes and mechanisms that play a role in the process that leads to HDP. The potential to identify targeted therapies that address the underlying causes of disease may improve treatment options for diseases, such as preeclampsia, that have seen few therapeutic advances in recent decades.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have pioneered an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, called OmicsFootPrint, that helps convert vast amounts of complex biological data into two-dimensional circular images.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Omics is the study of genes, proteins and other molecular data to help uncover how the body functions and how diseases develop. By mapping this data, the OmicsFootPrint may provide clinicians and researchers with a new way to visualize patterns in diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders, that can help guide personalized therapies. It may also provide an intuitive way to explore disease mechanisms and interactions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The details of the tool are published in a new <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39445795/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> in&amp;nbsp;Nucleic Acids Research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Data becomes most powerful when you can see the story it's telling," says Krishna Rani Kalari, Ph.D., lead author of the study and associate professor of biomedical informatics at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</a> "The OmicsFootPrint could open doors to discoveries we haven't been able to achieve before."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Simplifying complex data</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Genes act as the body’s instruction manual, while proteins carry out those instructions to keep cells functioning. Sometimes, changes in these instructions — called mutations — can disrupt this process and lead to disease. The OmicsFootPrint helps make sense of these complexities by turning data — such as gene activity, mutations and protein levels — into colorful, circular maps that offer a clearer picture of what’s happening in the body.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In their study, the researchers used the OmicsFootPrint to analyze drug response and cancer multi-omics data. The tool distinguished between two types of breast cancer — lobular and ductal carcinomas — with an average accuracy of 87%. When applied to lung cancer, it demonstrated over 95% accuracy in identifying two types: adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Small data sets bring big impacts</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study showed that combining several types of molecular data produces more accurate results than using just one type of data.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The OmicsFootPrint also shows potential in providing meaningful results even with limited datasets. It uses advanced AI methods that learn from existing data and apply that knowledge to new scenarios — a process known as transfer learning. In one example, it helped researchers achieve over 95% accuracy in identifying lung cancer subtypes using less than 20% of the typical data volume.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This approach could be beneficial for research even with small sample size or clinical studies," Dr. Kalari says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To enhance its accuracy and insights, the OmicsFootPrint framework also uses an advanced method called SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations). SHAP highlights the most important markers, genes or proteins that influence the results to help researchers understand the factors driving disease patterns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From research to clinical practice</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Beyond research, the OmicsFootPrint is designed for clinical use. It compresses large biological datasets into compact images that require just 2% of the original storage space. This could make the images easy to integrate into electronic medical records to guide patient care in the future.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team plans to expand the OmicsFootPrint to study other diseases, including neurological diseases and other complex disorders. They are also working on updates to make the tool even more accurate and flexible, including the ability to find new disease markers and drug targets.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers and collaborators have described — for the first time — the prevalence of <a href="https://medlineplus.gov/autoimmunediseases.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune diseases</a> in the U.S. Their research, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, reports that about 15 million people are estimated to have one or more of 105 autoimmune diseases. The study also found that autoimmune diseases occur most often in women and identified the top autoimmune diseases by prevalence, sex and age.</p>

<p>"Knowing the number of patients with an autoimmune disease in the U.S. is critical to assess whether these diseases are increasing or decreasing over time and with treatment," says the study's corresponding author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>, vice-chair of translational research for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/home/orc-20121930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Cardiovascular Medicine</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Knowing this number is also critical for funding agencies to raise money and awareness for research into autoimmune diseases as a group and for individual autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis or multiple sclerosis. Knowing which diseases occur more often in males or females and at what age is critical in understanding the pathogenesis of disease and how they impact the healthcare system."&amp;nbsp; Dr. Fairweather also leads the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/translational-cardiovascular-disease-research/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Translational Cardiovascular Disease Research Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>To conduct the study, Dr. Fairweather and co-senior author Aaron Abend from the <a href="https://www.autoimmuneregistry.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Autoimmune Registry</a> used electronic health record data from over 10 million patients from six large medical systems in California, Florida, Massachusetts, Iowa, Wisconsin and Missouri who had been diagnosed with at least one of 105 autoimmune diseases considered in the study. They then extended the data to an estimated U.S. population of 333.3 million. The researchers developed a program algorithm to compute the first nationwide prevalence estimate of autoimmune diseases as a category. Dr. Fairweather says previous U.S. estimates were based on meta-analyses and extrapolations for individual autoimmune diseases, which can make estimations of prevalence inaccurate. She says many challenges have existed to obtain accurate prevalence data, including the lack of international consensus on a definition of autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>The findings indicated that about 15 million people, or 4.6% of the U. S. population, were diagnosed with at least one autoimmune disease between January 2011 and January 2022, and that 34% of those individuals were diagnosed with more than one autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>The study also found:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Females (63% of those with autoimmune disease) were almost twice as likely as males (37%) to be diagnosed with an autoimmune disease.</li>



<li>65% of patients had one autoimmune disease.</li>



<li>24% of patients had two autoimmune diseases.</li>



<li>8% of patients had three autoimmune diseases.</li>



<li>2% of patients had four or more autoimmune diseases.</li>
</ul>



<p>The top five diseases based on prevalence were rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, type I diabetes, Graves' disease and autoimmune thyroiditis.</p>



<p>"What dramatically stands out with this assessment is that the most prevalent autoimmune diseases occur in women and autoimmune diseases that occur more often in men occur rarely," says Dr. Fairweather. "This raises important questions that need to be answered with more research. For example, could this be the result of diagnosis bias, or is this a fundamental biological sex difference?"</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather served on a National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) committee on autoimmune diseases and testified before Congress in May 2022 to give recommendations for advancing research in autoimmune diseases. This led to the establishment of a new National Institutes of Health (NIH) <a href="https://orwh.od.nih.gov/in-the-spotlight/all-articles/orwh-announces-formation-of-new-office-of-autoimmune-disease-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Autoimmune Disease Research</a> within the Office of Research on Women's Health. In December 2023, the NIH sought input from members of the scientific community, federal partners, academic institutions, the private sector, health professionals, professional societies, advocacy groups, patient communities and other interested people for the development of an NIH-wide strategic plan to advance autoimmune disease research.</p>



<p>Dr. Fairweather says her team has provided the program algorithm freely to the research community, allowing anyone to leverage this research tool to replicate the study using almost any healthcare database. In addition, researchers can use the tool over time to track shifts in the prevalence of autoimmune diseases, offering valuable insights for future research.</p>



<p>This research was partially funded by a National Institutes of Health grant under award R01 HL164520. For a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding, see the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>.</p>
