<p>A recent Mayo Clinic<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155372502400165X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> study</a> highlights how a new debriefing tool is helping to improve the mental well-being of nurses.</p>



<p>The tool, which goes by the acronym BONE Break, is a structured approach designed to help address the emotional and psychological distress known as Second Victim Syndrome which can be experienced by people within healthcare teams.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-left-align-caption">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Hess-Amberly-R._13600583_20220523-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399598" style="width:246px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Hess-Amberly-R._13600583_20220523-1.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Hess-Amberly-R._13600583_20220523-1-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Amberly Hess, D.N.P.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"Second Victim Syndrome is the emotional toll that can occur after an adverse event in the hospital," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hess-amberly-r-aprn-cns-d-n-p/bio-20578380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amberly Hess, D.N.P.,</a> lead author of the study. "It's the feeling of guilt, self-blame and trauma that can arise when a healthcare worker is involved in or witnesses an adverse patient event."</p>



<p>To understand the debriefing tool's impact, researchers examined its use with registered nurses (RNs) in a 24-bed inpatient unit at Mayo Clinic over a nine-month time frame.</p>



<p>The BONE break tool is designed to be implemented within the first 30 minutes following an event, and to offer peer support and emotional processing to the nurses involved. The nurses who participated reported that they considered over 95% of the sessions helpful.</p>



<p>"One of the most significant insights we gained within the study was the difference between intellectualizing and emotionally processing what happens to us," says Hess.</p>



<p>"When I would run the BONE Break tool, I saw the physiologic changes in nurses," she adds. "I watched the shoulders relax and release tension."</p>



<p>Hess emphasizes that the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> played a pivotal role in developing and evaluating the BONE Break tool.</p>



<p>"The Kern Center provided the framework and allowed the study to grow," says Hess.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Blocker-Renaldo-C.-PhD_15891194_201712180948-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399605" style="width:213px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Blocker-Renaldo-C.-PhD_15891194_201712180948-1.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/Blocker-Renaldo-C.-PhD_15891194_201712180948-1-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Renaldo Blocker, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"The nursing staff brought this study to the Kern Center and the collaboration was great," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/blocker-renaldo-c-ph-d/bio-20121385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renaldo Blocker, Ph.D.,</a>&amp;nbsp;a human factors engineering researcher and senior author of the study.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Dr. Blocker is a Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Honored Investigator and leads a research team on cognitive engineering and neuroergonomics within the Kern Center.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers note that the nurses who participated were responsible for collecting data immediately following each BONE Break session, including the type of event, such as a patient fall.</p>



<p>The BONE Break debriefing process consisted of the following steps.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Buoy/Break:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Nurses took a silent break or short pause to allow for space, then reflected on the statement, "You are a good nurse working in a very complex environment.<a>"</a> Peers then offered support using phrases such as "I cannot imagine what that must have been like for you. Can we talk about it?"</li>



<li><strong>Open-Up:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The nurses then invited each other to talk about the event that had just occurred: "This has to be difficult. Are you OK?" and "How are you doing after the event?<a>"</a></li>



<li><strong>Needs:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Nurses assessed one another’s needs following the event: "What do you need right now to be able to be successful in returning to work?"&amp;nbsp;They offered each other affirmations surrounding those needs: "I believe in you."</li>



<li><strong>Exit/Evaluate:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Afterward, nurses discussed the effectiveness of the debriefing before returning to the floor.</li>
</ul>



<p>"This study highlights the importance of practitioners and scientists working together to evaluate, assess and implement these formative tools," says Dr. Blocker.</p>



<p>Researchers hope to expand the debriefing tool to other healthcare teams.</p>



<p>"This is an easy tool to implement, and it takes just a couple of people to make it happen," says Hess. "If anybody's interested in enhancing the culture of their team, this is a good tool to have available."</p>

<p>When Mayo Clinic approached Phoenix resident Kory Billie about helping researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rusk-annie-m-m-d/bio-20524022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Rusk, M.D.</a>, design a tobacco cessation intervention tailored for Native Americans, he jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>Billie, who has smoked most of his life, understands how using tobacco can negatively affect many aspects of a person's health. He is also a member of the Navajo Nation and has witnessed the challenges that family, friends and other members of his tribe have faced quitting tobacco. In recent years, he has watched the rising use of vaping among Navajo youth with concern. He wants to discourage young people from using tobacco except for ceremonial purposes.</p>

<p class="has-small-font-size">Annie Rusk, M.D.</p>
</div></div>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Billie's experiences made him an ideal candidate to advise Dr. Rusk on her research through a Mayo Clinic program called <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/community/community-engaged-research-program/resources/engagement-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Engagement (CE) Studios.</a></p>



<p>CE Studios is a consultation service that connects researchers to a group of "community experts" who represent the researcher's population of interest. These experts meet with the researcher, usually during a study's planning phase, to learn how the study is being designed, ask questions and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since Mayo Clinic introduced CE Studios in 2021, Dr. Rusk has used it numerous times. She believes community input is essential for all research projects, regardless of their focus.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"By involving people with lived experiences, we can gain valuable insights and ensure our research is relevant and impactful," says Dr. Rusk. "Even discovery science projects taking place in a lab can benefit from community perspectives."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lived experiences provide key insights</strong></h2>



<p>For the CE Studios session with Dr. Rusk, Billie joined three other community experts from tribes in the Midwest, Alaska and Canada in a virtual meeting. The four community experts were there to advise Dr. Rusk on <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20561829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new clinical trial</a>.</p>

</div></div>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Rusk's research focuses on understanding barriers to smoking cessation among Native Americans. She felt it was important to consult with people from a variety of Indigenous communities to ensure her research aligned with their community health needs and priorities.</p>



<p>Billie says he enjoyed this opportunity to connect with like-minded people from similar backgrounds, and to speak with Dr. Rusk about how tobacco use was affecting communities like his. He shared his experiences with homelessness and addiction, as well as the difficulty of accessing smoking cessation resources in Indian Country.</p>



<p>What Dr. Rusk learned from Billie and the other community experts during the CE Studios session motivated her to make an important change to her study design.</p>



<p>The elements of the study that resonated best with the community experts were those geared toward developing practical behavioral health interventions. Billie and the other experts emphasized that understanding the social and cultural drivers of smoking would be key to achieving meaningful outcomes. &amp;nbsp;"You have to understand a person's environment and the way they're brought up," says Billie.</p>



<p>The community experts were less keen on a genetic analysis component Dr. Rusk had planned to include. They felt this aspect did not align meaningfully with community health priorities. Based on this feedback, Dr. Rusk eliminated this component from her study.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While incorporating this kind of feedback can be challenging, Dr. Rusk says the long-term benefits are worth it for all.</p>



<p>"Science seeking to cure disease and transform the way we deliver healthcare requires a direct connection to the people we serve," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Health is a blessing</strong></h2>



<p>Billie says he appreciated this chance to participate in CE Studios. He hopes that the knowledge he and the other experts shared will give Dr. Rusk the context she needs to develop a tobacco intervention that will have a lasting impact. He looks forward to hearing from her upon completion of the study to see the results.</p>



<p>He encourages other people to consider participating in CE Studios to help advance research to improve the health of their communities. He connects his motivation for this work to a Navajo proverb that reminds his people to live their lives with purpose:</p>



<p>"Remember to walk in beauty. Beauty before you and beauty behind you."</p>



<p>If the community can improve the health of its people today, he says, they will pass that blessing on to future generations.</p>

<p>Scientists have developed polygenic risk scores to analyze multiple genetic variants across a person's genome. These scores assess the likelihood of developing conditions such as heart and lung diseases, diabetes, asthma, and certain cancers.</p>

<p>"There's really no one singular variant in the genome that causes common diseases. It's really a lot of different variants across the genome, across our genomes that have weaker or milder effects on disease risk, but all together give us this increased risk," explains Dr. Ortega.</p>



<p>"With those discoveries, we've developed genetic risk scores, polygenic risk scores, where we bring together the effects or associations across variants, across entire genomes into a singular score," he continues.</p>



<p>Clinicians can then utilize these risk scores to potentially customize prevention and treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"These are quite early in development, but are potentially really, really important," says Dr. Wain. "In the future, we could use these to improve diagnosis where somebody is already presenting with the disease, but they need a specific diagnosis in order to access the medicines that are going to work for them." Dr. Ortega says the potential of polygenic risk scores is both exciting and promising.

<p>Krabbe disease is a rare, <a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/leukodystrophy#:~:text=Krabbe%20disease%20(also%20called%20globoid,disease%2C%20is%20symptomatic%20and%20supportive." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inherited neurological disease</a> that most commonly affects infants, but can also present later in life, including during adolescence and very rarely in adulthood, according to the NIH's National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Current clinical laboratory testing identifies individuals with Krabbe disease, but it is challenging to provide a prognosis of the disease course. Symptoms include mental and motor skill weakness and deterioration, seizures, blindness and deafness.</p>



<p>"There's a need for biomarkers that can help differentiate infantile from later-onset forms of disease in a presymptomatic individual," said <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/oglesbee-devin-ph-d/bio-00092599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devin Oglesbee, Ph.D.</a>, a consultant in the Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics’ Clinical Biochemical Genetics Laboratory. "Developing new clinical assays for rare genetic disorders will help us get treatments to patients faster and before irreversible symptoms appear."</p>

<p><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> predoctoral candidate Rachel Wurth is working with Dr. Oglesbee and the Clinical Biochemical Genetics Laboratory on research that aims to discover new disease biomarkers that will complement current laboratory testing to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of Krabbe disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our laboratory has a longstanding interest to improve the diagnosis of Krabbe disease," says Wurth. "My project aims to continue this effort by evaluating changes in many metabolites at once with a technique called untargeted metabolomics. Being able to conduct this research within the clinical laboratory provides an exciting opportunity to streamline translation and allow patients to benefit from research findings more quickly."</p>



<p>The outcomes of this research could lead to improvements in the diagnosis of Krabbe disease, predicting the course of disease and improving understanding of what changes in metabolism contribute to the condition.</p>



<p>Wurth recently was awarded a multi-year grant from Minnesota-based <a href="https://rosenaufoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rosenau Family Research Foundation</a>. Paul and Susan Rosenau's granddaughter lost her battle with Krabbe disease at 2 years of age. Their family’s foundation specifically supports research on Krabbe disease and cystic fibrosis.&nbsp;The award is $112,718 over two years.</p>

<p>Antibody-drug conjugates are targeted cancer therapies. They deliver potent drugs directly into cancer cells while minimizing harm to healthy tissue. These therapies work by recognizing specific proteins found on the surface of cancer cells.</p>



<p>The proteins function like a lock and the therapy acts as a key, latching onto the cancer cells with precision to deliver the treatment.</p>



<p>But precision alone isn’t enough. Even when the key fits the lock, the door often stays closed. This prevents the drug from entering the cell to attack the cancer.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a pioneering strategy that may help overcome this barrier. The approach combines antibody-drug conjugates with proteolysis-targeting chimeras. These molecular tools break down specific proteins to improve how cancer cells internalize the cancer-fighting therapy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-024-07439-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical study</a>, published in Communications Biology, the combined therapy improved the internalization of these treatments by up to 1.9 times in certain models.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The ability to target specific proteins and improve drug absorption into tumor cells represents a significant step forward in how we approach aggressive cancers," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mansfield-aaron-s-m-d/bio-20116851" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Mansfield, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist and lead author of the study at the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Individualized Medicine</a> and the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Mansfield and his team tested the approach using breast cancer organoids. They created these miniaturized, lab-grown versions of breast tissue to mimic the complexity of real tumors. Unlike traditional cell cultures, organoids better replicate how tumors behave in the body.</p>



<p>Specifically, the research focused on three proteins often found in aggressive cancers. These include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET). These proteins are associated with breast, lung and pancreatic cancers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the study highlights the versatility of this approach by demonstrating potential benefits across multiple cancer types and protein targets.&amp;nbsp;</p>

Obesity can be a barrier to liver transplant. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Julie Heimbach</a>, director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a>&nbsp;in Rochester, Minnesota, says that combining gastric sleeve surgery, a type of bariatric surgery with liver transplantation is effective in addressing both health issues.</p>



<p>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/digestive-diseases/news/positive-patient-outcomes-associated-with-liver-transplant-plus-sleeve-gastrectomy-combination/mac-20458505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dual procedure</a>&nbsp;is especially helpful for patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. MASLD happens when fat builds up in the liver, often without symptoms. It's mostly caused by obesity — defined as a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher. In advanced stages, MASLD can lead to serious liver damage that requires a transplant.</p>

<p>"Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease is the most common liver disease, not only in the United States but worldwide," says Dr. Heimbach.</p>



<p>As obesity rates rise, so does the need to treat patients with MASLD.</p>



<p>"When we have excess fat that builds up in the liver, this can lead to inflammation and scarring and even advanced liver disease," she says.</p>



<p>It won't cause complications for everyone, but, for some, it can progress to cirrhosis.</p>



<p>"When a patient develops&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487%20?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cirrhosis,</a>&nbsp;they can then need a liver transplant," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>



<p>And having extra weight can be a reason patients might not be eligible for transplant. At Mayo Clinic, the approach is to help patients with obesity as well as transplant.</p>

<p>"We consider both liver transplant and what's called a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleeve-gastrectomy/about/pac-20385183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleeve gastrectomy,</a> which is a type of weight-loss operation that can be used as a tool to help patients be successful in managing not only their liver disease with a liver transplant, but their obesity with the sleeve gastrectomy," Dr. Heimbach explains.</p>



<p>The procedures are done simultaneously with multiple teams working together. Dr. Heimbach says it's about providing patients the care they need.</p>



<p>"I'm excited about what transplant offers to all of our patients, which is to be able to return to the life that they had before they got sick. And for patients who were carrying extra weight, not only are they healthy again, but now they're able to really fully enjoy and be fully participating in their life," she says.</p>

<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-ed40a55bf59e69bf7d15c35b321a0839"><em> A 3D animation of the region of the brain called the motor thalamus (shown in red and yellow) where Mayo Clinic researchers detected more precise information about brain cell activity in patients during deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS electrodes are placed into the motor thalamus to treat movement disorders.</em></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic researchers have found a new way to more precisely detect and monitor brain cell activity during deep brain stimulation, a common treatment for movement disorders such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parkinson's disease</a> and tremor. This precision may help doctors adjust electrode placement and stimulation in real time, providing better, more personalized care for patients receiving the surgical procedure.<br></h2>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS) involves implanting electrodes in the brain that emit electrical pulses to alleviate symptoms. The electrodes remain inside the brain connected to a battery implanted near the collarbone and controlled by a remote control. While a neurologist and neurosurgeon monitor the brain waves throughout the surgery, the monitoring typically is limited to a narrow frequency range that provides a rough snapshot of brain activity.</p>



<p>However, Mayo Clinic researchers used more sensitive, research-grade equipment and custom algorithms to record a broader frequency range of brain cell activity that yielded higher resolution and more precise information on when and where brain cells were firing in patients during DBS surgery.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Klassen-Bryan-T.-MD_14357470_201505061157-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399245" style="width:214px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Klassen-Bryan-T.-MD_14357470_201505061157-1.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Klassen-Bryan-T.-MD_14357470_201505061157-1-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bryan Klassen, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We looked at brain activity in a different way and recorded a type of brain signal called 'broadband' that reflects the combined activity across all frequencies and is related to the firing of all brain cells in that region. We found that the broadband activity signal increased with movement and was more precise in location than the standard, more narrow frequency signal," says neurologist <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/klassen-bryan-t-m-d/bio-20055332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryan Klassen, M.D.</a>, lead author of the <a href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/jn.00419.2024?checkFormatAccess=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in the Journal of Neurophysiology.</p>



<p>Dr. Klassen and colleagues detected the broadband signal in the motor thalamus, a region deep within the brain that controls movement. Previous studies have detected it only on the surface of the brain.</p>



<p>The researchers recorded broadband signals associated with hand movement in 15 patients undergoing awake DBS. Each of the patients were instructed to open and close their hands while the researchers recorded brain cell activity in their thalamus.&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Baker-Matthew-R._21449571_201907030220-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-399246" style="width:208px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Baker-Matthew-R._21449571_201907030220-1.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/01/Baker-Matthew-R._21449571_201907030220-1-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Baker, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This study enhances our understanding of how the thalamus, a brain region that is frequently targeted for deep brain stimulation, processes movement. It may lead to more precise mapping of the brain as well," says Mayo Clinic coauthor Matthew Baker, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in the neurosurgery department.</p>



<p>Using broadband to monitor during DBS surgery may improve the treatment and outcomes for patients.</p>



<p>"These findings underscore the remarkable advances we can achieve through the close collaboration between the neurology and neurosurgery departments and will help us develop the next generation of brain stimulation therapies," says neurosurgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/miller-kai-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20456021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai Miller, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The next steps for this research involve further exploring how these brain activity patterns in the thalamus can be used to improve neurostimulation therapy, says Dr. Baker, a recent graduate of <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>.</p>



<p>"We will be investigating how this signal responds to different types of movements and whether we can use it to control new devices that only stimulate when patients need it, as opposed to constant stimulation, which is more prone to cause side effects," he says.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39601636/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organoid models</a> to study <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20372371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uveal melanoma</a>, one of the most common types of eye cancer in adults. Their goal is to use these models to better understand how this disease works and develop treatments for unmet patient needs.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/core-resources/stem-cell-organoid-core/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Organoids</a> are 3D models grown from patient tissue that accurately reflect a patient's unique genetic and biological characteristics, also known as "avatars." When derived from a patient's cancer tumor, an organoid will behave and respond to treatments outside the body in a lab (in vitro) just like the original tumor would inside the body (in vivo).</p>



<p>In 50% of patients, uveal melanoma metastasizes, spreading to other parts of the body, leading to a poor prognosis and average survival of less than two years.&amp;nbsp; Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eye-melanoma/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20372376" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current treatments</a> for this condition often have limited effectiveness, leaving patients and their doctors with few options.</p>



<p>"The hope is that these patient-derived organoid models better represent human cancer in the laboratory," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dalvin-lauren-a-m-d/bio-20473890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lauren Dalvin, M.D.,</a> a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> ocular oncologist and surgeon-scientist who is one of the lead researchers. "Using these models as a foundation for drug testing will facilitate new treatment discoveries with higher success rates in clinical trials, ultimately translating to improved outcomes for patients with uveal melanoma."</p>

<p>In the past, the lack of human disease models representing the entire spectrum of uveal melanoma has created a bottleneck, limiting the ability of scientists to identify effective targets for treatment and prevention. Most laboratory studies have drawn from the same set of commercially available cell lines, which are not representative of the disease and often differ in important ways from the original tumors.</p>



<p>To blast through this bottleneck, a study team led by Dr. Dalvin, in collaboration with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fernandez-zapico-martin-e-m-d/bio-00027450" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Martin Fernandez-Zapico, M.D.,</a> a cancer biologist with Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, decided to develop a new, uveal melanoma patient-derived organoid biobank. Their goal is to create a research resource representing the real-world variability of this cancer.</p>



<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39601636/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a paper</a> published in Investigative Ophthalmology &amp;amp; Visual Science, they described the initial development of this biobank. The researchers successfully created organoids derived from Mayo Clinic ocular oncology patients who enrolled in a prospective study involving the collection of tumor tissue for research from July 1, 2019, through July 1, 2024. Their study determined that these organoid models:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Could be generated, retained their stability through many uses and were a renewable living resource capable of being regenerated at need.</li>



<li>Retained the clinically relevant features of the original tumors, clustered into appropriate molecular groups based on validated prognostic markers and resembled human disease when compared to in vivo animal models.</li>



<li>Served as suitable human models for drug screening.</li>
</ul>

Under a microscope, the lab-grown cells look very similar to the original tumor. Importantly, a key feature of the tumor, related to a protein called BAP1, is also consistent.  Images at right show two organoids examined using immunofluorescence to highlight different parts of the cells. The presence of these stains in specific locations within the cells confirms that the lab-grown organoids are derived from melanocytes, which are the cells that produce pigment in the eye. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Recognizing the immense value of this organoid biobank, the investigators have already begun expanding it to include other research centers. Their goal is to create a resource capable of representing the global epigenomic variability of uveal melanoma. In the future, they hope this biobank will serve as a comprehensive platform for drug screening and other types of lab research on uveal melanoma. This collaborative effort will accelerate research and pave the way for improved treatments and outcomes for patients with this disease.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Mayo Clinic organoid research across the spectrum of disease</h2>



<p>Organoids are transforming the landscape of biomedical research. Scientists are using this innovative approach to model diseases, track their progression and identify and characterize potential treatments. Mayo Clinic is at the forefront of organoid research, applying this approach to study a wide range of health conditions including:</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I'm hearing more about the exposome and the role of the environment on our health. Can you tell me more about how it is being studied? I'm worried about the future when I read about studies that show microplastics and chemicals accumulating in our environment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/genomics/2022/09/06/from-the-genome-to-the-exposome/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&amp;nbsp;defines the exposome as the measure of all environmental exposures, from prenatal stages through a person's lifetime, and how those exposures interact with genetic factors to affect health. The term is very inclusive. It includes, for example, diet; pollution; and natural substances, such as radiation. Everyone's exposome is unique.</p>



<p>I appreciate your concern about <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/exploring-the-exposome/">environmental exposures.</a> The point I like to make is that not all exposures are harmful. Some exposures may protect us from disease. When we're talking about the exposome, it includes elements that are a risk for health, such as tobacco use, and elements protecting us from illness, such as access to green space.</p>



<p>Historically, researchers have studied some environmental exposures. Epidemiological studies in the past have told us that excessive alcohol use, for example, has an effect on the human body, and this relates to disease. We have also known that exposures to some bacteria cause disease, such as salmonella or tuberculosis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Graphic: The exposome is the measure of a person's lifetime of environmental expsures and impact on health.
" class="wp-image-386729" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But given that there are millions of different types of environmental exposures, better and more systematic studies are needed to understand what this means to our health.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As a scientific field, the exposome explores exposures that have an effect on humans biology. For me, as a physician and researcher, I would like to know more about exposures that affect our genes, cells and organs, or, in other words, how exposures affect human biology. Your exposome is the environmental complement to your complete set of DNA, called your genome.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have more recently realized that only about 15% of most disease risk can be attributed to genetic elements. So we are left with the question: What else contributes to disease? Families, of course, share not only genes but their environment. They live in the same household. And this is how exposome science started, to try to be able to assess environmental exposures.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last roughly 50 years, chemicals have been mass produced by humans. Decades ago, we couldn't measure chemicals in our bloodstream in a scalable and affordable way. So we used questionnaires to ask, "Do you smoke?" "Do you drink?" "Have you been exposed to pesticides?" We were looking for the outcomes of those exposures to human health.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in my laboratory, we were studying a rare liver disease called&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a>, and we asked a decade ago whether patients were exposed to pesticides, as well as other environmental elements. But the questionnaires didn't show a difference between healthy people and those with primary sclerosing cholangitis.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, when we could use blood tests to measure chemicals in the bloodstream, we found a significant difference in a specific pesticide present among primary sclerosing cholangitis patients compared with healthy people.</p>



<p>So, based on several studies, we now know that pesticides are in our food chain and in our bloodstream in small amounts, and we need to know how they affect human biology and disease.</p>



<p>Also, massive plastic production within the last 70 years also has created microparticles that can be found inside people's tissues. We need to study these exposures both in health and in diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory illness and autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, when we do studies, often we find chemicals that are more prevalent in healthy people compared to patients with diseases. Scientists are working to identify those elements associated with wellness or with a lack of disease because these substances may protect us from illness. For example, some studies have shown that drinking coffee may reduce risk of neurological disease or liver disease. We need to understand this in more depth for therapeutic opportunities.</p>



<p>Current methodologies enable us to measure the exposome better than before through blood, urine, saliva and hair. I envision that 10 years from now, if not earlier, we will have screens of exposures that we will measure in our bloodstream. That will become part of a person's care at some point in the future and help us guide lifestyle changes, prevention strategies and make diagnosis as well as treatment decisions for patients. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lazaridis-konstantinos-n-m-d/bio-20054459"><strong><em>Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterology/Hepatology and Center for Individualized Medicine</em></strong></p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a targeted therapy that could bring relief to people living with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lichen-planus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lichen planus</a>, a chronic inflammatory skin condition of the skin, hair, nails, mouth and genitals.</p>



<p>They described their findings in a study recently published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/179436" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a> that described their first-in-human, phase 2 clinical trial.</p>



<p>The researchers identified unique molecular and cellular changes in the skin with lichen planus, particularly an overactive immune response involving specific types of T cells, a crucial immune system component.</p>



<p>The researchers then used baricitinib, a medication that selectively blocks the specific inflammatory pathways of lichen planus, to treat patients in the study.</p>



<p>Cytokines are small proteins that are crucial in controlling the growth and activity of other immune system cells and blood cells. They include interferon-gamma, a critical signal in normal antiviral responses and aberrant in lichen planus, which leads to immune cells attacking normal cells.</p>

<p>Janus kinase (JAK) enzymes play a crucial role in the body's inflammatory response. Baricitinib is an oral JAK 1/2 inhibitor that interrupts the signaling pathway of interferon-gamma by blocking these enzymes. This helps reduce inflammation and suppress the overactive immune response that contributes to these conditions.</p>



<p>The patients with treatment-refractory disease experienced early and sustained clinical response to the treatment, resulting in an 83% improvement in symptom responsiveness within 16 weeks of treatment, a marked improvement over baseline. The therapy also rapidly reduced interferon activity, a key signaling molecule in the disease, as well as reduced the specific, pathogenic T-cells.</p>

<p>"This research is an important step in connecting the dots in understanding — and treating —autoimmune and inflammatory diseases," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mangold-aaron-r-m-d/bio-20537781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron R. Mangold, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study. "These findings provide a potential new, effective, disease-specific treatment option for lichen planus and therapeutic targets for other inflammatory diseases."</p>



<p>Lichen planus affects 1 to 2% of the general population, altering the quality of life for patients due to intense itching or pain. On the skin, lichen planus often appears as purple, itchy, flat bumps that develop over several weeks. In the mouth and genital mucosa, lichen planus forms lacy white patches, sometimes with painful sores.</p>



<p>Treatment of lichen planus is challenging, and therapeutic options have remained stagnant. To date, researchers have not developed any disease-specific medications for lichen planus. While there is no cure, various treatments can help manage symptoms. However, these treatments can come with common side effects including skin thinning, weakened immune system and increased risk of infection. There is also a need for options for those who don’t respond to treatment. Specific subtypes, such as hypertrophic and mucosal lichen planus, are chronic and may not respond to treatment.</p>



<p>This research provides valuable insights into the pathophysiology of lichen planus and demonstrates the potential of baricitinib as a promising treatment option, says Dr. Mangold, a Mayo Clinic consultant in the Department of Dermatology who studies rare inflammatory conditions and new therapeutics, and conducted an earlier phase 2 Mayo Clinic-led clinical trial to target these cells.</p>
