<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> researcher will share findings from a late-breaking abstract at the <a href="https://suonet.org/meetings/upcoming-meetings.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Society of Urologic Oncology Annual Meeting</a> in Dallas, Dec. 4-6.</p>



<p>The study demonstrated a potentially effective treatment for patients with bladder cancer who no longer respond to the common therapy, <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/22/bladder-cancer-research-is-driving-new-treatment-options-better-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)</a>. The novel treatment, cretostimogene grenadenorepvec, is an oncolytic immunotherapy, meaning it is a virus designed to selectively replicate in and break down cancer cells while simultaneously amplifying the immune response against bladder tumors.</p>



<p>Efficacy data from 110 participants in the study showed that nearly 75% experienced complete cancer remission, with many remaining cancer-free beyond two years. Remarkably, most participants did not require bladder removal surgery, and the treatment was well tolerated with minimal serious side effects. Ongoing research will look to determine the long-term efficacy and whether combining this therapy with other treatments will enhance its effectiveness. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"These findings address a significant unmet need for bladder cancer patients and could improve their quality of life," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tyson-mark-d-ii-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20524031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Tyson, M.D.</a>, urologic oncologist and lead investigator of the study. "We now know this treatment can be both effective and safe, potentially reducing the need for bladder removal surgery and providing a much-needed alternative for patients with limited options."</p>



<p>The <a href="https://suo-abstracts.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/21/details/3706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abstract</a>, "Topline Results: BOND-003 cohort C- A phase 3, single-arm study of intravesical cretostimogene grenadenorepvec for high-risk BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer</a> with carcinoma in situ," will be presented by Dr. Tyson on Thursday, Dec. 5, 11:45–11:50 a.m. CST.</p>

<p>There's a lot of brain power that goes into speech. First, there's a thought or idea, which the brain must translate into words. Those words are then translated into specific movements of the lungs, tongue and mouth to shape the sounds. Those movements then must be perfectly executed and timed with breath. If there's any damage to the brain from a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>&amp;nbsp;or if there's presence of a brain disease, the time of the movements or translation can go wrong. Because of that, changes in voice and speech can provide the first clues to a neurodegenerative disease.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/botha-hugo-m-b-ch-b/bio-20518791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Hugo Botha</a>, a Mayo Clinic behavioral neurologist, explains how voice samples collected for research can help diagnose neurodegenerative diseases early.</p>

<p>"There are some diseases where the very first manifestation is in someone's voice or their speech," says Dr. Botha. Those include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parkinson’s disease</a>; atypical parkinsonism such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-system-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20356153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple system atrophy</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progressive-supranuclear-palsy/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20355668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive supranuclear palsy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/corticobasal-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corticobasal syndrome</a>; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS); <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myasthenia-gravis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myasthenia gravis</a>; and some types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frontotemporal dementia </a>that can result in <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/a-mayo-clinic-expert-explains-aphasia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aphasia</a>.</p>



<p>As part of clinical practice, Mayo Clinic's neurology patients often are recorded when they have their voice or speech examined, which gives clinicians the opportunity to track the disease over time.</p>



<p>"But separate from the clinical practice, we have a large research program at Mayo, where we are collecting voice and speech samples using an application that runs on the person's phone or the laptop computer," Dr. Botha explains.</p>



<p>To collect the voice samples, patients are tasked with running through a series of exams remotely.</p>



<p>"They could do it — say every couple of weeks, every couple of months — so we can really get a longitudinal view of their disease instead of just a snapshot," says Dr. Botha.</p>



<p>The creation of this large and growing speech bank, which securely stores all speech and voice samples, can be used for research, including using it to train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"There are some signals in someone's voice and speech that a computer or an algorithm might pick up on, that a human listener wouldn't pick up on. And so that's more of the sort of research, AI side of things, where we're trying to use hundreds of recordings and patients with various diseases, and then trying to see if the computer can separate those diseases, even though human listeners may not be able to," says Dr. Botha.</p>

<p>Aging can be a balancing act, and according to Mayo Clinic research, your ability to balance on one leg can be a meaningful measure of aging.</p>



<p>"This was a study looking at markers of aging in older adults," explains Dr. Kaufman, senior author of the study and director of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/motion-analysis/overview?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motion Analysis Laboratory</a>&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Forty healthy, independent, community-dwelling people over age 50 underwent various tasks known to be markers of aging, including balance.</p>



<p>"We were comparing different markers of aging and trying to see which one was the most predictive of declines with aging," says Dr. Kaufman.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Standing on one leg</h2>



<p>He says, if someone can stand with all their weight on one leg for 30 seconds, they're doing very well.</p>

<p>"Balance is complicated. It involves many different systems. It involves your vision, your vestibular system, your somatosensory system and your neuromuscular system. All those have to work in coordinated fashion to keep you on one leg," says Dr. Kaufman.</p>



<p>All of those systems deteriorate with age and increase the risk of falls. The good news is it's never too late to improve your balance, it just takes practice.</p>



<p>"The important message is to try it at home. It's very simple, easy to do. It's quick. If you are unable to stand on your leg for five seconds, at least five seconds, then you're at risk of falling," says Dr. Kaufman.</p>

<p><em>Clinicians at Mayo Clinic can use artificial intelligence (AI) tools to effectively screen patients for a weak heart pump via a simple electrocardiogram (ECG). A new study addresses the next question: Is it good value for the money spent?&amp;nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. &amp;nbsp;— <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/trial-demonstrates-early-ai-guided-detection-of-heart-disease-in-routine-practice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier research</a> showed that primary care clinicians using AI-ECG tools identified more unknown cases of a weak heart pump, also called low ejection fraction, than without AI. New <a href="https://www.mcpdigitalhealth.org/article/S2949-7612(24)00104-4/fulltext#keywords-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study findings</a> published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health suggest that this type of screening is also cost-effective in the long term, especially in outpatient settings.</p>



<p>Incremental <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20373148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drops in heart function</a> are treatable with medication but can be hard to spot. Patients may or may not have symptoms when their heart is not pumping effectively, and doctors may not order an echocardiogram or other diagnostic test to check <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ejection fraction</a> unless there are symptoms. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/noseworthy-peter-a-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20094212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Noseworthy, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and co-author of the study, notes that using AI to catch the hidden signals of heart failure during a routine visit can mean earlier treatment for patients, delaying or stopping disease progression, and fewer related medical costs over time.</p>



<p>According to the study, the cost-effectiveness ratio of using AI-ECG was $27,858 per quality-adjusted life year — a measure of the quality of life and years lived. The program was especially cost-effective in outpatient settings, with a much lower cost-effectiveness ratio of $1,651 per quality-adjusted life year.</p>



<p>The researchers studied the economic impact of using the AI-ECG tool by using real-world information from 22,000 participants in the established <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01335-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EAGLE trial</a> and following which patients had weak heart pumps and which did not. They simulated the progression of disease in the longer term, assigning values for the health burden on patients and the resulting effect on economic value.</p>



<p>"We categorized patients as either AI-ECG positive, meaning we would recommend further testing for low ejection fraction, or AI-ECG negative with no further tests needed. Then we followed the normal path of care and looked at what that would cost. Did they have an echocardiogram? Did they stay healthy or develop heart failure later and need hospitalization? We considered different scenarios, costs and patient outcomes," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/yao-xiaoxi-ph-d-m-p-h/bio-20382281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiaoxi Yao, Ph.D.</a>, a professor of Health Services Research at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>Dr. Yao, who is the senior author of the study, notes that cost-effectiveness is an important aspect of the evaluation of AI technologies when considering what to implement in clinical practice.</p>



<p>"We know that earlier diagnosis can lead to better and more cost-effective treatment options. To get there, we have been establishing a framework for AI evaluation and implementation. The next step is finding ways to streamline this process so we can reduce the time and resources required for such rigorous evaluation," says Dr. Yao.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers will work on a federally funded project to advance research in mental health using big data and machine learning to ultimately improve patient outcomes and personalize treatments.</p>



<p>A grant from the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)</a> is a five-year project on which Mayo Clinic will serve as the data coordination center for the <a href="https://taggs.hhs.gov/Detail/AwardDetail?arg_AwardNum=U24MH136069&amp;amp;arg_ProgOfficeCode=134" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Individually Measured Phenotypes to Advance Computational Translation in Mental Health</a>, or IMPACT-MH, program. Mayo researchers will closely collaborate with other grant awardees to help them understand their research data.&nbsp;Mayo is leading the Data Standards core of the study, implementing data standardization for conditions such as depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, sleep disorders and related mental illnesses. The team will leverage both cutting-edge AI techniques and domain expertise, and the result eventually will lead to better treatments for patients.</p>



<p>Mayo also will develop an ontological, or categorical, representation for the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/research/research-funded-by-nimh/rdoc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Research Domain Criteria</a> established by NIMH as a research framework for mental health disorders. The goal is to improve diagnosis and treatment and hasten cures through new research approaches.</p>



<p>Millions of people suffer from mental illness every year. According to the <a href="https://www.nami.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Alliance on Mental Illness</a>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One in five U.S. adults experiences mental illness each year.</li>



<li>One in 20 U.S. adults experiences serious mental illness each year.</li>



<li>One in six U.S. youth aged 6-17 experiences a mental health disorder each year.</li>
</ul>



<p>There are serious challenges treating mental illness mostly because it is underdiagnosed, under-reported and broadly defined, with a lack of resources available to those who need help, says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cui Tao, Ph.D.</a>, chair of Mayo Clinic's Research <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/artificial-intelligence-informatics/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics</a> and one of the principal investigators of the project. Dr. Tao is the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair of AI and Informatics. </p>



<p>"The field lacks universally accepted, standardized measures for assessing specific conditions, which makes it difficult to aggregate and compare data across studies and settings," says Dr. Tao. In addition, the health system depends on patients' willingness to report their symptoms and follow up with a mental health professional for diagnosis and treatment. These challenges make it difficult to collect and analyze data on various mental health disorders.</p>

<p>The IMPACT-MH program will allow Mayo Clinic scientists to advance artificial intelligence and machine learning so researchers can use the technology to process large data sets on mental health. Researchers will be able to see patterns in illness that could help them identify causes, signs and symptoms while assisting in the selection of the best treatments for patients using refined algorithms.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to establish a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) data ecosystem for IMPACT-MH, facilitating critical aspects of data management and sharing," says Dr. Tao.</p>



<p>Through collaborative efforts and the utilization of advanced data management and analytics techniques, the researchers hope to make significant contributions to the field and advance the understanding of mental health, benefiting patients. The team will work to integrate data from behavioral assessments, clinical records and biological markers, and to generate more precise and objective clinical disease characteristics, Dr. Tao says.</p>



<p>The Mayo team will collaborate with a <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/biomedical-informatics-data-science/news-article/biomedical-informatics-and-data-science-bids-secures-a-dollar788-million-nih-grant-to-advance-mental-health-research-using-ai-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yale University</a> team led by Dr. Hua Xu and a <a href="https://www.upenn.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">University of Pennsylvania</a> team led by Dr. Yong Chen to enhance the impact and reach of the program's efforts.</p>

<p>Hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for managing menopause symptoms, particularly hot flashes, night sweats and sleep disturbances. However, many women hesitate to use hormone therapy due to safety concerns, according to new Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Fmenopausejournal%2Ffulltext%2F9900%2Faddressing_menopause_symptoms_in_the_primary_care.383.aspx&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CSatake.Alison%40mayo.edu%7Cdc7f33a8a8bd4085b34408dced18fd11%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638645938783280366%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=zwpNexZGHXTihjsYsHAQGYf14vnHX3ypF1x9rqd40ME%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>.</p>



<p>These concerns may stem from a 2002 study that showed an increased risk of breast cancer, coronary artery disease, stroke and blood clots from specific hormone therapies such as conjugated equine estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The lingering fear caused by the initial Women's Health Initiative trial results in 2002 has promoted a false belief of a lack of safe options for treating menopause symptoms.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>This has most likely affected how healthcare professionals approach evaluation of menopause symptoms and has also conceivably led to an avoidance of discussions regarding menopause symptoms during primary care visits," says Mayo Clinic endocrinologist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kapoor-ekta-m-b-b-s/bio-20414103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ekta Kapoor, M.B.B.S.</a>, senior author of the new study, published in the journal&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.lww.com%2Fmenopausejournal%2Ffulltext%2F9900%2Faddressing_menopause_symptoms_in_the_primary_care.383.aspx&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CSatake.Alison%40mayo.edu%7Cdc7f33a8a8bd4085b34408dced18fd11%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638645938783296461%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=zDEfHRGImyePuNS9o3UuzfX9nJIyhdR0mlBujWdkn40%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Menopause</a>.</p>



<p>More recent studies have established the relative safety of hormone therapy when started by women in their 50s or those within 10 years of menopause. Also, research indicates estrogen therapy, when administered alone, offers greater benefits and carries a lower risk than the combination of estrogen and progestin. Nonhormone options also are available to treat menopause symptoms.&amp;nbsp;<br><br>Another recent study led by Mayo Clinic researchers found short-term hormone therapy for menopause symptoms did not lead to long-term cognitive impairment among women with good cardiovascular health.</p>

<p>Dr. Faubion says women enter menopause when they've gone a full year without menstruation.</p>



<p>"Perimenopause is the time leading up to that, and for many women, it can last a long time — six to 10 years is possible," Dr. Faubion says.</p>



<p>That's when you may experience irregular periods and a host of symptoms, including hot flashes, night sweats, sleep issues and mood changes.</p>



<p>Dr. Faubion says women also may experience "sexual symptoms — low sexual desire, vaginal dryness, pain with sexual activity."<br><br>She says there's been a lack of education and resources for women regarding menopause. "One reason is that menopause can happen at different ages for women. So anything after age 45 is considered normal for menopause," says Dr. Faubion.</p>



<p>And perimenopause can begin as early as 35.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"In general, women aren't hearing this from their medical providers, which is problematic because, while some women may have no symptoms going into menopause, many women actually have a laundry list of symptoms, and sometimes they're very confusing to sort out," Dr. Faubion says.</p>

<p>The researchers encourage both patients and providers to talk about menopause symptoms, how frequently they occur and what impact they can have on quality of life and work productivity.</p>



<p>"Women are often embarrassed to report the symptoms, so we need to normalize the experience. The goal is to empower women with information that will help them tap into appropriate resources, advocate for themselves and ensure they get on the right treatment plan," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>

<p>On Oct. 14, researchers, community partners and volunteers gathered to celebrate one of Mayo Clinic's longest community-academic partnerships. <a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester Healthy Community Partnership (RHCP</a>) — a research collaboration focused on responding to community-identified health needs affecting immigrants to the U.S. — had just turned 20.</p>



<p>The event featured speakers from Mayo Clinic and the community who shared the story of RHCP’s beginning, its enduring connections to the community, its tremendous influence and its ongoing work.</p>



<p>"Being part of this group has been a blessing," says Yahye Ahmed, a longtime member of RHCP. "It has given me the opportunity to work and serve my community unconditionally."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/public-health/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2022.1090131/full" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A community case study</a> published in Frontiers in Public Health described the history of RHCP and the lessons they’ve learned along the way. It also outlined how RHCP has championed and refined the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), leading to RHCP’s work being nationally recognized as a model for this type of research. At the 2024 Translational Science meeting, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wieland-mark-l-m-d-m-p-h/bio-00093813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Wieland, M.D.,</a> RHCP co-principal investigator, accepted an award on behalf of the partnership honoring it for <a href="https://www.actscience.org/Translational-Science/Awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"Addressing Health Equity Through Partnership and Innovation." </a>&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This award is a testament to the long-term success of RHCP as a nationally recognized research partnership that leverages the expertise of community and academic partners to create meaningful health equity impact, locally and across the country," says Dr. Wieland.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/RHCP-Timeline.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">timeline</a> shared at RCHP's 20<sup>th</sup> Anniversary event highlighted the body of research the partnership has produced, from Let’s Talk About TB (2004-2011) to Healthy Immigrant Families (2010-2018) to a Pandemic Communications Toolkit (launched in 2022 and ongoing).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Research conducted by RHCP has resulted in the development of:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>An effective, sustainable, community-based <a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/all-projects-blog/2017/7/28/lets-talk-about-tb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tuberculosis (TB) prevention and control program</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/all-projects-blog/2017/7/28/club-fit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A childhood obesity prevention program</a> for youth in an after-school program.</li>



<li>Community-informed health care practices, such as <a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/all-projects-blog/2017/7/28/stories-for-change-s4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital storytelling for chronic disease prevention</a>.</li>



<li>Interventions designed to reduce <a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/all-projects-blog/2017/7/28/healthy-immigrant-community" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular risk</a> and <a href="https://rochesterhealthy.org/all-projects-blog/2023/2/14/pandemic-communications-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 health disparities</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>"It's impossible to adequately acknowledge all the thousands of people who have contributed to the success of RHCP," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sia-irene-g-m-d-m-s/bio-00085447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irene Sia, M.D.,</a> founder and co-principal investigator. "Thank you for 20 years of sharing your talents, your cultures, your knowledge, your time and your support."</p>



<p>Dr. Wieland is director of the Community-Engaged Research Program in Mayo Clinic's Center for Clinical and Translational Science. Dr. Sia is a physician in Mayo Clinic's Division of Public Health, Infectious Diseases, and Occupational Medicine.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</a>, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00405-1/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> analyzed DNA from over 100,000 participants from diverse backgrounds, providing important insights into certain genetic predispositions to support personalized and proactive medical guidance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings, focused on pathogenic (disease-causing) and likely pathogenic genetic variants linked to three specific conditions: hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome and familial hypercholesterolemia. Findings revealed that 1.9% of participants — nearly 2,000 people — carried at least one genetic variant that could increase their risk for these diseases. Notably, about 65% of those with a detected variant had no known prior personal or family history of the conditions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For many participants found to carry a genetic variant, the information has been life changing. Some have taken proactive steps, such as undergoing early screenings or preventive surgeries, which in some cases led to early cancer detection or reduced their risk of heart disease.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The implications of the Tapestry study are monumental," says Dr. Lazaridis, the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for the Center for Individualized Medicine. "As this study continues to inform and transform the practice of personalized medicine, it also sets a new standard for how large-scale medical research can be conducted in an increasingly digital and decentralized world."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A monumental, decentralized effort&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Almost as significant as the study's outcome is how it was accomplished. The Tapestry study has been Mayo Clinic's largest decentralized trial, meaning it was conducted remotely through electronic contact, education and consent, with sample collection materials delivered to the participant’s home.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in early 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project overcame unprecedented challenges, including securing consent from over 100,000 of the 1.3 million people invited to participate and mobilizing vast resources.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It was a tremendous effort," Dr. Lazaridis recalls. "The engagement of such a number of participants in a relatively short time and during a pandemic showcased the trust and the dedication not only of our team but also of our patients."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We have also learned valuable lessons about some patients' decisions not to participate in Tapestry, which will be the focus of future publications," he added.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants' saliva samples from all three of Mayo Clinic's campuses — in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida — were used to extract DNA for exome sequencing. Exome sequencing analyzes nearly 20,000 genes that provide instructions for making proteins, which play many critical roles in the body. This is where most known disease-causing pathogenic or likely pathogenic genetic variants occur.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This genetic exploration focused on hereditary conditions such as the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/breast-ovarian-cancer-hereditary/causes/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control</a>, women with these pathogenic genetic variants have a higher likelihood of developing breast and ovarian cancer, while men with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations face an increased risk of breast cancer and a potentially elevated risk of prostate cancer. The study also examined <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/colorectal-cancer-hereditary/about/about-lynch-syndrome.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>, which raises the risk of colorectal and uterine cancers, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familial hypercholesterolemia</a>, known for its impact on early-onset heart disease, heart attacks and stroke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to targeting these well-known conditions, the center’s experts are applying advanced analytics to the Tapestry data in collaboration with investigators across the enterprise. This work aims to explore lesser-known genetic variants that may contribute to a range of other health issues and diseases.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">From data to actionable insights</h2>



<p>These actionable insights are being integrated into participants' health records to guide future medical decisions, such as personalized interventions and regular health screenings to potentially improve patient outcomes.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Genetic counselors have played a crucial role in educating both patients and providers about the implications of their genetic data.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Receiving genetic information can be difficult, but it also empowers patients to take proactive steps for their health," says Jennifer Kemppainen, CGC, supervisor of the Mayo Clinic Genetic Testing and Counseling unit and part of the Tapestry study team. "We help patients understand their results and educate them about screening and management options, so they feel prepared to meet with specialists and make informed decisions about their care."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A repository for tomorrow's cures</h2>



<p>Along with its impact on participants' healthcare, one of the most significant outcomes of the Tapestry study is the creation of a comprehensive genetic data repository. This extensive database has become a valuable resource for Mayo's scientific community, with 118 research requests submitted, that have resulted in the distribution of over 1.1 million exome datasets to interested investigators.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The data repository supports ongoing individual projects and fosters a collaborative environment where researchers can exchange ideas and findings to increase the potential for breakthroughs across different fields of medicine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"What we've accomplished with the Tapestry study is a blueprint for future endeavors in medical science," Dr. Lazaridis says. "It demonstrates that through innovation, determination and collaboration, we can deeply advance our understanding of DNA function and eventually other bio-molecules like RNA, proteins and metabolites, turning them into novel diagnostic tools to improve health, prevent illness and even treat disease."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> is collaborating with the biotech firm <a href="https://hepatx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HepaTx</a> on an experimental therapy to regenerate tissue in patients with late-stage liver disease. This new technology takes mesenchymal stem cells from adipose (fat) tissue and coaxes them to function like hepatocyte (liver) cells. The purpose of the collaboration is to move this technology to early clinical trials and study its effect on people with liver damage from alcohol-related hepatitis.</p>



<p>Mesenchymal stem cells are adult stem cells that have been well studied and have been shown to be safe in humans.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic brings to the collaboration expertise in regulatory affairs, clinical trials, product development and biomanufacturing. HepaTx brings a new cell technology directed toward a disease with few therapeutic options. Together they will work to advance the engineered liver cells to first-in-human safety studies.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Allickson-WF782604_0002-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397191" style="width:300px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Allickson-WF782604_0002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Allickson-WF782604_0002-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Allickson-WF782604_0002.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Our goal in working with industry is to quickly bring a pipeline of cell-based therapeutics to patients with unmet needs," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/allickson-julie-g-ph-d/bio-20523656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Allickson, Ph.D.</a>, chief technology officer at Mayo Clinic's Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics. "This is a very exciting opportunity to pair Mayo Clinic's know-how with a new discovery aimed at improving the health, lives and therapeutic outcomes for patients."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new cell-based therapy for liver disease</strong></h2>



<p>Excessive alcohol use damages and eventually destroys liver cells, causing inflammation that can lead to abdominal pain, scarring and liver failure. Alcoholic hepatitis is one type of chronic liver disease that affects 20-40% of heavy drinkers.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="179" height="179" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Hepatx-Liver-Tech-2024_1x1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397320" style="width:277px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Hepatx-Liver-Tech-2024_1x1.jpg 179w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Hepatx-Liver-Tech-2024_1x1-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 179px) 100vw, 179px" /></figure></div>


<p>In the early stage of liver disease, treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms through a combination of small molecule drugs and quitting drinking. However, in later stages, cell and tissue damage are often irreversible. People with end-stage liver disease may need an organ transplant to survive.</p>



<p>The engineered liver cell technology from HepaTx is so new that it has never been manufactured on a large scale for patients. That's where the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics process development experts come in. They develop standard operating procedures —a blueprint of sorts — for biomanufacturing in Mayo Clinic's state-of-the-art current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) facilities. CGMP refers to a set of practices that ensures a new therapy meets strict quality control and quality assurance standards for medicines made from living sources such as cells.</p>



<p>"We engage with investigators at proof of concept. We guide the technology through process development to identify any gaps in safety that could delay regulatory approval for a clinical trial," says Dr. Allickson. "Our biomanufacturing infrastructure is based on industry best practices, which positions us well to work with outside collaborators to advance a new therapy toward market approval for patients."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic will lead the early clinical trials in which patients with alcohol-related hepatitis will be infused with the engineered liver cells. The research will focus on safety and effectiveness of this cell replacement therapy in repairing late stage disease.</p>



<p>Working with industry collaborators that are aligned with Mayo Clinic values is a strategic priority for the Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has a financial interest in the technology referenced in this article. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.</p>

<p>As you gather around the table this Thanksgiving to share meals, stories and traditions, consider taking a moment to talk about something that could save lives: your family's health history.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanksgiving Day is recognized as <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/family-health-history/about/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Family Health History Day</a>, a national call to raise awareness of inherited health risks. Mayo Clinic experts are encouraging families to use the holiday to identify these risks and take proactive steps toward prevention.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Hereditary conditions range from autoimmune disorders like celiac disease to cancers tied to genetic mutations," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/murray-joseph-a-m-d/bio-20053816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Murray, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic with over 30 years of expertise in treating complex digestive diseases. "Thanksgiving provides a unique opportunity to notice these patterns in your family's health and start conversations that could benefit generations to come."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hereditary links to digestive conditions</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/digestive-system2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397056" style="width:373px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/digestive-system2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/digestive-system2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/digestive-system2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/digestive-system2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/digestive-system2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure></div>


<p>Two conditions Dr. Murray highlights, celiac disease and eosinophilic esophagitis, can have hereditary components but are not always linked to family history.</p>



<p>"Food is central to Thanksgiving, so it's a perfect time to notice who's avoiding certain dishes," Dr. Murray says. "If someone skips bread or mentions swallowing difficulties, it could point to something hereditary."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20352230?customer_id=199-030-3372&amp;amp;mc_id=google&amp;amp;campaign=16975831874&amp;amp;geo=9019562&amp;amp;kw=celiac%20disease%20mayo%20clinic&amp;amp;ad=593694771501&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;sitetarget=&amp;amp;adgroup=135482631493&amp;amp;extension=&amp;amp;target=kwd-346724094689&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;account=1990303372&amp;amp;invsrc=consult&amp;amp;placementsite=minnesota&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrCZKg3OkoT2wsT0T2_zMoR3Z8CC_g4emqPt3PljXSLedwpdaLHIbDYaAlrCEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Celiac disease</a>, an autoimmune condition triggered by gluten, can cause symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, weight loss, anemia, fatigue, skin rashes, mouth ulcers and joint pain. It can be diagnosed at any age and presents in over 300 ways, making testing crucial — especially for those with close relatives at higher risk.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"For siblings, the risk is as high as 20%," Dr. Murray says. "Accurate diagnosis is key, because eliminating gluten without testing can mask other health issues, such as irritable bowel syndrome or lactose intolerance, and delay treatment."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Murray says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/eosinophilic-esophagitis/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20372209?customer_id=199-030-3372&amp;amp;mc_id=google&amp;amp;campaign=12364095989&amp;amp;geo=9019562&amp;amp;kw=eosinophilic%20esophagitis%20mayo%20clinic&amp;amp;ad=499362077185&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;sitetarget=&amp;amp;adgroup=123190878452&amp;amp;extension=&amp;amp;target=kwd-838282939870&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;account=1990303372&amp;amp;invsrc=consult&amp;amp;placementsite=minnesota&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiA6Ou5BhCrARIsAPoTxrAfoV1y7F9smeY6Bfw7FKwjjSi8juZXfAwfHlzPuIjmq1UxhYMvOv8aAo5aEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eosinophilic esophagitis</a> is another condition to be aware of. It involves inflammation of the esophagus that leads to difficulty swallowing or food impaction. In children, symptoms can include vomiting, avoiding certain foods or difficulty gaining weight. In adults, it typically presents as difficulty swallowing or the sensation of food getting stuck, which can sometimes require emergency medical attention. Available treatment options include anti-inflammatory medications and immune-targeted therapies.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Family health history also plays a vital role in cancer and heart disease prevention, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/presutti-r-john-d-o-faafp/bio-20053922?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Presutti, D.O.</a>, a family medicine physician and the Cecilia and Dan Carmichael Family Associate Director for the Center for Individualized Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Florida. In his dual role, Dr. Presutti combines his expertise in primary care with advances in genomics to help patients uncover hereditary risks and take proactive steps.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Presutti also leads Mayo Clinic's pilot program integrating genomic data into clinical care. This initiative offers genomic screening for actionable genetic markers associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, Lynch syndrome and familial hypercholesterolemia. These markers can inform preemptive interventions and allow for personalized care.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Approximately 10% of cancers are inherited," Dr. Presutti says. "Uncovering hidden genetic mutations through family discussions allows us to screen patients earlier and potentially save lives."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome is linked to mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Mutations in BRCA1 can lead to a 60% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 40% risk of having ovarian cancer, among other cancers. BRCA2 mutations increase the risk of developing breast cancer to 50% and ovarian cancer to 20%, with additional risks for prostate and pancreatic cancers in males.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Lynch syndrome is associated with an 80% lifetime risk of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> and 50% risk of uterine/endometrial cancer. Familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic disorder that causes dangerously high cholesterol levels, significantly increases the risk of early heart disease and stroke if left untreated.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>&amp;nbsp;Dr. Presutti encourages families to ask questions such as:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Have any family members had cancer or heart disease?&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>At what age were they diagnosed?&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Are there patterns of chronic illnesses or early deaths in the family?&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li></li>
</ul>

<p>For younger people, family health history can be especially important as rates of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are on the rise among people under age 55. Mayo Clinic's Early Onset and Hereditary Gastrointestinal Cancers Program aims to address this growing concern, says Niloy Jewel Samadder, M.D., a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The rise in young-onset gastrointestinal cancers is a pressing health issue," Dr. Samadder says. "Our goal is to put patients at the center of a collaborative framework of experts working seamlessly together."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Launched in 2024, the program integrates gastroenterology, oncology, surgery, pathology and genetics to provide comprehensive, patient-centered care. Translational discoveries, such as immunology studies and a multi-omics approach, are also part of the program, helping to tailor treatments to a patient's unique biological profile.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This multidisciplinary approach doesn't just address cancer — it uncovers hereditary risks that can guide care for families," Dr. Samadder explains. "It's about creating a roadmap for prevention and better outcomes."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A tradition that saves lives</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you discover something significant about your family health history this Thanksgiving, take action:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Talk to your primary care provider about screening or preventive measures.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Encourage family members to discuss shared health risks with their doctors.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Learn about lifestyle changes or early interventions that could lower your risk.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stay proactive by keeping your health records updated and sharing them with relatives.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>"Don't just talk about your family health history," Dr. Presutti says. "Act on it. It could save your life."&amp;nbsp;</p>
