<p>The central dogma of molecular biology<a> —</a> cited in countless science textbooks — states that DNA is transcribed into RNA, and RNA is translated into proteins. This basic idea is key to understanding how genes are expressed and how to overcome genetic defects that cause disease.</p>



<p>For much of history, researchers have treated diseases by targeting the proteins involved, such as giving insulin for diabetes or statins for heart disease. Over the last couple of decades, however, they have pursued gene therapies that target disease at the level of the DNA, including developing drugs that correct the genetic defect in sickle-cell disease. More recently, researchers have been advancing treatments that go after the often-overlooked molecule RNA. To do so, many are harnessing a technology known as antisense oligonucleotides.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1.jpg"><img decoding="async" width="514" height="735" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-398043" style="width:708px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1.jpg 514w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/ASO-explainer-graphic-1-210x300.jpg 210w" sizes="(max-width: 514px) 100vw, 514px" /></a></figure></div>


<p>RNA molecules act as intermediaries between DNA and protein, but they also do so much more, says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/cousin-margot-a-ph-d/bio-20503541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Margot Cousin, Ph.D.</a>, a translational genomics scientist at Mayo Clinic. There are RNAs that can perform biochemical reactions, and others that can regulate gene expression.</p>



<p>"We're trying to use some of the processes that exist in our body to design these drugs and make them work for us," says Cousin.</p>



<p>Antisense oligonucleotides, or ASOs, are short, synthetic strands of nucleotides designed to bind to complementary RNA sequences like the teeth in a zipper. These ASOs can look and behave differently depending on the type of genetic defect they are designed to target. An estimated 15 to 30 percent of genetic diseases are caused by mutations that disrupt RNA splicing, the process by which stretches of noncoding RNA are removed and the remaining coding regions are spliced back together.</p>



<p>"It's essentially like putting all the beads that you need to make your protein together and getting rid of all the string in between that you don't need," says Dr. Cousin.</p>



<p>Splicing mutations can cause these beads to be put together incorrectly, &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; producing defunct proteins. Dr. Cousin says that researchers can create ASOs to block these mutations and set splicing back on track. For example, the first FDA-approved treatment for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an ASO that modifies the splicing of the SMN2 gene to ramp up the production of functional SMN protein, which is lacking in SMA patients.</p>



<p>Alternatively, mutations can cause a gene to be expressed abnormally or to acquire new properties. In those cases, scientists can design ASOs to specifically bind to the RNA sequences generated by the faulty genes and flag them to be degraded, effectively reducing the production of harmful proteins.</p>

<p>Dr. Cousin and her colleagues are currently assessing this technology for what is known as <em>n</em>=1 cases — those patients with ultra-rare diseases who have no other treatment options.</p>



<p>"These are patients with severe or life-threatening conditions where we know the risk of not treating is greater than the risk of treating with an experimental ASO," she says. "The chemistry of ASOs have already been approved for medicinal use, and their modular nature means that the researchers can simply change the order of the nucleotides to reach a specific target for patients who may benefit from this strategy."</p>



<p>"Our understanding of the human genome and genetic causes of disease continues to grow and therapeutic tools like ASOs are increasingly being pursued to overcome them," said Dr. Cousin. "The study and development of genetic therapies including ASOs will bring precision medicine to those in need with increasing frequency, making them a remarkable drug tool to explore right now."</p>

<p>When Roseanne Nooren began her Ph.D. training four years ago, she found great purpose in studying pancreatic cancer. "Once a person is diagnosed, it may be only months before they pass, and that's largely because of the way the cancer metastasizes," she says. "I thought this was an area of research that could really make a difference." In her thesis research with co-mentors <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/razidlo-gina-ph-d/bio-00096936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gina Razidlo, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mcniven-mark-a-ph-d/bio-00026682" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark McNiven, Ph.D.</a>, at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, she already has made strides in understanding how pancreatic tumors spread. She's also identifying ways to halt the process.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/RoseanneNooren.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397745" style="width:199px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/RoseanneNooren.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/RoseanneNooren-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roseanne Nooren</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Nooren's graduate training included classes about cancer, but Dr. Razidlo suggested Nooren look into an additional opportunity: a course specifically about pancreatic cancer where she could meet others in the field. Nooren applied and was accepted to attend a week-long intensive pancreatic cancer course at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York — a prestigious program that brings together about 30 nationally and internationally known researchers. "I was excited about the idea of the course — and also nervous," she says. "It was an opportunity to meet many scientists whose journal articles I had been reading."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But first, she had to figure out how to attain funding to attend the course. The answer was a special — and until now, anonymous — award earmarked for Mayo’s Ph.D. students.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 1999, graduate students who are eligible to take a specialized course outside Mayo have been able to apply to the graduate school for a competitive travel grant to pay their tuition and expenses. The award was financed by an anonymous benefactor, and nearly 100 students over the years have taken advantage of the opportunity.&amp;nbsp; Students have gone to courses at sites like Woods Hole, Massachusetts, or Jackson Laboratories in Maine, to learn new microscopy techniques or new approaches in genetics. After they return, students send a thank you note for the funding. The donor has been happy to receive a summary from students about what they learned, but otherwise has remained in the shadows.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This year, the source of the funding came to light: two Mayo educators who initiated the grant decades ago. At her family's request, the newly named Lily Weinshilboum Travel Award for Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, honors the memory of the trained anatomist and biomedical researcher who taught at Mayo Clinic for 25 years. Lily Weinshilboum died in 2023 at the age of 86, but the grant she first imagined is continuing to contribute to the success of Mayo's Ph.D. students.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The importance of daring and determination</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the naming of the grant, Lily Weinshilboum's family hopes students will learn about her dedication to biomedical education and her enterprising spirit, says her husband and co-benefactor, Mayo Clinic internist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/weinshilboum-richard-m-d/bio-00025916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Weinshilboum, M.D.</a>, the Mary Lou and John H. Dasburg Professor of Cancer Genomics Research.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="492" height="640" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Lily_Weinshilboum.jpeg" alt="A smiling older woman with glasses." class="wp-image-397743" style="width:216px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Lily_Weinshilboum.jpeg 492w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Lily_Weinshilboum-231x300.jpeg 231w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Lily Weinshilboum </figcaption></figure></div>


<p>As a young woman, Lily Weinshilboum traveled independently to the United States from Taiwan in 1954, determined to advance her interest in science. A scholarship enabled her to attend Ottawa University in Kansas. She went on to train as a neuroanatomist at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and was a teaching assistant in graduate school when she met her husband, who was then a medical student. After completing her master's degree, she worked with a research group in Boston and later in a lab at the National Institutes of Health as Dr. Weinshilboum completed his training. The Weinshilboums came to Mayo Clinic in Rochester in 1972 for the next stage of their careers. Lily Weinshilboum's outgoing and nurturing personality made her a dynamic anatomy instructor in the medical school, where she connected with students as they embarked on their training and began to recognize the importance of their roles in patients' lives.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Daring and determination were themes in her life. Once she had retired, she came up with the idea for a fund to help graduate students take an extra step on their career paths. "She wanted to help graduate students gain perspective, learn new topics and begin to create networks with researchers by attending meetings that stretched beyond what was readily available at Mayo," says Dr. Weinshilboum, who serves as a Ph.D. mentor and dissertation advisor for graduate students. "We viewed the travel grants as one way we could help."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Former graduate students — now established researchers and educators — attest to the lifelong impact of those experiences. Regenerative science researcher and dermatologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/wyles-saranya-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20476857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saranya Wyles, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, received travel funding in 2014 during her training in Mayo's <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/medical-scientist-training-program-md-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Medical Scientist Training Program</a>. The money allowed her to attend a meeting in the United Kingdom focused on genetic engineering of stem cells. "Attending this event as a graduate student was a defining moment in my journey in regenerative medicine research," she says. "It reinforced my commitment to this field and paved the way for my current role as a research laboratory leader. Now I have the privilege of training Ph.D. and M.D.-Ph.D. students, and I encourage them to seek out similar opportunities and apply for the grant as well."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gaining confidence and building a network</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>For Nooren, the meeting earlier this year at Cold Spring Harbor already has been a game-changer. The week of lectures gave her ideas that she brought back to her research in Dr. Razidlo's lab, including a new approach in microscopy that will expand her work. She gained confidence as she gave a presentation of her own research findings and joined scientific conversations with seasoned scientists. "It made me braver, just feeling that my questions were valid and that I could bring my expertise," she says. "Even in graduate seminars now, I'm more confident, and when we discuss works in progress, I'm more likely to raise my hand and say, 'Hey, have you tried this?'"&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Nooren also met like-minded colleagues as she learned about other pancreatic cancer labs around the country and met potential future collaborators. She hopes other students will apply for the grant to attend a course that expands their own research interests. "It's such an opportunity to connect, even though you're a student and you're at the first stages of becoming a scientist," she says. "You're learning and interacting with everyone, and you're all putting your heads together to try to solve the problems in the field. It was an amazing experience."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That's exactly what Mrs. Weinshilboum intended in establishing the award, says Dr. Weinshilboum.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"She read students' summary notes with great interest and a great sense of pride in having been able to help make these experiences possible," he says. "She was focused on training the next generation and encouraging them to do bold things."</p>

<p>Richard Casper was one of the study participants. The Arizona man enrolled in the clinical trial at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix after his diagnosis of glioblastoma in 2019. Richard was given only months to live, but his family says thanks to his strength, perseverance, and innovative medical care, he survived nearly double the amount of time.</p>



<p>"To be almost two and a half, three years in after being told you only have a few months, it's quite remarkable," says Susan Casper, Richard's daughter.</p>



<p>Richard succumbed to the disease in 2023. During the treatment, his family says he had little to no side effects. In the months before his passing, Richard stated, "I feel great. If someone didn't tell me I have the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-learn-about-meningioma-and-glioblastoma-brain-tumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a>, I wouldn't even know it."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why is glioblastoma so deadly?</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/glioblastoma-in-older-adults-improving-survival-and-quality-of-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Glioblastoma</a> is among the most challenging cancers to treat. The disease is aggressive and invades healthy brain tissue with hairlike tentacles. "That is why doing a complete surgery is very difficult, as compared to say <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, where a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> can be performed to remove not only the tumor, but a healthy rim of tissue around it," explains Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Surgery for glioblastoma presents a different set of obstacles. "When it comes to glioblastoma, it is challenging to do that level of surgery. You try to surgically remove whatever you can safely without leaving the patient worse off after surgery."</p>



<p>Another factor that makes glioblastoma so lethal is that it can be fast- growing and unresponsive to treatment. </p>



<p>"These cancer cells are quite challenging to overcome," says Dr. Vora. "There are some patients we see after their surgery, and by the time we are ready to start their treatment, they've already had a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/connect-with-other-patients-who-have-fear-of-cancer-recurrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a> of the disease."</p>

<p>An estimated 14,500 people will be diagnosed with glioblastoma in the U.S this year. "In the best of circumstances the average survival rates are in the 14-15 month range. But for patients 65 and older, the group that was the focus of our study, patients do even worse. The prognosis for this population is between six and nine months," says Dr. Vora.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Attacking glioblastoma with a triad </strong></h2>



<p>For the clinical trial, Dr. Vora and his team mapped out a plan that would allow them to be more intentional and precise with treating the location of the glioblastoma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397931" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-300x163.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-768x417.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1536x834.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-2048x1112.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"It is the triad of metabolic imaging, proton beam therapy and hypofractionation, which is a shorter course of radiation that might be the best combination to treat glioblastoma in the 65-and-older patient population."</p><cite>Dr. Sujay Vora, radiation oncologist &amp;amp; Principal study investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The imaging incorporated the use of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. "<sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET is an amino acid tracer that can cross the blood brain barrier, and it can accumulate within the glioblastoma cells itself," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Researchers combined these images to determine the location of the most metabolically active "hot spots" of the cancer in the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking aim with proton beam therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Study investigators used one of the most advanced forms of radiation treatment, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>. </p>



<p>"With standard <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/living-with-cancer-what-is-radiation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a>, the beams go through the brain tissue, so there's an entrance dose and the exit dose. But with proton beam therapy, we dial up how deeply we want the radiation to go," explains Dr. Vora. "It drops off its energy in the tumor, and then there's basically no radiation after that. It allows us to be more preferential into the delivery of radiation and protect more of the healthy surrounding tissue."</p>

<p>During proton beam therapy, a patient lies on a table while the machine rotates around the patient's head targeting the tumor with an invisible beam. The patient is awake for the procedure. It is painless with many patients reporting fewer to no side effects.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional radiation for glioblastoma, which is typically delivered over the course of three to six weeks, treatment with proton beam therapy for the study was conducted in one to two weeks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="515" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-1024x515.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397937" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-1024x515.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-300x151.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-768x387.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-1536x773.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-2048x1031.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Patient undergoing proton beam therapy</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I am hopeful that this is the first step of many where we can continue to move the needle and allow patients to live longer and live well," says Dr. Vora. "The goal is to improve the outcomes for our patients allowing them to spend more time with their families."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nadya's story</strong></h2>



<p>2022 was a tough year for Nadya El-Afandi. She was on the verge of celebrating a long but successful battle with breast cancer.</p>



<p>"Out of the blue, I had a seizure. I went to the hospital, they did an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-questions-about-mri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>.  After additional tests they told me the news: 'You have a glioblastoma,'" recalls Nadya. She asked her doctor if she should continue her breast cancer treatment. "He said, 'No'-meaning the glioblastoma would kill me before the breast cancer."</p>



<p>Nadya was not about to give up.</p>

<p>Nadya is a wife and mother of four children. She lives just outside of Rochester, Minnesota. "My children said to me, 'Mom, you're a unicorn. Of course you'll live.' My mother has had a number of medical conditions and we never expected her to live this long. And she's still alive and with us," says Nadya. "My children have also said, 'You've got grandma's blood in you. You will live.'"</p>



<p>Nadya is receiving care at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>. That's where she learned about a new clinical trial called SAGA, or stereotactic ablative radiation treatment for glioblastoma. The phase 2 clinical trial is building upon Dr. Vora's research and studying a larger group of patients. The study is being led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Dr. William</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Breen</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Our goal is to transform the way we treat glioblastoma - in that we are using advanced imaging to help us better target the tumor. We're looking at shorter courses of radiation to minimize the burden on patients and their families and hopefully complete effective and safe treatment in a shorter amount of time.</p><cite>William Breen, M.D., Radiation Oncologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It has been 15 months since Nadya began treatment for glioblastoma. So far, there is no sign the glioblastoma has returned. "Nadya has already exceeded the time that's expected time to have a tumor recurrence, and she continues to do well," says Dr. Breen. "Nadya is beyond some measures of what the average, overall survival time would be."</p>



<p>While Nadya's progress in encouraging, Dr. Breen says it is important to note that it is too early to draw any conclusions about safety or efficacy of this approach to treatment until the study is completed.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nadya is focused on living her life to the fullest. Fifteen months after undergoing treatment, Nadya embarked on an adventure to Hawaii, where she spent time taking helicopter tours, snorkeling and hiking.</p>

<p>PHOENIX — You may be familiar with a range of tips for living a healthy life: Watch your weight, exercise, eat nutritious food and don’t smoke, for example. What if you could combine these lifestyle factors with a host of other variables to learn your risk of developing specific diseases, to help catch and treat them early or prevent them altogether? <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ortega-victor-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20520652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, associate director for the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a> in Arizona, explains how science is drawing ever closer to making such personal health forecasts possible.</p>



<p>Previously inconceivable, such personal guides to well-being are becoming increasingly possible because of new and sophisticated genome-wide technologies that capture data spanning entire genomes, Dr. Ortega says. The complex scores are compiled from a combination of data from thousands to hundreds of thousands of a person's DNA sequence variants. This type of large genome-wide data has the potential to predict disease risks, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma</a> and specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20044092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancers</a>.</p>



<p>"Imagine knowing your genetic predisposition for having a heart attack in your 50s, or if you're in the top 5% of the population for the risk of cancer or diabetes based on data from your whole genome. With this knowledge, you could make informed lifestyle choices and receive enhanced screenings to mitigate that risk," Dr. Ortega says. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As a pulmonologist and genomic scientist, Dr. Ortega is leading a charge to breathe new life into precision medicine advancements. His mission is rooted in a deep commitment to health equities and inspired by his grandmother.&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="200" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061-300x200.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397911" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Victor_Ortega_WF2149252_0061.jpg 800w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Victor Ortega, M.D., Ph.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"My grandmother died of asthma, and that should not have happened. She was Puerto Rican like me, and Puerto Ricans have the highest severity and frequency of asthma of any ethnic group in the world," Dr. Ortega says. "They also represent less than 1% of people in genetic studies. So, I've made it a life mission to develop cures and diagnostics for people like my grandma, and for all people."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Each person has millions of genetic variants, each having a small effect. But together, these variants can increase the risk of getting a condition. A <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/emerge-genome-informed-risk-assessment/risk-assessment/polygenic-risk-scores" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polygenic risk score</a> estimates the overall risk someone has of getting a disease by adding up the small effects of variants throughout an individual’s entire genome.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Polygenic risk scores are not used to diagnose diseases. Some people who don't have a high-risk score for a certain disease still can be at risk of getting the disease or might already have it. Other people with high-risk scores may never get the disease.</p>



<p>People with the same genetic risk can have different outcomes depending on other factors such as lifestyle which determine one’s lifelong environmental exposures, also called the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tomorrows-cure-how-a-lifetime-of-exposures-impact-health-exposome-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exposome</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Ortega says that getting to the point where all people know their polygenic risk scores will require a solid foundation of "omics" research and datasets, cutting-edge technologies and further discoveries of gene-disease links — all of which are within his team's expertise and capabilities.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/research/pillars-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omics</a> is an emerging multidisciplinary field of biological sciences that encompasses genomics, proteomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and more.</p>



<p>"It's going to take considerable work and planning, but it really is the way of the future," he says.</p>



<p>In the shorter term, Dr. Ortega plans to transition more omics discoveries from research laboratories to the clinic. Omics data can help identify the molecular culprits driving a person's disease, as well as biomarkers that can lead to the development of targeted treatments and diagnostics.</p>



<p>Recent omics discoveries at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine have enabled scientists to predict <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-study-lays-foundation-to-predict-antidepressant-response-in-people-with-suicide-attempts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antidepressant response</a> in people with depression and discover a potential <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-mayo-clinic-algorithm-shows-potential-in-individualizing-treatment-for-depression/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">therapeutic strategy</a> for bone marrow cancer. Scientists have also used omics to pinpoint <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-pinpoint-genetic-variations-that-might-sway-course-of-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic variations</a> that potentially increase the risk for severe COVID-19, uncover <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-provides-critical-information-about-the-size-and-growth-speed-of-gliomas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential clues</a> for preventing and treating gliomas and unravel the genetic mystery of a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/scientists-unravel-genetic-mystery-of-rare-neurodevelopmental-disorder-provide-definitive-diagnoses-to-21-families-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rare neurodevelopmental disorder</a>.</p>



<p>Drawing from his years of extensive clinical experience in treating patients with severe respiratory illnesses, Dr. Ortega is also working to expand genomic testing to a broader set of diseases. He highlights the center's collaborative Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases as an effective model that he hopes to amplify.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advancing-rare-disease-breakthroughs-with-genomics-ai-and-innovation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases</a> proactively engages healthcare teams across Mayo's clinical practice to conduct&amp;nbsp;targeted genomic testing for patients with a suspected rare genetic disease. He says expanding this strategy to more diseases will help build collaborations across Mayo and educate more clinicians on genomics. It may also ensure the most effective genomic sequencing tests are given to patients, ultimately improving patient care and outcomes.</p>



<p>Dr. Ortega is leading the development of a polygenic risk score framework for Mayo Clinic, beginning with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interstitial lung disease</a>. This condition, marked by progressive scarring of lung tissue, is influenced by both rare gene variants and a collection of more common variants, all of which are captured together in polygenic risk scores.</p>

<p>"The data show that gains in longevity are not matched with equivalent advances in healthy longevity. Growing older often means more years of life burdened with disease," says Dr. Terzic, senior author. "This research has important practice and policy implications by bringing attention to a growing threat to the quality of longevity and the need to close the healthspan-lifespan gap."</p>



<p>Dr. Terzic is the Marriott Family Director, Comprehensive Cardiac Regenerative Medicine for the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a> and Marriott Family Professor of Cardiovascular Research at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Lifespan-healthspan gap largest in the U.S.</h2>



<p>Life expectancy, or lifespan, increased from 79.2 to 80.7 years in women and from 74.1 to 76.3 years in men between 2000 and 2019, according to WHO estimates. Healthspan describes the number of years a person has lived a healthy, active, disease-free life. However, the number of years those people were living in good health did not correspondingly increase. The average global gap in lifespan versus healthspan was 9.6 years in 2019, the last year of available statistics. That represents a 13% increase since 2000.</p>



<p>The U.S. recorded the world's highest average lifespan-health span divide, with Americans living 12.4 years on average with disability and sickness. This increase from 10.9 years in 2000 comes as the U.S. also reported the highest burden of chronic disease. Mental health, substance use disorders and musculoskeletal conditions were the key contributors to illness nationally.</p>

<p>In addition, the study found a 25% gender disparity worldwide. Across 183 surveyed countries, women experienced a 2.4-year larger gap in lifespan versus healthspan than men. Neurological, musculoskeletal, urinary and genital tract disorders contributed to extended years of poor health among women.</p>

<p>"The widening healthspan-lifespan gap globally points to the need for an accelerated pivot to proactive wellness-centric care systems," says Armin Garmany, first author and an M.D./Ph.D. student in Mayo Clinic <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alix School of Medicine</a> and Mayo Clinic <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>. "Identifying contributors to the gap unique to each geography can help inform healthcare interventions specific to each country and region."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Healthspan research</h2>



<p>The Mayo Clinic research team studied statistics from the <a href="https://www.who.int/data/gho" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WHO Global Health Observatory</a>. This cross-sectional study provided data on life expectancy, health-adjusted life expectancy, years lived with disease and years of life lost among member states. The healthspan-lifespan gap for each member state was calculated by subtracting health-adjusted life expectancy from life expectancy.</p>



<p>The research team recommends additional exploration of demographic, health and economic characteristics to better define the disease patterns that are shaping the lifespan-healthspan disparities.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new treatment is showing promise for people with high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM). This precancerous condition can progress to active <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a>, a type of blood cancer. High-risk SMM carries a higher likelihood of progression.</p>



<p>Results from a phase 3 clinical trial, published in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2409029" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine</a> and presented at this week's <a href="https://www.hematology.org/meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Society of Hematology meeting</a>, demonstrated that daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets CD38, a protein found on the surface of myeloma cells, significantly reduces the risk of progression to active multiple myeloma and improves overall survival compared to active monitoring.</p>



<p>Smoldering multiple myeloma is a condition in which abnormal plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow but do not display symptoms of active multiple myeloma. High-risk SMM, however, carries a significant risk of progressing to active disease. Until now, there has been no approved treatment for this high-risk group.</p>



<p>The multicenter, international AQUILA study randomly assigned 390 patients with high-risk SMM to receive either daratumumab or active monitoring. After a median follow-up of 65.2 months, the study demonstrated a 51% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death for those receiving daratumumab. At five years, 63.1% of patients in the daratumumab group remained progression-free, compared to 40.8% in the active monitoring group. Survival at five years was also significantly higher in the daratumumab group (93% vs. 86.9%).</p>



<p>"These results are a major advancement in the treatment of high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">S. Vincent Rajkumar, M.D.</a>, hematologist, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and lead investigator of the trial. "For the first time, we have a treatment option that can significantly delay or prevent the progression to active disease, improving the lives of patients and offering them a chance at a longer, healthier future."</p>



<p>While hypertension was the most common side effect, occurring in a small percentage of patients in both groups, no new safety concerns were identified with daratumumab.</p>



<p>"This study provides strong evidence for the use of daratumumab as a treatment for high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma," says Dr. Rajkumar, the Edward W. and Betty Knight Scripps Professor of Medicine in honor of Edward C. Rosenow III, M.D.</p>



<p>Patients should discuss this new treatment option with their healthcare team to determine if it is appropriate for their individual circumstances.</p>

<p>The bloodstream is teeming with plasma proteins that can increase and decrease depending on what is happening in the body. As a result, these proteins can serve as valuable biomarkers for health.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have found that a specific plasma protein, called IL-23R, increases with age. The finding reveals a connection between a cellular aging process, called senescence, and specific plasma proteins in the blood that increase with age and decrease in response to therapeutics targeting senescent cells. This new discovery is published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-024-00752-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Aging</a>.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="600" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0061.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396505" style="width:275px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0061.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0061-300x225.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0061-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Marissa Schafer, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Our research is the first to show that IL-23R is an aging biomarker linked to senescence. Since IL-23R influences many inflammatory conditions that can increase with age, our discovery opens new lines of investigation as to how circulating IL-23R may influence disease processes with age," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/schafer-marissa-j-ph-d/bio-20515520" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marissa Schafer, Ph.D.</a></p>



<p>IL-23R is known to alert immune cells to help fight infections through inflammation, the body's defense mechanism. However, when IL-23R is overactive, it can lead to tissue damage and drive the persistent inflammation that underlies conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p>



<p>The research team measured IL-23R levels in donated blood samples of 40 men and 40 women ranging in age from 20 to 90 years old. They found that IL-23R increased in blood circulation with age among the participants. Using a preclinical model, they showed that IL-23R is linked to markers of senescence in aged organs, particularly the kidneys.</p>



<p>Additionally, the researchers tested five different senotherapeutics, drugs specially designed to eliminate senescent cells. All of these drugs targeted genes or proteins that are highly expressed in senescent cells. They found the senotherapeutics reduced the amount of plasma proteins including IL-23R.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0039.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396506" style="width:187px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0039.jpg 600w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/WF3294958_0039-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Chase Carver, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"By targeting and&amp;nbsp;reducing senescent cells, we can influence the systemic landscape by decreasing inflammatory mediators that are secreted in tissues and into circulation, such as IL-23R. This suggests that IL-23R is an important aging biomarker in senescence, inflammation and organ 'cross talk' that may be useful in clinical research and practice," explains lead author Chase Carver, Ph.D.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps and implications</h2>



<p>The researchers are continuing to study how circulating IL-23R is produced, how it affects inflammatory signaling throughout the body and how it drives disease states.</p>



<p>They are also collaborating with others to assess if other senotherapeutic approaches or exercise reduce circulating IL-23R levels in humans.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> researcher will share findings from a late-breaking abstract at the <a href="https://suonet.org/meetings/upcoming-meetings.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 Society of Urologic Oncology Annual Meeting</a> in Dallas, Dec. 4-6.</p>



<p>The study demonstrated a potentially effective treatment for patients with bladder cancer who no longer respond to the common therapy, <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/05/22/bladder-cancer-research-is-driving-new-treatment-options-better-outcomes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG)</a>. The novel treatment, cretostimogene grenadenorepvec, is an oncolytic immunotherapy, meaning it is a virus designed to selectively replicate in and break down cancer cells while simultaneously amplifying the immune response against bladder tumors.</p>



<p>Efficacy data from 110 participants in the study showed that nearly 75% experienced complete cancer remission, with many remaining cancer-free beyond two years. Remarkably, most participants did not require bladder removal surgery, and the treatment was well tolerated with minimal serious side effects. Ongoing research will look to determine the long-term efficacy and whether combining this therapy with other treatments will enhance its effectiveness. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"These findings address a significant unmet need for bladder cancer patients and could improve their quality of life," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tyson-mark-d-ii-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20524031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Tyson, M.D.</a>, urologic oncologist and lead investigator of the study. "We now know this treatment can be both effective and safe, potentially reducing the need for bladder removal surgery and providing a much-needed alternative for patients with limited options."</p>



<p>The <a href="https://suo-abstracts.secure-platform.com/a/gallery/rounds/21/details/3706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abstract</a>, "Topline Results: BOND-003 cohort C- A phase 3, single-arm study of intravesical cretostimogene grenadenorepvec for high-risk BCG-unresponsive non-muscle invasive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer</a> with carcinoma in situ," will be presented by Dr. Tyson on Thursday, Dec. 5, 11:45–11:50 a.m. CST.</p>

<p>There's a lot of brain power that goes into speech. First, there's a thought or idea, which the brain must translate into words. Those words are then translated into specific movements of the lungs, tongue and mouth to shape the sounds. Those movements then must be perfectly executed and timed with breath. If there's any damage to the brain from a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aphasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20369518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>&amp;nbsp;or if there's presence of a brain disease, the time of the movements or translation can go wrong. Because of that, changes in voice and speech can provide the first clues to a neurodegenerative disease.</p>



<p>In this Mayo Clinic Minute,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/botha-hugo-m-b-ch-b/bio-20518791" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Hugo Botha</a>, a Mayo Clinic behavioral neurologist, explains how voice samples collected for research can help diagnose neurodegenerative diseases early.</p>

<p>"There are some diseases where the very first manifestation is in someone's voice or their speech," says Dr. Botha. Those include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/parkinsons-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20376055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parkinson’s disease</a>; atypical parkinsonism such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-system-atrophy/symptoms-causes/syc-20356153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple system atrophy</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progressive-supranuclear-palsy/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20355668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive supranuclear palsy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/corticobasal-degeneration/symptoms-causes/syc-20354767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corticobasal syndrome</a>; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</a> (ALS); <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myasthenia-gravis/symptoms-causes/syc-20352036" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myasthenia gravis</a>; and some types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frontotemporal dementia </a>that can result in <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/a-mayo-clinic-expert-explains-aphasia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aphasia</a>.</p>



<p>As part of clinical practice, Mayo Clinic's neurology patients often are recorded when they have their voice or speech examined, which gives clinicians the opportunity to track the disease over time.</p>



<p>"But separate from the clinical practice, we have a large research program at Mayo, where we are collecting voice and speech samples using an application that runs on the person's phone or the laptop computer," Dr. Botha explains.</p>



<p>To collect the voice samples, patients are tasked with running through a series of exams remotely.</p>



<p>"They could do it — say every couple of weeks, every couple of months — so we can really get a longitudinal view of their disease instead of just a snapshot," says Dr. Botha.</p>



<p>The creation of this large and growing speech bank, which securely stores all speech and voice samples, can be used for research, including using it to train artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"There are some signals in someone's voice and speech that a computer or an algorithm might pick up on, that a human listener wouldn't pick up on. And so that's more of the sort of research, AI side of things, where we're trying to use hundreds of recordings and patients with various diseases, and then trying to see if the computer can separate those diseases, even though human listeners may not be able to," says Dr. Botha.</p>

<p>Aging can be a balancing act, and according to Mayo Clinic research, your ability to balance on one leg can be a meaningful measure of aging.</p>



<p>"This was a study looking at markers of aging in older adults," explains Dr. Kaufman, senior author of the study and director of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/motion-analysis/overview?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motion Analysis Laboratory</a>&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Forty healthy, independent, community-dwelling people over age 50 underwent various tasks known to be markers of aging, including balance.</p>



<p>"We were comparing different markers of aging and trying to see which one was the most predictive of declines with aging," says Dr. Kaufman.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Standing on one leg</h2>



<p>He says, if someone can stand with all their weight on one leg for 30 seconds, they're doing very well.</p>

<p>"Balance is complicated. It involves many different systems. It involves your vision, your vestibular system, your somatosensory system and your neuromuscular system. All those have to work in coordinated fashion to keep you on one leg," says Dr. Kaufman.</p>



<p>All of those systems deteriorate with age and increase the risk of falls. The good news is it's never too late to improve your balance, it just takes practice.</p>



<p>"The important message is to try it at home. It's very simple, easy to do. It's quick. If you are unable to stand on your leg for five seconds, at least five seconds, then you're at risk of falling," says Dr. Kaufman.</p>
