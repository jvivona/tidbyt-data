<p>New research from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> suggests that artificial intelligence (AI) could improve the diagnosis of peripartum <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">cardiomyopathy</a>, a potentially life-threatening and treatable condition that weakens the heart muscle of women during pregnancy or in the months after giving birth. Researchers used an AI-enabled digital stethoscope that captures <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983">electrocardiogram</a> (ECG) data and heart sounds to identify twice as many cases of peripartum cardiomyopathy as compared to regular care,<a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/ai-technology-improved-detection-of-heart-disease-during-and-after-pregnancy"> according to a news</a> release from the American Heart Association.</p>



<p>Identifying a weak heart pump caused by pregnancy is important because the symptoms, such as shortness of breath when lying down, swelling of hands and feet, weight gain, and rapid heartbeat, can be confused with normal symptoms of pregnancy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20502753">Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, shared research insights during a late-breaking science presentation at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2023.</p>



<p>Women in Nigeria have the highest reported incidence of peripartum cardiomyopathy. The randomized pragmatic clinical trial enrolled 1,195 women receiving pregnancy care in Nigeria. Approximately half were evaluated with AI-guided screening using the digital stethoscope, and half received usual obstetric care in addition to a clinical ECG. An <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856">echocardiogram</a> was used to confirm when the AI-enabled digital stethoscope predicted peripartum cardiomyopathy. Overall, 4% of the pregnant and postpartum women in the intervention arm of the clinical trial had cardiomyopathy compared to 2% in the control arm, suggesting that half are likely undetected with usual care.</p>

<p>During clinical rotations in medical school, Kianna Nguyen encountered many patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver failure</a>&nbsp;and was struck by a grim reality: Their only hope was a transplant. The shortage of donor organs and therapeutic options was at once frustrating and inspirational, triggering her research interest in cellular therapies for liver failure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nguyen-Kianna-M._21458961_201906170422.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376863" style="aspect-ratio:0.83375;width:197px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nguyen-Kianna-M._21458961_201906170422.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Nguyen-Kianna-M._21458961_201906170422-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kianna Nguyen<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Research provides us with the understanding to develop tools to make big changes in clinical problems like those facing patients with liver failure," says Nguyen. "I want to be on the forefront of developing medical technologies that provide alternatives. I derive a lot of passion for research through thinking about the future patients I will be treating in the clinic."</p>



<p>Nguyen is a fifth-year M.D.-Ph.D. student in the&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>, who is also completing her Ph.D. in regenerative sciences through the&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/">Mayo Clinic Graduate School o</a><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">f</a><a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/">&nbsp;Biomedical Sciences</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Her research is focused on redirecting human embryonic stem cells to become liver cells with the potential for cell, tissue and organ repair. This research is aimed at providing an alternative to a liver transplant.</p>



<p>Supervising her research is mentor&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/revzin-alexander-ph-d/bio-20359633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexander Revzin, Ph.D.</a>, who leads Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cellular-microsystems-biosensors/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cellular Microsystems and Biosensors Laboratory</a>. Dr Revzin is a biomedical engineer and scientist whose lab has developed a technique to encapsulate stem cells and reprogram them to become different cell types with therapeutic potential. The stem cells reside in a microcapsule — &nbsp;a microscopic plastic container filled with an aqueous solution. The microcapsule protects the cells from physical damage during bioprocessing and may be used to deliver signals that direct stem cells toward a desired tissue such as pancreas or liver tissue. The goal of the project is to use microcapsules to make liver tissue in sufficient quantities for use in humans. The hope is to one day transplant these cells as a treatment for complex diseases such as liver failure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Revzin-Alexander-PhD_20130571_201610040336.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376864" style="aspect-ratio:0.83375;width:251px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Revzin-Alexander-PhD_20130571_201610040336.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/11/Revzin-Alexander-PhD_20130571_201610040336-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Alexander Revzin, Ph.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Encapsulation is an exciting new way to allow for scalable manufacturing of cellular therapies while decreasing the cost," says Dr. Revzin. “Kianna Nguyen has a unique skill set to work on this project. She is trained as a chemical engineer and biomaterials scientist and is well-positioned to develop encapsulation strategies. She is passionate about improving outcomes for patients with end-stage liver disease."</p>



<p>"The additional advantage of growing liver cells inside of capsules is they are provided with a protective shell so that they are not destroyed by the immune system when they are transplanted into the body," adds Nguyen. "Ultimately, the goal of this project is to be able to redirect liver cells on a large scale."</p>



<p>Regenerative sciences is an emerging field aimed at delivering new medicines from biological sources such as blood and cells to address conditions with few therapeutic options. The goal is to cure disease rather than treat symptoms. Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>&nbsp;is leading efforts to develop groundbreaking curricula to train physicians and scientists for this potentially transformative medical care. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>A disease with complications</strong></p>



<p>More than 100 million people in the U.S. have some form of liver disease, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://liverfoundation.org/about-your-liver/facts-about-liver-disease/how-many-people-have-liver-disease/#:~:text=More%20than%20100%20million%20people,been%20diagnosed%20with%20liver%20disease." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Liver Foundation</a>.&nbsp;While the liver has a remarkable ability to regenerate, chronic conditions such as cirrhosis, hepatitis and fatty liver disease can quickly progress to end-stage disease. Without a transplant, many patients will die.</p>



<p>Some people with cancer or alcohol use disorder are not suitable for transplantation. Those who are transplant candidates face complications including rejection, infection and risk of cancer.</p>



<p>"Stem cell-derived liver cells could provide a renewable source of liver cells to serve as a treatment for patients with liver failure. This could open the door to treatment for many liver patients who previously did not have any options," says Nguyen.</p>



<p>A native of Colorado, Nguyen was attracted to Mayo by the opportunity to train in clinical and laboratory settings with some of the most accomplished clinicians and researchers in the world.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic has so many exemplary physician-scientists. There is no shortage of mentors because faculty here are all so happy to share their expertise with you," she says. "I have been able to grow so much as both a budding clinician and scientist. I am thankful to continue my education here."</p>



<p>Nguyen aspires to specialize her practice and research in gastroenterology with a focus on hepatology (liver) transplantation. She is on a path to graduate with her M.D. and Ph.D. in 2027.</p>

<p>High-grade gliomas are cancerous tumors that spread quickly in the brain or spinal cord. In a new study led by Mayo Clinic, researchers found invasive brain tumor margins of high-grade <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20350251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioma</a> (HGG) contain biologically distinct genetic and molecular alterations that point to aggressive behavior and disease recurrence. The findings suggest insights into potential treatments that could modify the course of the disease.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-41559-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Nature Communications, profiled 313 tumor biopsies from 68 HGG patients using genomics (study of genes), transcriptomics (study of gene expression at the mRNA level) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</p>



<p>Glioma is a growth of cells that starts in the brain or spinal cord. The invasive margins of HGG have long remained a mystery due to the difficulties in surgical biopsy of these regions. The aggressive nature of most gliomas, and the visual and textural similarities between the affected regions and normal tissue, create a challenge for neurosurgeons during removal of the tumor. Some glioma cells may get left behind.</p>



<p>The cells in a glioma look like healthy brain cells called glial cells. As a glioma grows, it forms a mass of cells called a tumor. The tumor can grow to press on brain or spinal cord tissue, causing a range of symptoms. There are many types of glioma. Some grow slowly and aren't considered to be cancers. Others are considered cancerous. Malignant gliomas grow quickly and can invade healthy brain tissue.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — New research from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> finds that patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphedema/symptoms-causes/syc-20374682?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphedema</a> —swelling of the limbs caused by the accumulation of protein-rich fluids of the immune system — had twice the risk of developing skin cancer than patients without lymphedema.</p>



<p>Patients with lymphedema had a significantly higher frequency of developing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/basal-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20354187?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basal cell carcinomas</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">squamous cell carcinomas</a> on the lower extremities, according to the retrospective study published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(23)00117-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>. The study contributes to growing information linking lymphedema to localized changes in immunity and a predisposition for cancer.</p>



<p>The study reviewed data from 4,437 patients who were diagnosed with lower extremity lymphedema at Mayo Clinic in Rochester from 2000 to 2020. Compared with a matched control group, the group with lymphedema had an increased risk of skin cancer, and for patients who had lymphedema in one leg, that extremity was nearly three times as likely to have skin cancer compared with the other leg.</p>



<p>Lymphedema can be caused by surgery or cancer treatments that remove or damage the lymph nodes, which carry fluids of the immune system. Less commonly, lymphedema can be caused by inherited conditions.</p>

<p>"Patients with lymphedema are not screened routinely by dermatologists, and inadequate screening may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/alavi-afsaneh-m-d/bio-20492616?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Afsaneh Alavi, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic dermatologist and the study's senior author. "Our findings suggest the need for a relatively high degree of suspicion of skin cancer at sites with lymphedema. There is a need for raising awareness in clinicians seeing patients with lymphedema, and these patients may need regular skin cancer screenings, since early detection of skin cancer is critical."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified new scoring criteria allowing for the detection of treatable forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) with reasonably high confidence during a patient's first clinical visit. This scoring criteria may allow physicians to substantially reduce the time it takes to begin treatment. The findings are published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Neurology</a>.</p>



<p>Rapidly progressive dementia is caused by several disorders that quickly impair intellectual functioning and interfere with normal activities and relationships. If patients' symptoms appear suddenly and they decline quickly, a physician may make the diagnosis of RPD. These patients can progress from initial symptoms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a>&nbsp;to complete incapacitation, requiring full-time care, in less than two years.</p>



<p>The study analyzed data from 155 patients with RPD who were diagnosed at Mayo Clinic in Florida and Washington University in St. Louis. The median age of patients at the time of symptom onset was 69 years old. Patients underwent a standard evaluation, including brain&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electroencephalogram</a>, blood tests and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumbar-puncture/about/pac-20394631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spinal tap</a>. They then were followed for up to two years. The study team reviewed the data, assigned clinical diagnoses and determined which diseases would be considered potentially treatment-responsive. The team then compared symptoms and test results between patients with treatment-responsive and non-treatment-responsive causes. This identified key factors that were present at the time of the patient's first visit and were associated with treatment-responsive causes of RPD.</p>



<p>Seizures, tumors, MRI features of autoimmune encephalitis, movement abnormalities and other conditions were each associated with treatment-responsive causes of RPD in the study. Ninety-five percent of patients with these conditions were captured through a screening score developed by the Mayo researchers. The score was calculated by assigning points for clinical findings present during a patient's first visit for evaluation of cognitive decline.</p>

<p>"Many conditions that cause rapidly progressive dementia can be treated and even reversed. We found that more than half of the patients in our study with rapidly progressive dementia had a treatable underlying condition. We may be able to identify many of these patients early in the symptomatic course by intentionally searching for key clinical symptoms and exam findings and integrating these with results of a brain MRI and spinal tap," says the study's senior author,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregory-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Day, M.D.</a>, a clinical researcher, neurologist and vice chair of research of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Neurology</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>.</p>

<p>"It's crucial to treat patients sooner by identifying a condition that is causing their rapidly progressive dementia," says Nihal Satyadev, M.D., a neurology resident at Mayo Clinic in Florida and the study's first author. "It's equally important to recognize patients who are less likely to benefit from treatment, as this can allow the focus of care to shift to supporting quality of life and appropriate counseling."</p>



<p>The study authors plan to continue research to improve diagnosis and treatment of patients with RPD, and to make it easier for clinicians to apply their tool to recognize patients with RPD. The team has already completed a project considering spinal fluid biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and early recognition of treatable patients.

<p>Sisters often share certain genetic traits, such as hair color and facial features. But for three sisters from Minnesota, they discovered a much deeper connection — a shared genetic mutation known to dramatically increase their risk for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>.</p>



<p>Their BRCA1 variants came to light through a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine</a> DNA sequencing study. The study highlights the importance of genetic screening and the potential for hereditary health concerns. The diagnoses have prompted each of the sisters to take preventative actions for themselves, and their families. </p>



<p>"Having this knowledge is lifesaving and life changing," says Chris Swatfager, the middle sister from Minnesota who was the first to undergo the DNA testing and receive the difficult diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>BRCA1 is an inherited condition that significantly increases the likelihood of developing breast and ovarian cancer during a person's lifetime. According to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/brca-fact-sheet#:~:text=Breast%20cancer%3A%20About%2013%25%20of,age%20(2%E2%80%934)." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institutes of Health</a>, the breast cancer risk is 55%-72%, compared to approximately 13% for the general population. The risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 30%-60%, compared to approximately 1% for the general population. A parent with a BRCA1 mutation has a 50% chance of passing it down to their child. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Genetic screening reveals hidden health risks</h3>



<p>Given Chris's medical history of breast lumps, and her sister Carrie's breast cancer battle 16 years earlier, she says a clear picture suddenly came into focus. However, her original motivation to participate in the DNA sequencing study was driven by the heartbreaking death of her youngest sister, Amy, who had a heart attack in 2020. It marked the second heart attack-related death in the family. Chris believed there must be a hereditary link to heart disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chris had learned that the Mayo Clinic study was screening for three actionable hereditary conditions, including a high cholesterol disorder called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familial hypercholesterolemia</a>, which raises the risk for a heart attack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other conditions in the study were related to BRCA1, as well as BRCA2, which is associated with breast, ovarian, pancreatic, and prostate cancers. Additionally,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank">Lynch Syndrome</a>&nbsp;was being assessed, which raises the risk of colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>Though none of these other conditions had crossed her mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To her surprise, Chris's results ruled out a genetic susceptibility to familial hypercholesterolemia, revealing instead a BRCA1 mutation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After undergoing comprehensive genetic counseling and receiving guidance from her physician, Chris opted for a double mastectomy and hysterectomy to mitigate her cancer risks. She also shared her diagnosis with her sisters, who, in turn, pursued genetic testing and received their own BRCA1 diagnoses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Carrie Patnode, who had already battled breast cancer at the age of 48, the diagnosis has brought assurance that she can stay ahead of any new cancer developments with increased screenings and scans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I think I may have done things differently if the BRCA test would have been provided when I was first diagnosed with breast cancer," Carrie says. "Now, after everything I've been through, I figure I'm going in every six months and getting mammograms every year and doing MRIs every year, and I'm confident they're going to find anything that reappears."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cindy Larson, the oldest among the sisters and a retired letter carrier, developed bladder cancer shortly after receiving her genetic test results. She has chosen to hold off on any preventative procedures related to her BRCA1 variant, guided by the advice of her Mayo Clinic physician,<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pruthi-sandhya-m-d/bio-00083681">&nbsp;Sandhya Pruthi, M.D.</a></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">A new frontier in predicting disease risk</h3>



<p>Dr. Pruthi specializes in breast cancer prevention, and she’s working to pinpoint Cindy's genetic risk estimation related to her breast and ovarian cancer syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Pruthi says new and sophisticated genome sequencing technologies are opening the door to less invasive alternatives with the advancement of polygenic risk scores. The complex scores, compiled from a combination of data from thousands of a person's DNA variants, have the potential to offer precise insights into how patients should respond to a genetic mutation diagnosis associated with a cancer syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Polygenic risk scores allow us to potentially determine a patient's 5-year, 10-year and lifetime cancer risk," Dr. Pruthi says. "It may help us determine if and when a patient should undergo preventative procedures now or opt for surveillance over the next decade." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, Dr. Pruthi says the power of genetic testing lies in its ability to help identify patients at high risk for cancer, enabling earlier screening and mitigating the risk of metastatic cancer and premature deaths — something she sees all too often.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Quest to bring genetic screening into everyday healthcare</h3>



<p>Mayo Clinic is advancing the idea of bringing genetic screening to routine patient care.</p>



<p>“We’re also studying the health utilization needs of those patients affected. This knowledge will transform the delivery of care in the coming decade,” says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights">Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</a>, the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis says the immense impact of population-scale genetic screening reaches far beyond the benefits to individual people. It is also about the biological family members of those affected.</p>



<p>“It provides a collective wisdom that can shape public health strategies, increase disease prevention, and advance individualized medicine. It empowers people to be proactive about their own healthcare and prevention.” Dr. Lazaridis says.</p>



<p>For Chris, Carrie and Cindy, equally important to their own diagnoses is sharing the hereditary condition with their children and other blood relatives so they too can receive early disease detection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This affects generations of families and I hope genetic testing will soon become available for everyone," Chris says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no cure for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progressive-supranuclear-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20355659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive supranuclear palsy</a>&nbsp;(PSP), a brain disorder marked by walking and balance difficulties. Its symptoms also mimic Parkinson's disease and dementia. The condition leads to rapid, progressive decline and death. In a new paper published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42626-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>, Mayo researchers and collaborators outline new therapeutic targets that may lead to potential future treatments for PSP, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>&nbsp;and related disorders.</p>



<p>People with PSP usually are diagnosed in their late 60s and 70s. While the cause isn't known, researchers have found that the deteriorating brain cells of people with PSP have excess amounts of a protein called tau. Clumps of tau are also found in people with other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers zeroed in on RNA, the carrier of genetic information in all living cells. They integrated brain RNA data from two large, independent human study groups, including donor samples from patients with PSP from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-neuroscience-florida/biorepositories/mayo-clinic-brain-bank">Mayo Clinic Brain Bank</a>. They performed RNA sequencing, which allowed them to discover which genes in certain brain cells were abnormally high or low in patients with PSP. Each study group contained brain samples from people who had died from PSP, as well as a control group of brain samples from people who did not die from a neurodegenerative disorder. The researchers used samples from more than 400 people overall.</p>



<p>After performing the RNA sequencing, the researchers used a computational model to systematically identify nearly 5,000 genes involved in PSP in relevant brain cells. They then compared their findings to an analysis performed in a preclinical model that mimics the brain pathology seen in PSP. In the end, the researchers "ranked," or prioritized, 11 high-confidence genes that are unusually elevated in human PSP brains and this model.</p>



<p>Finally, the investigators manipulated these target genes in an experimental fruit fly model. They wanted to determine whether reducing the levels of these abnormally elevated genes could correct the degeneration in the model. Among the 11 high-confidence genes, researchers found that reducing the levels of <em>DDR2</em>, <em>KANK2</em> and <em>STOM</em> showed the most promise in reversing disease and as leading targets for therapeutic development.</p>

<p>"This research enhances our understanding of progressive supranuclear palsy and other related incurable neurological disorders," says the study's senior author,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ertekin-taner-nilufer-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nilüfer&nbsp;Ertekin-Taner, M.D., Ph.D.,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic neurologist, neuroscientist and chair of the Department of Neuroscience. "Moving forward, we can target these specific genes or others that are biologically related to them to develop a potential treatment for this untreatable disease."</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/genetics-of-alzheimers-disease-and-endophenotypes/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team</a>&nbsp;also built a&nbsp;<a href="https://rtools.mayo.edu/PSP_RNAseq_Atlas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">web application</a>&nbsp;to enable data-sharing among the wider research community.</p>



<p>"This project highlights the power of multiomics data," says Yuhao (Harry) Min, a&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>&nbsp;predoctoral student in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/education/phd-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical and Translational Science</a>&nbsp;track and first author of the paper. "Using these datasets, we were able to tease apart the complex molecular changes that took place in patients with PSP, which is important to understand to find a cure for this disorder. We also shared our datasets with the scientific community to enable collaborative efforts, with the goal of finding a treatment for patients. Because PSP shares similar biology as other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, we hope our findings might also benefit drug discovery efforts in other neurological disorders."</p>



<p>The next steps in this research are to work on the synthesis of small nucleic acid molecules that can regulate the target genes identified in this study. The researchers hope to assess the safety and efficacy of those molecules in cell and animal models, with the long-term goal of beginning clinical trials in PSP patients.</p>

<p>Risk can be a complicated and confounding concept, particularly when it comes to life-or-death situations like cancer. The discovery of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in the 1990s enabled many women to learn they are at high risk of developing breast cancer. More than a dozen other <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> genes have been identified since, but the risks associated with them have been far less certain. Research from Mayo Clinic has filled critical gaps in the understanding of how these genes predispose women to disease, in ways that directly influence patient care.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Siddartha-Yadav-200x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376410" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Siddhartha Yadav, M.D.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This is truly bench to bedside research," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yadav-siddhartha-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20489847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddhartha Yadav, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist and breast cancer researcher. "Just finding out you have one of these genetic alterations is not good enough — we need to know the risk so we can mitigate that risk."</p>



<p>Dr. Yadav has been working with cancer geneticist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, for the last six years to define the risks that come with inheriting various genetic variants. In 2021, they and nearly 60 other researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published a seminal study</a>&nbsp;in the New England Journal of Medicine that provided more accurate risk estimates for 28 different breast cancer genes.</p>



<p>"We’ve known about these genes for quite some time," says Dr. Couch. "But nobody ever had enough information or enough data to really say anything about the risks associated with them."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Aggregating Data to Estimate Risk</strong>s</h2>



<p>In 2016, Dr. Couch and his colleagues built a large, population-based study drawing from 17 established epidemiology studies such as the Harvard Nurses’ Health Study and the American Cancer Society’s Cancer Prevention Studies. The result was the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) consortium, which amassed a collection of samples from approximately 35, 000 women with breast cancer and another 35,000 women without breast cancer.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/1299536_3506340_0027-200x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376409" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Fergus Couch, Ph.D., is the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professor of Medical Research.<br></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Analyzing these samples revealed that the risks associated with mutations for women in the general population were lower than previous estimates, which had been based on high-risk populations with a personal or family history of breast cancer. The analysis, published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33471974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seminal NEJM study</a>, indicated that 16 of the 28 genes previously thought to play a role in breast cancer did not increase a woman’s risk of disease.</p>



<p>"There was a lot of false information out there about what genes may or may not increase risk," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, breast cancer oncologist and director of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/cancer-research/research-programs/womens-cancer-program/breast-cancer-spore/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic’s Breast Cancer&nbsp;SPORE</a>, which has funded research in this area since its creation in 2005. The&nbsp;<a href="https://trp.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SPORE</a>, or Specialized Program of Research Excellence, is a cornerstone of the&nbsp;National Cancer Institute's efforts to promote collaborative, interdisciplinary translational cancer research.</p>



<p>"Dr. Couch’s work brought clarity, and led to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) taking at least one gene off their list of genes to test for," says Dr. Goetz.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/1173095_3367870_0012-200x300-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-376408" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Updating Guidelines, Understanding Outcome</strong>s</h2>



<p>The NCCN is one of several organizations, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Society of Breast Surgeons, that have set guidelines for screening for inherited breast cancer gene changes, known as germline genetic testing. "Deciding who needs testing is one of the biggest controversies in the field," says Dr. Yadav. "Some have suggested all women get tested; others have recommended testing only women of a certain age."</p>



<p>Dr. Yadav and his colleagues evaluated these criteria, applying them to a large patient registry that included nearly 4,000 women treated for breast cancer at Mayo Clinic. They found that the NCCN guidelines missed 35-50% of patients with disease-causing genetic mutations. The findings, published in 2020 in the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32125938/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a>, led NCCN and other organizations to expand their guidelines on germline genetic testing.</p>



<p>Another area where the Mayo team has made a significant impact is in linking breast cancer genes to clinical outcomes. According to Dr. Yadav, women newly diagnosed with cancer in one breast often want to know the chances that the disease will spread to the other breast or to other parts of the body. "For BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers, we knew that their risks were high," he says. "But for these other genes that cause breast cancer, what happens to those women? There were no answers to that."</p>



<p>Using data from the CARRIERS consortium, the researchers&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36623243/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determined the risks</a>&nbsp;that women carrying different germline genetic mutations had of developing cancer in both breasts, known as contralateral breast cancer. For example, they found that carriers of ATM mutations did not have a significantly elevated risk of contralateral breast cancer, whereas those with BRCA1, BRCA2 and CHEK2 mutations had double the risk. The researchers believe the findings make genetic information more actionable, as different breast cancer genes appear to create tumors that behave quite differently.</p>



<p>At the molecular level, breast cancer is typically broken down into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/in-depth/breast-cancer/art-20045654" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">four major subtypes</a>&nbsp;— triple-negative, HER2-positive, luminal A and luminal B — each with different degrees of aggressiveness and responses to treatment. Through an industry collaboration with a genetic testing company, the Mayo team analyzed testing results from nearly 55,000 breast cancer patients and found that&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32091585/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different breast cancer genes</a>&nbsp;appear to drive each of the different subtypes.</p>



<p>"Those insights into tumor biology are critically important for treatment and prevention," says Dr. Goetz. "There are some drugs, for example, that work fairly well to reduce the risk of developing luminal A breast cancer, but they don’t do anything to reduce the risk of triple-negative breast cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Examining Variants of Uncertain Significance</strong></h2>



<p>BRCA1, BRCA2 and most of the other genes associated with breast cancer are normally involved in repairing damage to DNA. When these genes are defective, DNA damage can accumulate, allowing cells to grow out of control and turn cancerous. Researchers have identified hundreds of genetic alterations that are known to cause breast cancer, but they have also uncovered thousands more that could either cause disease or be benign. These variants of uncertain significance (VUS), as they are called, are a big problem for clinicians and patients alike.</p>



<p>"There’s 30,000 women, probably more, in the United States carrying these types of variants and we don’t know what to do with them," says Dr. Couch. "We’re supposed to just ignore those results, but the psychological impact is already there. We hear stories about women getting prophylactic surgeries on the basis of VUS results just because they’re so worried about them."</p>



<p>Dr. Couch has led&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35736817/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extensive efforts</a>&nbsp;to reclassify the VUS lurking in breast cancer genes, methodically reproducing one variant after another in the lab and assessing their effect on DNA repair. "Our approach has proved invaluable in improving our understanding of these different variants, but it has been slow-going," he says. "In 15 years, we’ve done about 500 variants of BRCA2." Recently, his team ramped up its research by using high-throughput, CRISPR-based gene editing technology to generate each variant, which will enable them to create a catalog of every possible VUS and their impacts.</p>



<p>In the future, the researchers plan to continue probing the connections between genes and breast cancer, examining how cancers with different genetic mutations respond to therapy and even searching for previously undiscovered breast cancer genes.</p>



<p>"This is not just some esoteric research that stays in the lab or an academic publication," says Dr. Couch. "These findings get rapidly integrated into the clinical workflow, informing patients about the risks they face and how to manage them."</p>

<p>"We sometimes use these terms inconsistently. That confuses us as scientists, and clinicians. It confuses our patients and our families. So we decided to take a look at that whole issue and see if we could understand the problem, and then make some recommendations," says Dr. Petersen.</p>



<p>In a recently published <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaneurology/fullarticle/2810313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a> authored by Dr. Petersen, the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease authorized a committee to help bring consistency to the use of the terms.</p>



<p>What's the difference between Alzheimer's disease and dementia?</p>



<p>"Dementia is a clinical syndrome, which means that it has a set of clinical features of the disease. Alzheimer's disease, though, implies that there's an underlying biological cause of the dementia. Often we get these two terms confused," says Dr. Petersen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clearing up the confusion</h2>



<p>The initiative is organized into three groups: researchers and scientists, clinicians and public stakeholders. Focus groups, which included people from underrepresented groups, also were asked to look at the various cultural issues surrounding this language.</p>



<p>"How the term dementia is used in one group might be quite different from how it's used in another group. We put all of these inputs together and came up with a framework that we hope is going to help sort out how these terms should be used so that everybody is using them consistently."</p>



<p>Dr. Petersen says the goal is not to change any definitions of any disease, but rather to clarify how different expert groups are defining the diseases.</p>



<p>"Is it clinically? Is it biologically? Or is it a combination of clinical and biologic features? So the framework is meant to characterize those distinctions," says Dr. Petersen.</p>



<p>"We hope by clarifying how people are using these terms, we'll be better able to communicate with patients and families when we discuss a disease like Alzheimer's disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The next steps</h2>



<p>Dr. Petersen says the next step is going to be a beta test of the new framework.</p>



<p>"In the next phase of this exercise, we're going to ask clinicians, primary care physicians, and specialty clinicians to actually use this framework to see if it helps them explain the underlying diseases to the patients and to the families. We're going to ask patients and families, 'What did you understand going in? What do you understand going out?' Same thing with the clinicians themselves," says Dr. Petersen.</p>

He says Mayo Clinic also is researching how RFA may be used to treat&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Radiofrequency ablation, which many people might simply call an RFA, is a way of targeting a specific part of the thyroid, an abnormal part, by delivering high energy into that specific area of the thyroid and destroying it," says Dr. Stan.</p>



<p>He says patients with enlarged, benign thyroid nodules are good candidates for RFA.</p>



<p>"Patients will have an inch and a half to two inches thyroid nodules in diameter that we think are reaching the point where a problem is present or is likely going to be present," Dr. Stan says.</p>

<p>Along with retaining thyroid function, there are other advantages.</p>



<p>"The benefit is that we can do it in the outpatient setting, without the scar on the neck," he says.</p>



<p>Treating thyroid nodules is one application for RFA. Mayo Clinic is one of the leading U.S. institutions to research using RFA for thyroid cancer treatment.</p>



<p>"We hope that this will also be able to destroy a thyroid cancer very specifically, as opposed to a surgical approach that would eliminate part of the thyroid," says Dr. Stan.</p>
