<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.</p>



<p>The protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.</p>



<p>"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study, detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11829009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>. "This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer."</p>



<p>T cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.</p>



<p>There are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:</p>



<p>CAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.</p>



<p>NKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic <a href="http://10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/10/2/162/678013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tudy</a> had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.</p>



<p>Dr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-383780" style="width:218px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-196x300.jpg 196w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD.jpg 736w" sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells," says Dr. Billadeau. "We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression."</p>



<p>The manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9d429618f26cd0b086d8f52428b40dc4" style="color:#908e8e">(<em>Video: Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D., medical director of Mayo Clinic’s Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, analyzes genetic data on screen, uncovering insights into</em> <em>rare disease</em>.)</p>



<p>February 28 is <a href="https://www.rarediseaseday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rare Disease Day</a>, a time to recognize the millions of people worldwide living with conditions that often go undiagnosed or untreated. In the U.S., a disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 people. </p>



<p>More than 7,000 rare diseases have been identified, many of them genetic. These conditions can affect vital organs, the nervous system, the immune system and other critical functions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, researchers and clinicians are advancing precision medicine to improve diagnoses and develop treatments once thought impossible. A key part of this effort is the center's <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org//discussion/mayos-new-omics-strategy-leaps-into-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rare Disease Omics strategy</a>. This innovative approach moves discovery from the lab to patient care.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining multiple layers of biological omics data, including genomics (study of genes), proteomics (study of proteins), and other molecular insights, scientists uncover how rare diseases form at their earliest stages and progress over time. Using omics tools, they identify mutations, examine disruptions in cellular function and trace how small errors in biological processes can lead to disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our goal is to build a discovery pipeline," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/curry-timothy-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothy Curry, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, the William O. Lund, Jr. and Natalie C. Lund Program Director for Clinomics, and the associate director of Practice Implementation at the Center for Individualized Medicine. Dr. Curry leads the center's Rare Disease Omics pillar.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Every breakthrough we make brings us closer to the day when rare diseases once thought untreatable can be managed or even cured," he says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial Intelligence helps accelerate research</strong></h2>



<p>Artificial intelligence helps researchers identify genetic mutations and patterns that are difficult to detect through traditional methods. AI also helps teams search for existing drugs that might be repurposed for rare conditions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These advances are unlocking new treatment possibilities. Scientists are developing personalized therapies, including RNA-based treatments that target genetic errors without altering DNA.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In AVS, calcium deposits build up and narrow the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to move blood. The condition typically progresses over time, with symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue affecting people over age 65. The current standard of care — watchful waiting — often leads to reduced quality of life before the condition is severe enough for the patient to have a surgical or interventional <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valve replacement</a>.</p>

<p>"This research represents a significant advancement in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cardiovascular-disease-aging/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardiovascular Disease and Aging Laboratory at Mayo Clinic</a>. &nbsp;"Ataciguat has the potential to substantially delay or even prevent the need for valve replacement surgery, significantly improving the lives of millions."</p>



<p>Dr. Miller notes that the impact extends beyond simply delaying surgery. Younger patients with aggressive disease or congenital valve defects may develop symptoms in midlife. If a patient requires valve replacement before the age of 55, there is a more than 50% likelihood they will require multiple valve replacement surgeries over their lifetime due to recalcification of the implanted valve. Ataciguat, which slowed progression of native aortic valve calcification in the clinical trial, offers the potential for a once-in-a-lifetime procedure if they can reach the age of 65. The older a patient is, the less likely the implanted valve is to calcify.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Mayo Clinic's research revealed that ataciguat reactivates a pathway crucial in preventing valvular calcification and stenosis. Preclinical studies in mice showed that this drug substantially slowed disease progression even when treatment began after the disease was established. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical trials in patients with moderate AVS demonstrated that once-daily ataciguat dosing was well tolerated, with minimal side effects compared to placebo. This latest phase 2 trial in 23 patients showed a 69.8% reduction in aortic valve calcification progression at six months compared to placebo, and patients receiving ataciguat tended to maintain better heart muscle function. Crucially, the research team confirmed that — despite its profound effect on slowing valve calcification — ataciguat did not negatively impact bone formation.</p>



<p>This important finding is the result of a collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Minnesota, and Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The research was conducted under an innovative academic-industry partnership grant administered by the National Center for Accelerating Translational Sciences and a Minnesota Biotechnology and Genomics Partnership grant.</p>

Women in the sandwich generation are especially affected. The sandwich generation is a term used for people who often juggle caring for both children and aging adults, balancing responsibilities like feeding, cleaning and medical care.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapoor-ekta-m-b-b-s/bio-20090811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ekta Kapoor,</a>&nbsp;a co-investigator of the study, says women providing 15 or more hours of care per week are especially affected, with half of them experiencing moderate or worse symptoms. She says more menopause conversations are crucial to help women understand and navigate this life transition.</p>

Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/SCRIPT-VIDEO-How-caregiving-affects-menopause.-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong><br><br>Most caregivers are women, and a majority of them are in their late 40s and early 50s — the same time frame during which menopause happens for most women.</p>



<p>How do they intersect? That's what Dr. Kapoor and her colleagues wanted to find out.</p>



<p>"It can take a toll on their physical health. It can take a toll on their mental health. And the same can be said about menopause symptoms also, which can significantly impact the quality of life in some women," she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a middle-aged woman looking sad, worried, depressed" class="wp-image-79121" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>Menopause symptoms are divided into three domains.</p>



<p>"You have somatic symptoms, like hot flashes, night sweats, joint pains, fatigue and heart palpitations, etc. Then, the psychological domain has mood problems, anxiety. And the urogenital has vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>



<p>Two findings from the study particularly stood out.</p>



<p>"Menopause symptoms across all domains, and not just the psychological domain, were affected, which was a surprise, No. 1. No. 2, when we tried to adjust for stress and the overall mental health of the women, this association between caregiving and menopause symptom burden persisted," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>



<p>The research, she says, emphasizes the need for better support for caregivers going through menopause and for better education of caregivers and their healthcare professionals regarding treatment options for menopause symptoms.</p>

<p>Dr. Curtis explains that discovering tumor-associated antigens that T cells recognize is crucial for the success of immunotherapeutic approaches in ovarian cancer, where the growth of cells that form in the ovaries multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy body tissue.</p>



<p>T cells are a critical component of the adaptive immune system. Their ability to recognize and respond to specific targets is fundamental to their function. They play a significant role in developing and treating cancer and are vital in the immune system's fight against infections.</p>



<p>The researchers characterized the tumor antigens generated from ovarian cancer using multi-omics approaches to determine their ability to trigger an immune response. Multi-omics encompasses using multiple “omes” (i.e., genome, proteome, microbiome, epigenome) to better understand the mechanisms of disease processes, detection, potential prevention and more focused therapies.</p>



<p>Researchers have previously focused on discovering newly formed antigens (neoantigens). However, a previous <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32047025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> revealed that neoantigens are rarely found in ovarian cancer samples, making them unattractive targets. While targeted immunotherapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors have been highly successful in treating multiple cancer types, patients with ovarian cancer have limited benefit from these approaches.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What lies ahead?</strong></h2>



<p>Researchers will explore cryptic antigens in designing new treatments, such as vaccines or immunotherapies, that could help the immune system target tumors more effectively. They plan to test these approaches in laboratory models and clinical trials to see if they work safely.</p>



<p>The next steps include larger-scale studies to identify the abundance of cryptic antigen expression across different tumor types and to understand how those levels of cryptic antigens may correlate with patients' responses to immunotherapy.</p>



<p>Such studies could pave the way for developing immunotherapies targeting cryptic antigens in other tumor types. Moreover, understanding how cryptic antigens are processed and presented could offer new strategies to help the body's immune system fight cancer. In the long term, these efforts could broaden the reach of immunotherapy to other forms of cancer that currently lack effective treatment options.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Heart surgery is a serious and invasive medical procedure, and that can be intimidating for a patient. A new study <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00474-9/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a> suggests that <a href="https://tryhealium.com/how-it-works" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">virtual reality (VR)</a> can be an effective tool to reduce preoperative anxiety in older patients undergoing their first <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20123422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-heart surgery</a>. While much of the research to date using VR involved younger patient populations, these research findings suggest that immersive VR was effective and well tolerated in older patients. These reductions in anxiety are particularly significant given the known link between preoperative anxiety and negative postoperative outcomes, including increased pain, reduced activity and higher medication use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research represents a step forward in improving the patient experience and potentially using this approach to optimize postoperative recovery," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, a cardiovascular disease researcher at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and senior author of the study.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dearani-joseph-a-m-d/bio-00083538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joseph Dearani, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stulak-john-m-m-d/bio-20133266" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Stulak, M.D.</a>, both cardiac surgeons at Mayo Clinic involved with the study, emphasize the importance of emotional state before and after cardiac surgery. "We currently offer music and massage therapy after cardiac surgery because we know what a negative impact high anxiety has on recovery from surgery. Our team is now exploring broader implementation of VR — which can be used at any time and place, inside or outside the hospital — throughout the surgical episode to further evaluate its impact on clinical outcomes."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike traditional anti-anxiety medications, which can have drawbacks such as increased difficulty placing the tube that helps a patient breathe during surgery and a longer time to remove the tube after surgery, VR offers a nonpharmacological alternative. The study also highlights the potential of VR as a flexible tool, with the tablet-based option providing a viable alternative for patients susceptible to VR-induced motion sickness.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research included 100 participants who were scheduled for open-heart surgery. Each patient wore a monitor to record vital signs and completed a standardized, clinically validated anxiety test before and after the VR intervention on the day of surgery. The test asked them to rate their current state with 20 questions related to feelings ranging from calm to upset. Participants rated each feeling on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 being "not at all" and 4 being "very much."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Half of the participants were assigned to a VR tablet and the other half to immersive VR goggles while they waited in the holding area prior to surgery. The VR provided a 10-minute nature experience with guided breathing as they viewed trees and a waterfront that changed through four seasons. The tablet played a video of the content seen by patients in VR, while people who used the immersive VR headset were able to look all around and identify environmental features, which helped them advance through the scene. Both interventions reduced the pulse rate of participants, but they did not affect respiration rate or oxygen levels.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall anxiety scores decreased an average of 2 points with the tablet treatment and 2.9 points with the VR goggles. Additionally, the researchers note that the scores improved considerably in up to seven of the anxiety-focused questions with the tablet and VR goggles. Several of those responses specifically represent a more positive outlook change from their previously negative feelings — a finding that has the researchers feeling optimistic about the abilities of VR to make surgery less stressful for patients.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asthma</a> is a condition in which the airways in the lungs narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus, making breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455,000 deaths, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>



<p>There is no cure for asthma, but its symptoms can be controlled. For patients with asthma, remission is considered the primary treatment goal, with fewer or no symptoms, and the patient requiring minimal to no medication to manage their condition.</p>



<p>Current asthma guidelines, including those of the <a href="https://www.ersnet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Respiratory Society</a> and the <a href="https://site.thoracic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Thoracic Society</a>, <a href="https://site.thoracic.org/"></a>define asthma severity based on a patient's medication dose — without taking into consideration the healthcare burden, such as how successfully patients can control their asthma, how often they visit their doctor, visit the emergency room and receive other healthcare services. In other words, what has been missing from the research behind current guidelines is data from the perspective of the patient's quality of life.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers propose a new, personalized approach to asthma using patient-centered information based on healthcare burden data instead of prescribed medication, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00250-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.</p>



<p>The Mayo-led study is the first to use two longitudinal asthma cohorts from the U.S. and 11 European countries to introduce a tool that measures both asthma control and severity and translates that data into a quantifiable exacerbation – a way to measure the risk of an asthma attack.</p>



<p>The investigators analyzed data from 1,037 adult participants from the <a href="http://www.severeasthma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severe Asthma Research Program III</a> in the U.S. and the <a href="https://europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-campaigns/past-projects/u-biopred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes</a> to calculate a composite asthma burden score based on asthma attacks and healthcare. They also added the number of instances each patient needed a rescue bronchodilator to reflect asthma symptom burden.</p>

<p>The lead author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zein-joe-m-d-ph-d/bio-20563702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Zein, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a pulmonary medicine and asthma researcher at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, says the findings show discrepancies between the current definition of asthma severity and the research team's burden score.</p>



<p>"The standard definition of severe asthma is based on prescribed asthma medications," says Dr. Zein. "Our personalized healthcare burden score includes patient-centered data that reflect disease severity and accurately predicts asthma remission."</p>



<p>Dr. Zein says the study looks at asthma remission using two well-characterized asthma cohorts. "Asthma remission has been proposed as a hypothesis. That is something we look at, but no one was analyzing the data to test it. This is the first study to test the concept of asthma remission," he says.</p>



<p>If further studies support the team's method of calculating asthma burden, it ultimately could help care teams better manage cases of high-risk individuals with asthma and improve their treatment.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S155372502400165X" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> study</a> highlights how a new debriefing tool is helping to improve the mental well-being of nurses.</p>



<p>The tool, which goes by the acronym BONE Break, is a structured approach designed to help address the emotional and psychological distress known as Second Victim Syndrome which can be experienced by people within healthcare teams.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"Second Victim Syndrome is the emotional toll that can occur after an adverse event in the hospital," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hess-amberly-r-aprn-cns-d-n-p/bio-20578380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amberly Hess, D.N.P.,</a> lead author of the study. "It's the feeling of guilt, self-blame and trauma that can arise when a healthcare worker is involved in or witnesses an adverse patient event."</p>



<p>To understand the debriefing tool's impact, researchers examined its use with registered nurses (RNs) in a 24-bed inpatient unit at Mayo Clinic over a nine-month time frame.</p>



<p>The BONE break tool is designed to be implemented within the first 30 minutes following an event, and to offer peer support and emotional processing to the nurses involved. The nurses who participated reported that they considered over 95% of the sessions helpful.</p>



<p>"One of the most significant insights we gained within the study was the difference between intellectualizing and emotionally processing what happens to us," says Hess.</p>



<p>"When I would run the BONE Break tool, I saw the physiologic changes in nurses," she adds. "I watched the shoulders relax and release tension."</p>



<p>Hess emphasizes that the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> played a pivotal role in developing and evaluating the BONE Break tool.</p>



<p>"The Kern Center provided the framework and allowed the study to grow," says Hess.</p>

<p>"The nursing staff brought this study to the Kern Center and the collaboration was great," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/blocker-renaldo-c-ph-d/bio-20121385" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Renaldo Blocker, Ph.D.,</a>&amp;nbsp;a human factors engineering researcher and senior author of the study.</p>



<p></p>



<p>Dr. Blocker is a Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Honored Investigator and leads a research team on cognitive engineering and neuroergonomics within the Kern Center.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Researchers note that the nurses who participated were responsible for collecting data immediately following each BONE Break session, including the type of event, such as a patient fall.</p>



<p>The BONE Break debriefing process consisted of the following steps.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Buoy/Break:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Nurses took a silent break or short pause to allow for space, then reflected on the statement, "You are a good nurse working in a very complex environment.<a>"</a> Peers then offered support using phrases such as "I cannot imagine what that must have been like for you. Can we talk about it?"</li>



<li><strong>Open-Up:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The nurses then invited each other to talk about the event that had just occurred: "This has to be difficult. Are you OK?" and "How are you doing after the event?<a>"</a></li>



<li><strong>Needs:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Nurses assessed one another’s needs following the event: "What do you need right now to be able to be successful in returning to work?"&amp;nbsp;They offered each other affirmations surrounding those needs: "I believe in you."</li>



<li><strong>Exit/Evaluate:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Afterward, nurses discussed the effectiveness of the debriefing before returning to the floor.</li>
</ul>



<p>"This study highlights the importance of practitioners and scientists working together to evaluate, assess and implement these formative tools," says Dr. Blocker.</p>



<p>Researchers hope to expand the debriefing tool to other healthcare teams.</p>



<p>"This is an easy tool to implement, and it takes just a couple of people to make it happen," says Hess. "If anybody's interested in enhancing the culture of their team, this is a good tool to have available."</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When Mayo Clinic approached Phoenix resident Kory Billie about helping researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rusk-annie-m-m-d/bio-20524022" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Rusk, M.D.</a>, design a tobacco cessation intervention tailored for Native Americans, he jumped at the chance.</p>



<p>Billie, who has smoked most of his life, understands how using tobacco can negatively affect many aspects of a person's health. He is also a member of the Navajo Nation and has witnessed the challenges that family, friends and other members of his tribe have faced quitting tobacco. In recent years, he has watched the rising use of vaping among Navajo youth with concern. He wants to discourage young people from using tobacco except for ceremonial purposes.</p>

</div></div>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Billie's experiences made him an ideal candidate to advise Dr. Rusk on her research through a Mayo Clinic program called <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/community/community-engaged-research-program/resources/engagement-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Community Engagement (CE) Studios.</a></p>



<p>CE Studios is a consultation service that connects researchers to a group of "community experts" who represent the researcher's population of interest. These experts meet with the researcher, usually during a study's planning phase, to learn how the study is being designed, ask questions and provide feedback.</p>



<p>Since Mayo Clinic introduced CE Studios in 2021, Dr. Rusk has used it numerous times. She believes community input is essential for all research projects, regardless of their focus.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"By involving people with lived experiences, we can gain valuable insights and ensure our research is relevant and impactful," says Dr. Rusk. "Even discovery science projects taking place in a lab can benefit from community perspectives."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lived experiences provide key insights</strong></h2>



<p>For the CE Studios session with Dr. Rusk, Billie joined three other community experts from tribes in the Midwest, Alaska and Canada in a virtual meeting. The four community experts were there to advise Dr. Rusk on <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20561829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new clinical trial</a>.</p>

</div></div>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Rusk's research focuses on understanding barriers to smoking cessation among Native Americans. She felt it was important to consult with people from a variety of Indigenous communities to ensure her research aligned with their community health needs and priorities.</p>



<p>Billie says he enjoyed this opportunity to connect with like-minded people from similar backgrounds, and to speak with Dr. Rusk about how tobacco use was affecting communities like his. He shared his experiences with homelessness and addiction, as well as the difficulty of accessing smoking cessation resources in Indian Country.</p>



<p>What Dr. Rusk learned from Billie and the other community experts during the CE Studios session motivated her to make an important change to her study design.</p>



<p>The elements of the study that resonated best with the community experts were those geared toward developing practical behavioral health interventions. Billie and the other experts emphasized that understanding the social and cultural drivers of smoking would be key to achieving meaningful outcomes. &amp;nbsp;"You have to understand a person's environment and the way they're brought up," says Billie.</p>



<p>The community experts were less keen on a genetic analysis component Dr. Rusk had planned to include. They felt this aspect did not align meaningfully with community health priorities. Based on this feedback, Dr. Rusk eliminated this component from her study.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While incorporating this kind of feedback can be challenging, Dr. Rusk says the long-term benefits are worth it for all.</p>



<p>"Science seeking to cure disease and transform the way we deliver healthcare requires a direct connection to the people we serve," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Health is a blessing</strong></h2>



<p>Billie says he appreciated this chance to participate in CE Studios. He hopes that the knowledge he and the other experts shared will give Dr. Rusk the context she needs to develop a tobacco intervention that will have a lasting impact. He looks forward to hearing from her upon completion of the study to see the results.</p>



<p>He encourages other people to consider participating in CE Studios to help advance research to improve the health of their communities. He connects his motivation for this work to a Navajo proverb that reminds his people to live their lives with purpose:</p>



<p>"Remember to walk in beauty. Beauty before you and beauty behind you."</p>



<p>If the community can improve the health of its people today, he says, they will pass that blessing on to future generations.</p>

<p>"There's really no one singular variant in the genome that causes common diseases. It's really a lot of different variants across the genome, across our genomes that have weaker or milder effects on disease risk, but all together give us this increased risk," explains Dr. Ortega.</p>



<p>"With those discoveries, we've developed genetic risk scores, polygenic risk scores, where we bring together the effects or associations across variants, across entire genomes into a singular score," he continues.</p>



<p>Clinicians can then utilize these risk scores to potentially customize prevention and treatment strategies.</p>



<p>"These are quite early in development, but are potentially really, really important," says Dr. Wain. "In the future, we could use these to improve diagnosis where somebody is already presenting with the disease, but they need a specific diagnosis in order to access the medicines that are going to work for them." Dr. Ortega says the potential of polygenic risk scores is both exciting and promising.
