<p><br>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A discovery by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers may help explain why immunotherapy hasn't been helpful for many patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. In findings published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-0853/751983/Spatially-resolved-multi-region-proteomics-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Cancer Research</a>, the team identified specific proteins — fibronectin and smooth muscle actin — within colorectal cancer tissues that are associated with resistance to immunotherapy treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2025/02/26/what-is-cancer-immunotherapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Immunotherapy</a> is a major advance in treating cancer, but many patients, including those with metastatic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>, do not respond to it. Until now, researchers have not known why.</p>



<p>"We need predictive biomarkers to guide the selection of immunotherapy for patients," says medical oncologist and gastroenterologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, the senior author of the study. "Identifying those who may have resistance to treatment can be useful, because then we can spare them from receiving treatment that may not be beneficial and could produce significant toxicities."</p>



<p>The research team used <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/spatial-biology-puts-potential-disease-targets-in-their-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">digital spatial profiling</a>, an advanced technology that simultaneously analyzes the expression of multiple proteins and where they are located within tissues. This approach allowed researchers to zoom in to get a bird's eye view of a tumor that includes proteins both within and surrounding the tumor cells and how they interact.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope compares the spatial tools to an aerial view of a neighborhood where one can see relationships between driveways, houses, yards and neighboring structures. Similarly, this detailed view provides physicians and researchers with critical information about the proteins in and around a patient's cancer, potentially informing the best treatment for the patient.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We wanted to learn more about the patients who did not respond to immunotherapy. We investigated the leading edge of the tumor where cancer cells are invading and where the immune system is attempting to fight the cancer," says Dr. Sinicrope. "It's like a battle going on here and we're getting a snapshot into who is in attendance."</p>



<p>The researchers focused on 10 regions at the invasive margin of a tumor. They applied digital spatial profiling to investigate 71 distinct proteins in both the tumor's epithelial compartment and the surrounding stromal compartment. Fibronectin and smooth muscle actin are two extracellular matrix proteins that were found in the epithelial region of the tumor and were associated with resistance to immunotherapy and shorter time before disease progression.</p>



<p>Upon further analysis, the researchers observed that cancer-associated fibroblasts were producing these proteins. The evidence, they say, suggests that these proteins can contribute to suppression of the anti-tumor immune response.</p>



<p>The discovery offers a step toward more personalized and effective colorectal cancer treatments. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Location, location, location" may be a familiar mantra in real estate, but in the world of biology, it's proving just as essential. Spatial biology is a rapidly evolving field that maps the precise location of molecules within cells and tissues. It is changing the way biomedical research is conducted, spurring advances in our understanding of health and disease.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/TamasOrdog.jpg" alt="Photo of Tamas Ordog, M.D." class="wp-image-400625" style="width:168px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/TamasOrdog.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/TamasOrdog-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tamas Ordog, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Spatial biology allows us to study how the local environment influences cellular interactions and behavior," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ordog-tamas-m-d/bio-00095251" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tamas Ordog, M.D.</a>, professor of physiology at Mayo Clinic and director of the <a href="https://intranet.mayo.edu/charlie/spatial-multiomics-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spatial Multiomics Core</a>. "In all honesty, you can hardly find a problem in biology and medicine that is not a spatial problem."</p>



<p>Unlike traditional methods that analyze biological samples in bulk or as single cells, spatial biology uses sophisticated techniques to study molecules in their natural context. The approach marries old-school histology methods involving stains and microscopy with modern-day tools like sequencing and mass spectrometry.</p>



<p>For example, researchers can attach unique molecular <a>"</a>barcodes" to specific targets, such as RNA or proteins, while preserving their position within the architecture of the tissue. They then use high-resolution fluorescent microscopy to "read out" the barcodes to identify the tagged molecules at their location.</p>



<p>Alternatively, they can incorporate location barcodes into the "libraries" of molecules collected from the histological specimens, allowing the simultaneous detection of the targeted RNA or proteins and their location by sequencing. They then decode the barcodes associated with the molecules and combine that information with the spatial data to create maps showing how the molecules are spread across the tissue.</p>



<p>Dr. Ordog says he and his team often refer to their work as "spatial multi-omics" because it integrates multiple layers of "omics" data (such as genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and proteomics) with spatial information.</p>



<p>"Soon, we will be able to generate an insane amount of information within a very short time with the technologies out there," he says.</p>



<p>This information — which charts where specific molecules are located and how they interact in space — gives scientists a much more detailed, dynamic view of biology. It's particularly transformative in studying diseases like cancer, where the tumor microenvironment plays a key role in disease progression and treatment response.</p>



<p>"Cancer is often a mass of tissue, and the cells that sit inside can behave quite differently depending on whether the tumor is infiltrated by immune cells or only surrounded by them," says Dr. Ordog. "Spatial biology can help us interrogate these interactions."</p>



<p>This emerging discipline can also help researchers tease apart the multiple cell types that make up atherosclerotic plaques, a key feature in the development of cardiovascular disease. And, in the case of Dr. Ordog's own research, it can give insight into how cell-to-cell interactions give rise to diabetic complications of the gastrointestinal tract.</p>



<p>"In diabetes, metabolic dysfunction influences various regulatory cells in the muscle layer of the gut," he says. "We can use spatial biology to assess which cells are more prone to metabolic damage than others."</p>



<p>By revealing how cellular environments shape various biological processes, Dr. Ordog says spatial biology can contribute to the understanding of disease and lead to more precise, personalized medical treatments.</p>



<p>"We can apply these sophisticated discovery techniques to routine patient samples, and in this way shorten the time it takes to translate basic research findings into advances in clinical care," he says.</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ehf2.15027" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> has made a data-driven discovery for patients with heart failure in the intensive care unit.</p>



<p>Using machine learning, the researchers identified groups of patients with heart failure with higher and lower risk of mortality based on underlying patterns of laboratory values.</p>



<p>"The goal of this study was to explore different groups in the larger population of patients with heart failure admitted to the cardiac ICU," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jentzer-jacob-c-m-d/bio-20152381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Jentzer, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-d-patricia-e-kern-center-science-health-care-delivery/education-training/kern-health-care-delivery-scholars-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kern Health Care Delivery Scholar</a> and lead author of the study. "Recognizing that a critically ill heart failure patient belongs to one of these groups can help clinicians understand their likely underlying disease process and prognosis, allowing individualized therapy with the goal of improving outcomes."</p>

<p>Through the analysis, Dr. Jentzer and his colleagues identified five distinct groups, including patients with evidence of iron deficiency, kidney dysfunction, inflammation and poor blood flow. Each group had unique characteristics and risk profiles. Researchers underscore that by identifying these distinct groups, clinicians can craft treatment plans for each patient's needs and help to enhance outcomes and overall quality of care.</p>



<p>The groups in the study included:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Uncomplicated:</strong> Patients generally had milder disease.</li>



<li><strong>Iron-deficient:</strong> Signs of iron deficiency, which can significantly impact heart function.</li>



<li><strong>Cardiorenal:</strong> Patients showed signs of kidney dysfunction, which is a common complication of severe heart failure.</li>



<li><strong>Inflamed:</strong> Patients revealed signs of significant inflammation.</li>



<li><strong>Hypoperfused:</strong> Patients showed signs of poor blood flow to vital organs, indicating more severe heart failure.</li>
</ul>



<p>The findings revealed that the patients in the uncomplicated group generally had the best outcomes. In contrast, the patients in the inflamed, cardiorenal and iron-deficient groups all had an intermediate mortality risk.</p>



<p>Researchers note that patients in the hypoperfused group had the highest risk of mortality.</p>



<p>"The phenotypes and subgroups based on patterns of laboratory findings identified in this study have not been described before and could represent different noncardiac organ complications driven by different underlying biologic processes," says Dr. Jentzer. "This may help identify unique targeted therapies in a future study."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>A recent Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0091674925001228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;sought to understand the connection between a mother and son's health conditions and, along the way, discovered a broader implication for patients suffering from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-immunodeficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20376905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immunodeficiencies</a>.</p>



<p>Researchers revealed what appeared to be two separate health conditions — a mother's cancer and her son's persistent viral infections — stemmed from a single, shared genetic variant in what is known as the IRF8 gene, an important component of the immune system.</p>



<p>On the surface, the son's and mother's clinical presentations appeared worlds apart. The son had a persistent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mononucleosis/expert-answers/mononucleosis/faq-20058444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epstein-Barr virus</a> infection along with numerous respiratory issues, whereas the mother had developed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a>-related cancer.</p>



<p>Typically, the son would have been seen by infectious disease and pulmonary specialists while the mother would have gone to a gynecologist, with hardly any chance of professionals seeing a connection between the two and their respective conditions.</p>



<p>However, the boy's case, coupled with the discovery that his mother shared the same IRF8 variant and had developed an HPV-related tumor, sparked a deeper investigation among physicians and researchers at Mayo Clinic. Two Mayo clinicians, Thomas Boyce, M.D., initially, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ristagno-elizabeth-h-m-d/bio-20448052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elizabeth Ristagno, M.D.</a>, subsequently were instrumental in acting as a bridge between the practice and research in this case.</p>

<p>"Finding the variant and proving its effect on the patients' immune systems made it clear that their different clinical manifestations had the same underlying biological cause," says Amir Sadighi Akha, M.D., D.Phil., a consultant and laboratory director at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic</a>, the co-senior author of the study. "In a way, our findings gave their condition a name."</p>



<p>Researchers emphasized the importance of team science in this achievement and that no single group has the expertise to tackle a study like this alone.</p>



<p>In this respect, the work done by a group led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Immunology and co-senior author of the paper, was crucial to understanding how this variant carries out its effects, says Dr. Sadighi Akha.</p>

<p>"Working on immunodeficiencies is exciting and challenging at the same time, particularly when the disease under study is extremely rare, such as this one," Dr. Billadeau says. "The only way to do it is through concerted efforts by physicians and scientists in different disciplines, as was the case here."</p>



<p>"The more we did, the more the effect of this genetic variant came into focus, and the more excited we became," Dr. Sadighi Akha says.</p>



<p>They underscore that the more people know about these diseases and their consequences, the more beneficial it could be to both patients and the broader understanding of immunological diseases, including how they lead to increased risk of infections and cancers.</p>



<p>They note that the methods used in this study and its findings could help identify other cases of immunodeficiency and play a role in deciding how best to treat them.</p>



<p>They also believe that Mayo Clinic is among a select group of institutions that can undertake this type of work. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona will reimagine the healthcare experience for patients and staff and expand clinical space on the Phoenix campus by nearly 60%</strong></p>



<p>PHOENIX — Today, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announced a nearly $1.9 billion investment in the continued transformation of its <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix campus</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mayo-clinic_boldforwardunbound-activity-7178404334513115137-Kx0y?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAABwoiTIBzY17D8a6Q3RNtn4GbvE-QYUZDCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bold. Forward.</a> strategy to Cure, Connect and Transform healthcare for the benefit of patients everywhere.</p>



<p>Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona will enable new innovative care concepts, physical spaces and integrated technologies to create seamless care experiences for patients and a better workplace for staff.</p>



<p>Mayo’s largest investment in the state, Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona underscores Mayo Clinic's leadership in creating a next-generation healthcare model that scales solutions for more patients when and where they need them. By harnessing the power of innovative technology and integrating physical and digital care, Mayo Clinic aims to deliver more cures, improve patient outcomes and elevate the patient experience.</p>



<p>"Bold. Forward. Unbound. in Arizona is the final major building block of Bold. Forward. Unbound., our complete reimagining of our physical infrastructure to enable all of Bold. Forward.," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farrugia-gianrico-m-d/bio-20053394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gianrico Farrugia, M.D.</a>, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic. "Through this work, we are physically and digitally transforming healthcare and blurring the lines between inpatient and outpatient care to support Category-of-One healthcare for our patients, a Category-of-One workplace for our staff and to serve as a blueprint for the world."</p>



<p>This 1.2-million-square-foot expansion includes the construction of a new procedural building, a four-floor vertical and horizontal expansion of the Mayo Clinic Specialty Building, the integration of leading-edge technology, the addition of 11 new operating rooms and two new patient units supporting 48 additional beds, and an enhanced arrival experience for patients and visitors.</p>



<p>The plan calls for a two-story, indoor promenade that wraps around the front of the campus, creating cohesion and convenience for patients and visitors as they move from building to building. Another prominent feature in the new design will be the development of care neighborhoods that cluster complementary clinical services for a more intuitive and connected patient experience.</p>

<p>"The dramatic growth in our metropolitan area, state and region has led to an escalating need for care of patients with complex medical conditions that is difficult to accommodate with our current technology and infrastructure," according to Dr. Gray. "We continue to believe that Arizona is a great place to advance new cures, new collaborations and Mayo's distinctive model of care."</p>

<p>In 1931, Dr. William J. Mayo observed, "Each day, as I go through the hospitals surrounded by younger men [and women], they give me of their dreams and I give them of my experience, and I get the better of the exchange."</p>



<p>Nearly a century later, these sentiments still ring true. Residents and fellows not only uphold the values of Mayo Clinic but also have an immeasurable influence on patient care, research, education and the communities where they train. As Mayo Clinic marks National Thank a Resident and Fellow Day on Friday, Feb. 28, it recognizes the countless contributions that its residents and fellows make.</p>



<p>"We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the residents and fellows who have entrusted us with their training. These professionals represent our future workforce," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sadosty-annie-t-m-d/bio-20054407" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annie Sadosty, M.D.</a>, dean of the <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education (MCGSME)</a>. "Graduate medical education is essential to what we do at Mayo Clinic, and we appreciate the commitment and compassion that our trainees bring to our institution. Every day, but especially today, we want to tell our residents and fellows 'Thank you for all that you do.'"</p>



<p>MCSGME's residents and fellows don't just make a mark in our hospitals, they deliver the Mayo Model of Care to their local communities and beyond through service learning and volunteering.</p>



<p>Here is what some local leaders had to say about our residents:</p>

<p>More than 2,000 residents and fellows are enrolled in 309 specialty programs across Mayo Clinic. In 2018, the Gold Humanism Honor Society dedicated a day of recognition to residents and fellows, encouraging medical students at chapters throughout the nation to show their gratitude and appreciation. Thank a Resident and Fellow Day has since expanded to hundreds of programs around the country.

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a new role that a specific protein plays in regulating cell resistance and fighting tumors in certain types of cancer, offering hope for improved cancer therapies and patient outcomes.</p>



<p>The protein, known as NKG7, is found in CD8+ T cells, a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill cancer cells. CD8+ T cell resilience is essential for anti-tumor activity. The protein allows CD8+ T cells to continue killing cancer cells even under stress and can help prevent cancer from growing and spreading.</p>



<p>"We found that patients with invasive bladder cancer who had NKG7-expressing CD8+ T cells within their tumor had superior survival compared to patients without," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/billadeau-dan-d-ph-d/bio-00027415" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dan Billadeau, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study, detailed in <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11829009/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Communications</a>. "This discovery holds promise for manipulating CD8+ T cells — for example, CAR-T and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) — to combat cancer."</p>



<p>T cell-based immunotherapy is a developing field that treats many types of cancers. However, Dr. Billadeau explains that a significant problem in using these therapies is that many patients may experience a transient or short-term response followed by cancer progression.</p>



<p>There are two main types of T-cell-based therapies:</p>



<p>CAR T-cell therapy takes T cells from patients and modifies them to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR). CARs are proteins that recognize specific antigens on cancer cells, allowing the T cells to target and kill cancer cells more effectively. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>TIL (tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes) therapy involves taking T cells from a patient's tumor and growing them in a lab. Then, the cells are returned to the patient in a higher dose.</p>



<p>NKG7 is a protein expressed in cytotoxic lymphocytes like CD8+ T cells and natural killer cells. A prior Mayo Clinic <a href="http://10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-21-0539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">s</a><a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/10/2/162/678013/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tudy</a> had linked it to durable responses from anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with melanoma, a skin cancer. However, the mechanism remained unclear.</p>



<p>Dr. Billadeau says that in this new work, the team investigated how the NKG7 protein might make CD8+ T cells more resilient and able to combat cancer cells more efficiently.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="670" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-383780" style="width:218px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-670x1024.jpg 670w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD-196x300.jpg 196w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Daniel-Billadeau-PhD.jpg 736w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Daniel Billadeau, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We showed that NKG7 works at the lysosome, an organelle in the cell's cytoplasm, to restrain the overactivation of mTOR, a protein that regulates cell growth and which limits the persistence of functional CD8+ T cells," says Dr. Billadeau. "We discovered a role of NKG7 in the longevity of effector CD8+ T cells that are crucial in the control of cancer progression."</p>



<p>The manipulation of NKG7 expression can be used in CAR-T and TIL therapy to enhance their function and increase anti-cancer responses. The findings may also aid in cancer prognosis, as high NKG7 expression in CD8+ T cells in a tumor might correlate with a better clinical outcome. The NKG7 levels in CD8+ T cells in cancer tissues and peripheral blood may predict responses to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, another therapy that helps the immune system fight cancer, but this needs further validation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The team's work suggests that providing NKG7 proteins to various CD8+ T cell therapies, such as CAR-T and TIL, will give these T cell therapies a more resilient phenotype, leading to better patient outcomes. The team is working on several projects to add NKG7 to these therapies and test them in animal models. They are also performing studies in other cancers to use CD8+/NKG7+ T cells to predict survival and response to different cancer immunotherapies.</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-9d429618f26cd0b086d8f52428b40dc4" style="color:#908e8e">(<em>Video: Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D., medical director of Mayo Clinic’s Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases, analyzes genetic data on screen, uncovering insights into</em> <em>rare disease</em>.)</p>



<p>February 28 is <a href="https://www.rarediseaseday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rare Disease Day</a>, a time to recognize the millions of people worldwide living with conditions that often go undiagnosed or untreated. In the U.S., a disease is considered rare if it affects fewer than 200,000 people. </p>



<p>More than 7,000 rare diseases have been identified, many of them genetic. These conditions can affect vital organs, the nervous system, the immune system and other critical functions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>, researchers and clinicians are advancing precision medicine to improve diagnoses and develop treatments once thought impossible. A key part of this effort is the center's <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org//discussion/mayos-new-omics-strategy-leaps-into-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rare Disease Omics strategy</a>. This innovative approach moves discovery from the lab to patient care.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>By combining multiple layers of biological omics data, including genomics (study of genes), proteomics (study of proteins), and other molecular insights, scientists uncover how rare diseases form at their earliest stages and progress over time. Using omics tools, they identify mutations, examine disruptions in cellular function and trace how small errors in biological processes can lead to disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our goal is to build a discovery pipeline," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/curry-timothy-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Timothy Curry, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, the William O. Lund, Jr. and Natalie C. Lund Program Director for Clinomics, and the associate director of Practice Implementation at the Center for Individualized Medicine. Dr. Curry leads the center's Rare Disease Omics pillar.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Every breakthrough we make brings us closer to the day when rare diseases once thought untreatable can be managed or even cured," he says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial Intelligence helps accelerate research</strong></h2>



<p>Artificial intelligence helps researchers identify genetic mutations and patterns that are difficult to detect through traditional methods. AI also helps teams search for existing drugs that might be repurposed for rare conditions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These advances are unlocking new treatment possibilities. Scientists are developing personalized therapies, including RNA-based treatments that target genetic errors without altering DNA.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>In AVS, calcium deposits build up and narrow the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to move blood. The condition typically progresses over time, with symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue affecting people over age 65.

<p>"This research represents a significant advancement in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cardiovascular-disease-aging/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardiovascular Disease and Aging Laboratory at Mayo Clinic</a>. &nbsp;"Ataciguat has the potential to substantially delay or even prevent the need for valve replacement surgery, significantly improving the lives of millions."</p>



<p>Dr. Miller notes that the impact extends beyond simply delaying surgery. Younger patients with aggressive disease or congenital valve defects may develop symptoms in midlife. If a patient requires valve replacement before the age of 55, there is a more than 50% likelihood they will require multiple valve replacement surgeries over their lifetime due to recalcification of the implanted valve. Ataciguat, which slowed progression of native aortic valve calcification in the clinical trial, offers the potential for a once-in-a-lifetime procedure if they can reach the age of 65. The older a patient is, the less likely the implanted valve is to calcify.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Mayo Clinic's research revealed that ataciguat reactivates a pathway crucial in preventing valvular calcification and stenosis. Preclinical studies in mice showed that this drug substantially slowed disease progression even when treatment began after the disease was established. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical trials in patients with moderate AVS demonstrated that once-daily ataciguat dosing was well tolerated, with minimal side effects compared to placebo. This latest phase 2 trial in 23 patients showed a 69.8% reduction in aortic valve calcification progression at six months compared to placebo, and patients receiving ataciguat tended to maintain better heart muscle function. Crucially, the research team confirmed that — despite its profound effect on slowing valve calcification — ataciguat did not negatively impact bone formation.</p>



<p>This important finding is the result of a collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Minnesota, and Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The research was conducted under an innovative academic-industry partnership grant administered by the National Center for Accelerating Translational Sciences and a Minnesota Biotechnology and Genomics Partnership grant.</p>

<p>In a first-of-its-kind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00353-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic&nbsp;researchers found that women 45–60 years old who are managing family caregiving and menopause face nearly double the risk of moderate to severe&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/managing-menopause-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause symptoms</a>. Women in the sandwich generation are especially affected. The sandwich generation is a term used for people who often juggle caring for both children and aging adults, balancing responsibilities like feeding, cleaning and medical care.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapoor-ekta-m-b-b-s/bio-20090811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ekta Kapoor,</a>&nbsp;a co-investigator of the study, says women providing 15 or more hours of care per week are especially affected, with half of them experiencing moderate or worse symptoms. She says more menopause conversations are crucial to help women understand and navigate this life transition.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:32) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/SCRIPT-VIDEO-How-caregiving-affects-menopause.-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong><br><br>Most caregivers are women, and a majority of them are in their late 40s and early 50s — the same time frame during which menopause happens for most women.</p>



<p>How do they intersect? That's what Dr. Kapoor and her colleagues wanted to find out.</p>



<p>"It can take a toll on their physical health. It can take a toll on their mental health. And the same can be said about menopause symptoms also, which can significantly impact the quality of life in some women," she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a middle-aged woman looking sad, worried, depressed" class="wp-image-79121" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>Menopause symptoms are divided into three domains.</p>



<p>"You have somatic symptoms, like hot flashes, night sweats, joint pains, fatigue and heart palpitations, etc. Then, the psychological domain has mood problems, anxiety. And the urogenital has vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>



<p>Two findings from the study particularly stood out.</p>



<p>"Menopause symptoms across all domains, and not just the psychological domain, were affected, which was a surprise, No. 1. No. 2, when we tried to adjust for stress and the overall mental health of the women, this association between caregiving and menopause symptom burden persisted," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>



<p>The research, she says, emphasizes the need for better support for caregivers going through menopause and for better education of caregivers and their healthcare professionals regarding treatment options for menopause symptoms.</p>
