<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-heart-disease/">Heart disease</a> is the No. 1 cause of death in women in the U.S. African American women have an even higher risk of dying from heart disease ― and at a younger age ― than white women, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a>. Each year, more African American women die from heart disease than breast cancer, lung cancer and strokes — combined.</p>



<p>This serious issue is compounded by the fact that less than half of African American women are aware of their risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Factors that increase their risk of developing heart disease include:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having the highest rates of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, or hypertension, among non-Hispanic Black women.</li>



<li>Having the highest rates of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>&nbsp;among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women.</li>



<li>Being the least physically active group of women in the U.S.</li>



<li>Experiencing early onset of menstruation at less than 11 years of age.</li>



<li>Experiencing premature menopause at less than 40 years of age.</li>



<li>Developing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>.</li>



<li>Developing&nbsp;disorders related to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/high-blood-pressure-in-pregnancy-a-risk-factor-for-early-heart-disease/">high blood pressur</a>e&nbsp;during pregnancy.</li>



<li>Developing&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/gestational-diabetes-what-to-know-during-pregnancy/">gestational diabetes</a>.</li>



<li>Being prone to preterm delivery and having low- or high-birth weight babies.</li>



<li>Using oral contraceptives and hormone replacement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Being aware of and addressing these risk factors is important in preventing heart disease.</p>



<p>Another step toward making a healthy heart a priority is to follow the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Heart Association's "Life's Essential 8"</a>&nbsp;lifestyle changes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Manage blood pressure.</li>



<li>Control cholesterol.</li>



<li>Reduce blood sugar.</li>



<li>Get active.</li>



<li>Eat better.</li>



<li>Lose weight.</li>



<li>Quit tobacco.</li>



<li>Get healthy sleep</li>
</ol>



<p>Campaigns, such as&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/" target="_blank">Go Red for Women</a>, also help raise awareness about heart disease in women, risks and how-tos for healthy living.</p>



<p>If you have concerns about your heart health or would like to start your healthy-heart journey, consult your healthcare professional.</p>

<p>It's something Chicago Blackhawks General Manager Kyle Davidson has had to deal with all his life.</p>



<p>"I was born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetralogy-of-fallot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353477?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tetralogy of Fallot</a>. It's a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/congenital-heart-defects-children/symptoms-causes/syc-20350074?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congenital heart defect</a>. I needed two open-heart surgeries right around when I was a year old," Kyle says.</p>



<p>Five years ago, at the age of 31, Kyle had another open-heart surgery to place a new <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pulmonary-valve-repair-pulmonary-valve-replacement/about/pac-20385090?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary valve</a> inside his heart.</p>



<p>"It's pretty heavy surgery and long recovery. It was about one and a half, two months," he says.</p>



<p>But five years later, he's having trouble with his heart again.</p>



<p>"I've had a couple, you know, I'd call them episodes over the last number of months, where it didn't feel normal," Kyle says.</p>



<p>And at 36 years old, he's back in the hospital.</p>



<p>"I've learned that that valve is no longer working properly again, and intervention was needed," Kyle says.</p>



<p>"He was noticing a limitation in his ability to exercise to his peak potential. And when we hear a limitation for exercise tolerance, to me, that is a big red flag," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/anderson-jason-h-m-d/bio-20415337?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jason Anderson</a>, an interventional <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiovascular-medicine/sections/specialty-groups/orc-20122387?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at Mayo Clinic. "His valve was regurgitant, meaning he would send the blood forward. Part of the blood would come backward, and part would go forward. So every heartbeat, he's having some wasted flow that he's trying to keep up with. So your body compensates for that by trying to go faster and beat harder."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kyle-Davidson-Valve-1x1-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-401830" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kyle-Davidson-Valve-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kyle-Davidson-Valve-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kyle-Davidson-Valve-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kyle-Davidson-Valve-1x1-1-768x767.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kyle-Davidson-Valve-1x1-1.jpg 1081w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kyles new valve</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>A replacement pulmonary valve is needed. There are two options: another open-heart surgery or a less invasive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pulmonary-valve-repair-pulmonary-valve-replacement/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20385092?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transcatheter procedure</a>.</p>



<p>"With all things being equal and having the two options on the table, I certainly preferred and was happy that the transcatheter approach was something that was applicable to my case," Kyle says.</p>



<p>"Compared to 2019 when I had my open-heart surgery, I'm just at a very different point in my life, you know. I do have the general manager's job. I do have two kids that weren't around five years ago. You have to make sure that you're putting yourself in the best situation, from a health standpoint, to be there for them for a long time," he adds.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, pulmonary valve replacement can be performed on eligible patients as a same-day transcatheter procedure — meaning no open-heart surgery and, typically, no hospital stay. It requires only a mild form of sedation and usually takes under an hour to perform.</p>



<p>"The procedure is basically to give him a new valve within his existing, surgically placed valve. We do that through a catheter method, where you place equipment into the heart. We work through a large tube that goes through the vein in his leg," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cabalka-allison-m-d/bio-20053223?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Allison Cabalka</a>, an interventional cardiologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"When that valve is deployed and opened, in the next heartbeat, he has his new valve functioning brand-new, right out of the box," says Dr. Anderson.</p>



<p>Another aspect of this procedure that sets Mayo apart is that it’s done in tandem by two Mayo Clinic cardiologists through a method called co-scrubbing.</p>



<p>"When Dr Anderson and I are working together, we often think of it as two co-pilots," says Dr. Cabalka. "If we have anything that's unexpected, we have collaborative decision, we have immediate response, and we have the ability to take care of any potential complications or any potential barriers to success to make that procedure go as smoothly as possible."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Anderson-and-Dr-Cabalka16x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Dr. Allison Bavalka and Dr. Jason Anderson in surgery, working on a heart." class="wp-image-401832" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Anderson-and-Dr-Cabalka16x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Anderson-and-Dr-Cabalka16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Anderson-and-Dr-Cabalka16x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Anderson-and-Dr-Cabalka16x9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Dr-Anderson-and-Dr-Cabalka16x9.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Cabalka and Dr. Anderson in surgery</figcaption></figure>



<p>And just a few hours after the procedure, Kyle is out of the hospital, heading home and back to work.</p>



<p>"I'm very fortunate that there are medical advances to the point where I don't have to step away, I don't have to miss any significant time," Kyle says.</p>



<p>Kyle’s experience is typical for patients at Mayo Clinic undergoing this procedure.</p>



<p>"It's not an exception that he went home the same day, that is now the norm," says Dr. Anderson. "His body is now able to achieve the same amount of forward flow with less stress and less exertion."</p>



<p>"Now that we're a couple weeks out and I'm back to my normal routine, I feel 100%. I feel great," Kyle says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;One of the biggest things I have missed since my office went remote is going on walks with my coworkers throughout the day. With so many added responsibilities at work, I can hardly find time to leave my desk. How is all this sitting affecting me? How can I find a balance?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;We understand the reality is that people have less and less time to exercise. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercising</a>&nbsp;before or after work is extremely important, it is just as important to stay active throughout the day. You may be surprised to hear that sitting for eight or more hours a day is comparable to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a>&nbsp;a pack of cigarettes a day in terms of heart risk. Sitting for too long throughout the day is one of the major risk factors for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>&nbsp;and many medical conditions. The solution? An active office can empower you to break out of a sedentary lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An active workstation is essentially a desk where you are not sitting. This can mean a standing desk or one where you move around, such as biking, walking or using a step machine. An active workstation has many benefits. The main benefit is that it allows the user to be productive while burning calories at the same time. Walking pads or treadmills allow you to walk at a slow speed and answer emails, work on a project or participate in a video conference call.</p>



<p>An active workstation does not mean that you need to be moving all the time. And you don't have to be active for too long to reap the benefits of activity. It has been shown that even when you are standing, you are more likely to be spontaneously mobile than when you are sitting. This is important to keep in mind. Overall, sitting for less than three or four hours throughout the day is a good goal for those who are able.</p>



<p>Another concept that is gaining popularity is the idea of "snack" activities. A "snack" is doing something for two or three minutes after sitting for an hour. This helps you break the sedentary status of your body by taking the stairs for a few flights, doing some pushups or something meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then coming back and continuing your work. These little episodes of activity reset your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">m</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">tabolic</a>&nbsp;clock. Activity snacks can cause significant biological changes in your cells, metabolism and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">chol</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">sterol</a>. You may notice your mind feeling sharper for the next half hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While "activity snacking" is an affordable way to implement movement into your daily routine, you don't need a lot of money or a big investment to switch up your office furniture. There are some adapters out there that you put on top of your desk to raise or lower your monitor or laptop computer, allowing you to stand. Some people get creative and use a stack of books or other existing items. The bottom line is that everyone should feel motivated to redesign their home offices in order to be active longer throughout the day. This leaves us with less room for excuses. And, if you have days where you’re stuck going into the office, you still have options. Consider taking the stairs instead of the elevator.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.,</strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</em></strong></p>

<p>Phoenix — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart disease</a> is the leading cause of death worldwide. One of the most common types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>. In the United States alone, it is estimated that every 40 seconds, someone has a heart attack. One of those people is country rap music artist <a href="https://coltford.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colt Ford</a>.</p>



<p>"I couldn't have been anymore on death's door. I died twice that day," recalls Colt, describing the massive heart attack that nearly claimed his life following a concert performance last year. "When one of the top heart doctors in the world looks at you and goes, 'You're 1% of 1%,' it can't get more dire than that."</p>



<p>The 55-year-old musician was performing a sold-out show with his band in Gilbert, Arizona, last April. After what Colt describes as "one of the band's best shows ever," he walked backstage, and moments later, he was found slumped over in a chair due to a massive heart attack. Colt says he was feeling great during the concert. "When I played the show that night, I could do anything," he recalls. Emergency crews quickly responded to the scene and rushed Colt to the hospital. "I woke up eight days later, and I couldn't pick up a cup with ice in it and feed it to myself," he says.</p>



<p>Colt went into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a> twice. He was revived with electric shocks from a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/in-depth/automated-external-defibrillators/art-20043909" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defibrillator</a> to restart his heart in both instances. "He would simply not have survived in most parts of the world that don't have access to such a high level of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiogenic-shock/symptoms-causes/syc-20366739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiogenic shock care</a>. Most people do not survive globally," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lee-kwan-s-m-b-b-ch-m-d/bio-20541747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kwan Lee, M.B., B.Ch., M.D.</a>, interventional cardiologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>. Colt also underwent a 10-hour surgery and, for a time, was placed in a medically induced coma.</p>



<p>Doctors often warn about the signs and symptoms of a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain or pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. However, roughly 21% of heart attacks in the U.S. occur with minimal or even no symptoms, according to the American Heart Association. These <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"silent" heart attacks</a> are known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent ischemia</a> or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent myocardial infarction</a>.</p>



<p>"This is the unfortunate nature of heart attacks. It is possible to have tests which don't show <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockages</a>, but the nature of blockages is that they can behave unpredictably and suddenly occur," says Dr. Lee. "Despite our best efforts, on a populational level, heart attacks can still occur in patients out of the blue."</p>



<p>Eight months after suffering his heart attack, tests show Colt is healing well and on the road to recovery. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/fitness-basics/hlv-20049447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercise</a> combined with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20046702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy diet</a> has helped him shed 60 pounds. While his strength improves, Colt admits the health scare has left him with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panic attacks</a>. "For me to say I'm having anxiety and panic attacks, that's even hard for me to say because I ain't scared of nothing," Colt says. "But I'm having to deal with that, and share my feelings and all that kind of stuff. So, if you're feeling something, advocate for yourself. Don't just tough it out. Tell somebody."</p>



<p>Colt is back to writing his signature blend of music that combines country, rap and hip-hop. The Georgia-born singer just released a new song and is about embark on a new tour. He's hoping his music and his story will serve as inspiration for others. "Be happy that you're here and you're alive and you get a chance," Colt says. "I get a second chance, and I want to do something positive with it. I hope I can make a difference in somebody else's life."</p>

<p>"Like it was really clicking. We had just made some changes in the set and it was feeling really good. The vibe was good, it all felt good," remembers Colt. "My stage manager said 'That's the best show we've done this year, man, you killed it,' It was incredible."</p>



<p>At the end of the show Colt thanked fans, turned and exited the stage.</p>

<p>"I woke up seven or eight days later, whatever, and I woke up in the hospital and was like 'What's going on?' I had no concept of anything," says Colt. "When I played the show that night I could do anything but when I woke up in the hospital I couldn't pick up a cup with ice in it and feed it to myself."</p>



<p>Minutes after exiting the stage, Colt suffered a massive heart attack. He was found slumped over in a chair backstage by one of his fellow band members. Emergency crews responded immediately and Colt was rushed to the hospital.</p>

<p>"When one of the top heart doctors in the world looks at you and goes 'You're 1% of 1%,' it can't get anymore dire than that," says Colt about his odds of surviving his heart attack.</p>



<p>Colt went into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634">arrest</a>&nbsp;twice.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart disease</a>&nbsp;is the leading cause of death worldwide. One of the most common types of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118"> disease</a>&nbsp;is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>. In the United States alone, it is estimated that every 40 seconds, someone has a heart attack.</p>



<p>Doctors often warn about the signs and symptoms of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain or pressure</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. However, roughly 21% of heart attacks in the U.S. occur with minimal or even no symptoms, according to the American Heart Association. These&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"silent" heart attacks</a>&nbsp;are known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent ischemia</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent myocardial infarction</a>.</p>



<p>Colt says he had recently undergone a regular check-up at a different medical center and got a clean bill of health.</p>



<p>"This is the unfortunate nature of heart attacks. It is possible to have tests which don't show&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockages</a>, but the nature of blockages is that they can behave unpredictably and suddenly occur," says Dr. Lee. "Despite our best efforts, on a populational level, heart attacks can still occur in patients out of the blue."</p>



<p>Nearly nine months after his heart attack, test results at Mayo Clinic indicate Colt is making excellent progress.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/fitness-basics/hlv-20049447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercise</a>&nbsp;combined with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20046702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy diet</a>&nbsp;has helped him shed 60 pounds. "I'm about back to being in my college shape," says Colt, who played on the golf team for the University of Georgia before his singing career took off.</p>

<p>While his physical health improves, Colt admits the health scare has left him battling&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panic attacks</a>. "For me to say I'm having anxiety and panic attacks, that's even hard for me to say because I ain't scared of nothing," Colt says. "But I'm having to deal with that and share my feelings and all that kind of stuff. So, if you're feeling something, advocate for yourself. Don't just tough it out. Tell somebody."</p>



<p>Dr. Lee says it is not uncommon for patients to experience anxiety, panic attacks and even depression following a heart attack. He recommends patients maintain an open dialogue with their health care team and discuss any issues that arise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>"I'm back, baby!</strong>"</h2>



<p>Colt has been open about sharing his experience with his nearly three million followers on social media. "I'm back, baby!" Colt shared recently on Instagram. "It's been quite a journey but you guys have inspired me, you kept loving me, kept praying for me, kept sending me messages and I'm working hard to get better."</p>



<p>Just a year shy of his heart attack, Colt has released a new song and is embarking on a new tour. He is hoping his music and story will serve as inspiration for others. </p>

<p>Different people need different amounts of sleep, and, on average, we can say most people need seven to eight hours," explains Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>He says to consider the quality of sleep, not the quantity. He offers these&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379">ideas&nbsp;</a>to help you have good sleep hygiene.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for better sleep</h2>



<p>"In the bedroom, you want absolute darkness," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a white woman sleeping peacefully in bed in a darkened room, with a soft light falling across her face" class="wp-image-364301" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>And that means no screens, no TV, no laptops, no phones, and no ticking clocks or LED displays.</p>



<p>"Avoid bright lights, avoid looking at your phones because light from there can affect your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-melatonin/art-20363071">melatonin</a>," Dr. Somers says. That's the hormone that regulates sleep.</p>



<p>He says when it comes to quality sleep, less stimulation is best.</p>



<p>"Minimize alcohol, minimize exercise, minimize lights, minimize external inputs before about two hours or so before bedtime. The bedroom is for sex and sleep. It's not for spreadsheets," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>Exercise can help improve sleep, but working out near bedtime can raise arousal levels, making it harder to sleep. And consider a sleep schedule. Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.</p>

<p-->February is American Heart Month. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. African Americans are significantly affected by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, resulting in higher mortality rates compared to white Americans.<p></p>



<p>One of the reasons for the disparity is the high <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertension</a> rates in the Black community. Hypertension, also known as high blood pressure, can increase your risk of developing heart disease.</p>

<p>The statistics are startling. One person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. High cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and hypertension can cause heart problems.</p>



<p>"African Americans, unfortunately, have the highest rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the world, which dramatically increases their risk for developing heart disease," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black Americans are disproportionately impacted by cardiovascular disease</h3>



<p>She says elevated hypertension rates in the Black community can be attributed to various factors, including chronic stress, systemic racism and socioeconomic issues.</p>



<p>"That includes food insecurity, housing insecurity, redlining, which really limits certain individuals from receiving opportunities and resources to better their health," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Dr. Brewer says simple lifestyle changes can reduce high blood pressure and heart disease, like eating healthier, getting regular physical activity and adequate sleep to reduce stress.</p>

<p>A new solution is transforming cardiac care by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in point-of-care ultrasound. This innovation enables a wider range of medical professionals to capture high-quality cardiac images with confidence, ultimately enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving clinical outcomes.

<p>The podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/friedman-paul-a-m-d/bio-20053442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Paul Friedman</a>, cardiologist and chair of Cardiovascular Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and <a href="https://ultrasight.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Davidi Vortman</a>, CEO of UltraSight. Together, Mayo Clinic and UltraSight are at the forefront of developing algorithms to analyze and interpret cardiac ultrasound images. The collaboration seeks to create a comprehensive solution to support diagnostic and treatment decisions using point-of-care ultrasound devices.</p>



<p>This AI-driven technology is designed to overcome existing barriers and expand access to high-quality cardiac imaging and diagnostics. UltraSight's innovation simplifies cardiac sonography by providing real-time guidance on maneuvering the ultrasound probe to capture high-quality images. Now, with the added power of AI, healthcare professionals can analyze those images more effectively.</p>



<p>"Historically, ultrasound has been somewhat difficult for an average person to get," says Dr. Friedman. "So, in many places around the world, if a physician orders an ultrasound of the heart, an echocardiogram, it may take several months to be scheduled."</p>



<p>"It hasn't been used for first-line screening because of those barriers. This is where some of the visionary work of a portable device that uses AI can turn that upside," he adds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This innovative technology isn't about replacing experts, notes Vortman. "We're not replacing the experts, we are giving them more data from more patients, faster than ever before. So AI is an accelerator for access that gives much better data at the right time," he says.</p>



<p>"It doesn't replace human interpretation and action, but it can provide a common groundwork for consistency," Dr. Friedman adds.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Vortman envisions a future where diagnostic tools are more accessible and affordable. "This is the future. Diagnostic tools like ultrasound that are low-cost and can be used by a wider variety of healthcare team members are going to be future of healthcare and disease detection," he says.</p>



<p>The collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic and UltraSight holds the potential to democratize cardiac care, offering hope faster and more efficiently.

<p>"It's usually recommended for you to sleep at least seven hours per night in order to allow your body to recover to be ready for the following day," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical steps to help you get better sleep</strong></h2>



<p>"Try to sleep at the same time. Try to get a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and you're waking up also at the same time, that's very important," Dr. Cardenas Rosales says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create good sleep habits</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.</li>



<li>Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.</li>



<li>Limit naps or do not nap at all.</li>



<li>Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.</li>



<li>Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.</li>



<li>Make your bedroom comfortable.</li>



<li>Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You want to set up the environment to make it easier for your body to fall asleep," he says.</p>

The final step to establish the drug's long-term effectiveness and safety is a phase 3 trial, and efforts to launch that pivotal trial are soon to be underway with an industry partner.</p>

<p>In AVS, calcium deposits build up and narrow the aortic valve, forcing the heart to work harder to move blood. The condition typically progresses over time, with symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath and fatigue affecting people over age 65. The current standard of care — watchful waiting — often leads to reduced quality of life before the condition is severe enough for the patient to have a surgical or interventional <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aortic-stenosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valve replacement</a>.</p>

<p>"This research represents a significant advancement in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/miller-jordan-d-ph-d/bio-00027578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Miller, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cardiovascular-disease-aging/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardiovascular Disease and Aging Laboratory at Mayo Clinic</a>. &nbsp;"Ataciguat has the potential to substantially delay or even prevent the need for valve replacement surgery, significantly improving the lives of millions."</p>



<p>Dr. Miller notes that the impact extends beyond simply delaying surgery. Younger patients with aggressive disease or congenital valve defects may develop symptoms in midlife. If a patient requires valve replacement before the age of 55, there is a more than 50% likelihood they will require multiple valve replacement surgeries over their lifetime due to recalcification of the implanted valve. Ataciguat, which slowed progression of native aortic valve calcification in the clinical trial, offers the potential for a once-in-a-lifetime procedure if they can reach the age of 65. The older a patient is, the less likely the implanted valve is to calcify.</p>



<p>Over the past decade, Mayo Clinic's research revealed that ataciguat reactivates a pathway crucial in preventing valvular calcification and stenosis. Preclinical studies in mice showed that this drug substantially slowed disease progression even when treatment began after the disease was established. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinical trials in patients with moderate AVS demonstrated that once-daily ataciguat dosing was well tolerated, with minimal side effects compared to placebo. This latest phase 2 trial in 23 patients showed a 69.8% reduction in aortic valve calcification progression at six months compared to placebo, and patients receiving ataciguat tended to maintain better heart muscle function. Crucially, the research team confirmed that — despite its profound effect on slowing valve calcification — ataciguat did not negatively impact bone formation.</p>



<p>This important finding is the result of a collaborative effort between Mayo Clinic, the National Institutes of Health, the University of Minnesota, and Sanofi Pharmaceuticals. The research was conducted under an innovative academic-industry partnership grant administered by the National Center for Accelerating Translational Sciences and a Minnesota Biotechnology and Genomics Partnership grant.</p>
