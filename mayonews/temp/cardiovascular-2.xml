<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;My friend swears by <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-is-intermittent-fasting-a-quick-fix-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intermittent fasting</a> since her recent weight loss. I know it works for some people, but is it actually healthy?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Although it may appear to be a new trend,&nbsp;intermittent fasting&nbsp;has been popular for over 1,500 years. While we know that it works for some people to lose weight, the reality is that whether or not it helps organs such as the heart is still to be determined. Early&nbsp;<a href="https://newsroom.heart.org/news/8-hour-time-restricted-eating-linked-to-a-91-higher-risk-of-cardiovascular-death#:~:text=CHICAGO%2C%20March%2018%2C%202024%20%E2%80%94%20An%20analysis%20of,Scientific%20Sessions%202024%2C%20March%2018-%2021%2C%20in%20Chicago.">research</a>&nbsp;presented at a recent scientific meeting suggested that intermittent fasting might be harmful or risky in general. It showed that people practicing intermittent fasting are twice as likely to die from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118">heart disease</a>&nbsp;or die in general than those who don't practice.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The main problem is that intermittent fasting is not standardized. There are many ways to do intermittent fasting. Over the past few decades, it has been popularized in the UK as "eat whatever you want for five days, then don't eat for two full days other than fluids and soups." People were losing weight, and from that point on, people started adapting to fasting in very different ways. Some people will restrict their time for eating to 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., for example. The most common form of intermittent fasting I have seen is that people just skip breakfast.<br>&nbsp;<br>Whether breakfast is "the most important meal of the day" is still under debate. Skipping breakfast historically hasn't been something necessarily healthy. It is not fully understood why, but there are numerous studies showing that people who skip breakfast have an increased risk for heart disease and other ailments. Early morning is the time when people have the most heart attacks. Part of the reason for that is the high-adrenaline state that occurs early in the morning. If you match that with no food, no calories at all, that might be the reason why studies show that people practicing intermittent fasting are not necessarily healthier or safer. I think that's important to keep in mind.<br>&nbsp;<br>People who lose weight through intermittent fasting can benefit their overall health, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that they have to continue forever. We have to consider many other factors when people don't have breakfast or other meals. Stress hormones go up, which may increase&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">blood pressure</a>&nbsp;and adrenaline, causing many changes in our system that might actually be more harmful than beneficial.<br>&nbsp;<br>When patients ask if intermittent fasting is healthy, the response should be, "It all depends." If they start skipping dinner, having very light dinners or just trying not to have dinner too late, that's an excellent way to practice. Or perhaps having a very light lunch or skipping lunch altogether — just not necessarily going for too long with no food.<br>&nbsp;<br>Studies show that having multiple small meals throughout the day versus just two big meals results in better&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/reduce-cholesterol/art-20045935">cholesterol</a> and many other positive changes in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">metabolism</a>. So, this idea of not having any food or calories for long periods of time is still under debate. Based on recent evidence, intermittent fasting is particularly unsafe for patients with heart disease or with a history of heart disease. Practicing intermittent fasting can be safer with supervision from your healthcare team.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705"><strong>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><br><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-heart-disease/">Heart disease</a> is the No. 1 cause of death in women in the U.S. African American women have an even higher risk of dying from heart disease ― and at a younger age ― than white women, according to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute</a>. Each year, more African American women die from heart disease than breast cancer, lung cancer and strokes — combined.</p>



<p>This serious issue is compounded by the fact that less than half of African American women are aware of their risk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Factors that increase their risk of developing heart disease include:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Having the highest rates of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, or hypertension, among non-Hispanic Black women.</li>



<li>Having the highest rates of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>&amp;nbsp;among non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic women.</li>



<li>Being the least physically active group of women in the U.S.</li>



<li>Experiencing early onset of menstruation at less than 11 years of age.</li>



<li>Experiencing premature menopause at less than 40 years of age.</li>



<li>Developing&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pcos/symptoms-causes/syc-20353439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>.</li>



<li>Developing&amp;nbsp;disorders related to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/high-blood-pressure-in-pregnancy-a-risk-factor-for-early-heart-disease/">high blood pressur</a>e&amp;nbsp;during pregnancy.</li>



<li>Developing&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/gestational-diabetes-what-to-know-during-pregnancy/">gestational diabetes</a>.</li>



<li>Being prone to preterm delivery and having low- or high-birth weight babies.</li>



<li>Using oral contraceptives and hormone replacement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Being aware of and addressing these risk factors is important in preventing heart disease.</p>



<p>Another step toward making a healthy heart a priority is to follow the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-lifestyle/lifes-essential-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Heart Association's "Life's Essential 8"</a>&amp;nbsp;lifestyle changes:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>Manage blood pressure.</li>



<li>Control cholesterol.</li>



<li>Reduce blood sugar.</li>



<li>Get active.</li>



<li>Eat better.</li>



<li>Lose weight.</li>



<li>Quit tobacco.</li>



<li>Get healthy sleep</li>
</ol>



<p>Campaigns, such as&amp;nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.goredforwomen.org/en/" target="_blank">Go Red for Women</a>, also help raise awareness about heart disease in women, risks and how-tos for healthy living.</p>



<p>If you have concerns about your heart health or would like to start your healthy-heart journey, consult your healthcare professional.</p>

<p>It's something Chicago Blackhawks General Manager Kyle Davidson has had to deal with all his life.</p>



<p>"I was born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetralogy-of-fallot/symptoms-causes/syc-20353477?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tetralogy of Fallot</a>.

I needed two open-heart surgeries right around when I was a year old," Kyle says.</p>



<p>Five years ago, at the age of 31, Kyle had another open-heart surgery to place a new <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pulmonary-valve-repair-pulmonary-valve-replacement/about/pac-20385090?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary valve</a> inside his heart.</p>



<p>"It's pretty heavy surgery and long recovery. It was about one and a half, two months," he says.</p>



<p>But five years later, he's having trouble with his heart again.</p>



<p>"I've had a couple, you know, I'd call them episodes over the last number of months, where it didn't feel normal," Kyle says.</p>



<p>And at 36 years old, he's back in the hospital.</p>

<p>"He was noticing a limitation in his ability to exercise to his peak potential.

"His valve was regurgitant, meaning he would send the blood forward. Part of the blood would come backward, and part would go forward.

<p>A replacement pulmonary valve is needed. There are two options: another open-heart surgery or a less invasive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pulmonary-valve-repair-pulmonary-valve-replacement/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20385092?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transcatheter procedure</a>.</p>



<p>"With all things being equal and having the two options on the table, I certainly preferred and was happy that the transcatheter approach was something that was applicable to my case," Kyle says.</p>



<p>"Compared to 2019 when I had my open-heart surgery, I'm just at a very different point in my life, you know. I do have the general manager's job. I do have two kids that weren't around five years ago. You have to make sure that you're putting yourself in the best situation, from a health standpoint, to be there for them for a long time," he adds.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, pulmonary valve replacement can be performed on eligible patients as a same-day transcatheter procedure — meaning no open-heart surgery and, typically, no hospital stay. It requires only a mild form of sedation and usually takes under an hour to perform.</p>



<p>"The procedure is basically to give him a new valve within his existing, surgically placed valve. We do that through a catheter method, where you place equipment into the heart. We work through a large tube that goes through the vein in his leg," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cabalka-allison-m-d/bio-20053223?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Allison Cabalka</a>, an interventional cardiologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"When that valve is deployed and opened, in the next heartbeat, he has his new valve functioning brand-new, right out of the box," says Dr. Anderson.</p>



<p>Another aspect of this procedure that sets Mayo apart is that it’s done in tandem by two Mayo Clinic cardiologists through a method called co-scrubbing.</p>



<p>"When Dr Anderson and I are working together, we often think of it as two co-pilots," says Dr. Cabalka. "If we have anything that's unexpected, we have collaborative decision, we have immediate response, and we have the ability to take care of any potential complications or any potential barriers to success to make that procedure go as smoothly as possible."</p>

<p>And just a few hours after the procedure, Kyle is out of the hospital, heading home and back to work.</p>



<p>"I'm very fortunate that there are medical advances to the point where I don't have to step away, I don't have to miss any significant time," Kyle says.</p>



<p>Kyle’s experience is typical for patients at Mayo Clinic undergoing this procedure.</p>



<p>"It's not an exception that he went home the same day, that is now the norm," says Dr. Anderson. "His body is now able to achieve the same amount of forward flow with less stress and less exertion."</p>



<p>"Now that we're a couple weeks out and I'm back to my normal routine, I feel 100%. I feel great," Kyle says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;One of the biggest things I have missed since my office went remote is going on walks with my coworkers throughout the day. With so many added responsibilities at work, I can hardly find time to leave my desk. How is all this sitting affecting me? How can I find a balance?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;We understand the reality is that people have less and less time to exercise. While&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercising</a>&nbsp;before or after work is extremely important, it is just as important to stay active throughout the day. You may be surprised to hear that sitting for eight or more hours a day is comparable to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a>&nbsp;a pack of cigarettes a day in terms of heart risk. Sitting for too long throughout the day is one of the major risk factors for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>&nbsp;and many medical conditions. The solution? An active office can empower you to break out of a sedentary lifestyle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An active workstation is essentially a desk where you are not sitting. This can mean a standing desk or one where you move around, such as biking, walking or using a step machine. An active workstation has many benefits. The main benefit is that it allows the user to be productive while burning calories at the same time. Walking pads or treadmills allow you to walk at a slow speed and answer emails, work on a project or participate in a video conference call.</p>



<p>An active workstation does not mean that you need to be moving all the time. And you don't have to be active for too long to reap the benefits of activity. It has been shown that even when you are standing, you are more likely to be spontaneously mobile than when you are sitting. This is important to keep in mind. Overall, sitting for less than three or four hours throughout the day is a good goal for those who are able.</p>



<p>Another concept that is gaining popularity is the idea of "snack" activities. A "snack" is doing something for two or three minutes after sitting for an hour. This helps you break the sedentary status of your body by taking the stairs for a few flights, doing some pushups or something meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then coming back and continuing your work. These little episodes of activity reset your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">m</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">tabolic</a>&nbsp;clock. Activity snacks can cause significant biological changes in your cells, metabolism and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">chol</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">sterol</a>. You may notice your mind feeling sharper for the next half hour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While "activity snacking" is an affordable way to implement movement into your daily routine, you don't need a lot of money or a big investment to switch up your office furniture. There are some adapters out there that you put on top of your desk to raise or lower your monitor or laptop computer, allowing you to stand. Some people get creative and use a stack of books or other existing items. The bottom line is that everyone should feel motivated to redesign their home offices in order to be active longer throughout the day. This leaves us with less room for excuses. And, if you have days where you’re stuck going into the office, you still have options. Consider taking the stairs instead of the elevator.&amp;nbsp;<em>—&amp;nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.,</strong></a><strong><em>&amp;nbsp;Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</em></strong></p>

<p>Phoenix — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart disease</a> is the leading cause of death worldwide. One of the most common types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> is a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>. In the United States alone, it is estimated that every 40 seconds, someone has a heart attack. One of those people is country rap music artist <a href="https://coltford.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colt Ford</a>.</p>



<p>"I couldn't have been anymore on death's door. I died twice that day," recalls Colt, describing the massive heart attack that nearly claimed his life following a concert performance last year. "When one of the top heart doctors in the world looks at you and goes, 'You're 1% of 1%,' it can't get more dire than that."</p>



<p>The 55-year-old musician was performing a sold-out show with his band in Gilbert, Arizona, last April. After what Colt describes as "one of the band's best shows ever," he walked backstage, and moments later, he was found slumped over in a chair due to a massive heart attack. Colt says he was feeling great during the concert. "When I played the show that night, I could do anything," he recalls. Emergency crews quickly responded to the scene and rushed Colt to the hospital. "I woke up eight days later, and I couldn't pick up a cup with ice in it and feed it to myself," he says.</p>



<p>Colt went into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac arrest</a> twice. He was revived with electric shocks from a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-arrhythmia/in-depth/automated-external-defibrillators/art-20043909" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">defibrillator</a> to restart his heart in both instances. "He would simply not have survived in most parts of the world that don't have access to such a high level of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiogenic-shock/symptoms-causes/syc-20366739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiogenic shock care</a>. Most people do not survive globally," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lee-kwan-s-m-b-b-ch-m-d/bio-20541747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kwan Lee, M.B., B.Ch., M.D.</a>, interventional cardiologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>. Colt also underwent a 10-hour surgery and, for a time, was placed in a medically induced coma.</p>



<p>Doctors often warn about the signs and symptoms of a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain or pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. However, roughly 21% of heart attacks in the U.S. occur with minimal or even no symptoms, according to the American Heart Association. These <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"silent" heart attacks</a> are known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent ischemia</a> or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent myocardial infarction</a>.</p>



<p>"This is the unfortunate nature of heart attacks. It is possible to have tests which don't show <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockages</a>, but the nature of blockages is that they can behave unpredictably and suddenly occur," says Dr. Lee. "Despite our best efforts, on a populational level, heart attacks can still occur in patients out of the blue."</p>



<p>Eight months after suffering his heart attack, tests show Colt is healing well and on the road to recovery. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/fitness-basics/hlv-20049447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercise</a> combined with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20046702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy diet</a> has helped him shed 60 pounds. While his strength improves, Colt admits the health scare has left him with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panic attacks</a>. "For me to say I'm having anxiety and panic attacks, that's even hard for me to say because I ain't scared of nothing," Colt says. "But I'm having to deal with that, and share my feelings and all that kind of stuff. So, if you're feeling something, advocate for yourself. Don't just tough it out. Tell somebody."</p>



<p>Colt is back to writing his signature blend of music that combines country, rap and hip-hop. The Georgia-born singer just released a new song and is about embark on a new tour. He's hoping his music and his story will serve as inspiration for others. "Be happy that you're here and you're alive and you get a chance," Colt says. "I get a second chance, and I want to do something positive with it. I hope I can make a difference in somebody else's life."</p>

<p>It was the evening of April 4, 2024 on a concert stage in Gilbert, Arizona.</p>



<p>Colt Ford and his band were performing their signature blend of country, rap and hip-hop music. It was a sold-out crowd. Colt was feeling at the top of his game, and the concert was shaping up to be one of the band's best shows ever.</p>



<p>No one expected how this night would end.</p>

<p>"Like it was really clicking. We had just made some changes in the set and it was feeling really good. The vibe was good, it all felt good," remembers Colt. "My stage manager said 'That's the best show we've done this year, man, you killed it,' It was incredible."</p>



<p>At the end of the show Colt thanked fans, turned and exited the stage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>No one expected what happened minutes later</strong></h2>

<p>"I woke up seven or eight days later, whatever, and I woke up in the hospital and was like 'What's going on?' I had no concept of anything," says Colt. "When I played the show that night I could do anything but when I woke up in the hospital I couldn't pick up a cup with ice in it and feed it to myself."</p>



<p>Minutes after exiting the stage, Colt suffered a massive heart attack. He was found slumped over in a chair backstage by one of his fellow band members. Emergency crews responded immediately and Colt was rushed to the hospital.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"<strong>I couldn't have been anymore on death's door. I died twice that day.</strong>"</p><cite><strong>Colt Ford</strong></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"When one of the top heart doctors in the world looks at you and goes 'You're 1% of 1%,' it can't get anymore dire than that," says Colt about his odds of surviving his heart attack.</p>



<p>Colt went into&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sudden-cardiac-arrest/symptoms-causes/syc-20350634">arrest</a>&amp;nbsp;twice.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart disease</a>&amp;nbsp;is the leading cause of death worldwide.

In the United States alone, it is estimated that every 40 seconds, someone has a heart attack.</p>



<p>Doctors often warn about the signs and symptoms of a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>,&amp;nbsp;such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain or pressure</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/shortness-of-breath/basics/causes/sym-20050890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shortness of breath</a>,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>. However, roughly 21% of heart attacks in the U.S. occur with minimal or even no symptoms, according to the American Heart Association. These&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"silent" heart attacks</a>&amp;nbsp;are known as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/myocardial-ischemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20375417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent ischemia</a>&amp;nbsp;or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/silent-heart-attack/faq-20057777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">silent myocardial infarction</a>.</p>



<p>Colt says he had recently undergone a regular check-up at a different medical center and got a clean bill of health.</p>



<p>"This is the unfortunate nature of heart attacks. It is possible to have tests which don't show&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockages</a>, but the nature of blockages is that they can behave unpredictably and suddenly occur," says Dr. Lee. "Despite our best efforts, on a populational level, heart attacks can still occur in patients out of the blue."</p>



<p>Nearly nine months after his heart attack, test results at Mayo Clinic indicate Colt is making excellent progress.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/fitness-basics/hlv-20049447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercise</a>&amp;nbsp;combined with a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-healthy-diet/art-20046702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart-healthy diet</a>&amp;nbsp;has helped him shed 60 pounds. "I'm about back to being in my college shape," says Colt, who played on the golf team for the University of Georgia before his singing career took off.</p>

<p>While his physical health improves, Colt admits the health scare has left him battling&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/panic-attacks/symptoms-causes/syc-20376021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">panic attacks</a>. "For me to say I'm having anxiety and panic attacks, that's even hard for me to say because I ain't scared of nothing," Colt says. "But I'm having to deal with that and share my feelings and all that kind of stuff. So, if you're feeling something, advocate for yourself. Don't just tough it out. Tell somebody."</p>



<p>Dr. Lee says it is not uncommon for patients to experience anxiety, panic attacks and even depression following a heart attack. He recommends patients maintain an open dialogue with their health care team and discuss any issues that arise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>"I'm back, baby!</strong>"</h2>



<p>Colt has been open about sharing his experience with his nearly three million followers on social media. "I'm back, baby!" Colt shared recently on Instagram. "It's been quite a journey but you guys have inspired me, you kept loving me, kept praying for me, kept sending me messages and I'm working hard to get better."</p>



<p>Just a year shy of his heart attack, Colt has released a new song and is embarking on a new tour. He is hoping his music and story will serve as inspiration for others. </p>

<p>Daylight Saving Time begins March 9 when clocks spring an hour forward early Sunday morning.</p>



<p>No matter if you need five hours of sleep or eight, the key is getting good, refreshing rest. According to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/somers-virend-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054093?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Virend Somers</a>, a cardiologist who specializes in sleep disorders, how much sleep a person needs varies from person to person.

<p>Different people need different amounts of sleep, and, on average, we can say most people need seven to eight hours," explains Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>He says to consider the quality of sleep, not the quantity. He offers these&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379">ideas&amp;nbsp;</a>to help you have good sleep hygiene.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Tips for better sleep</h2>



<p>"In the bedroom, you want absolute darkness," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a white woman sleeping peacefully in bed in a darkened room, with a soft light falling across her face" class="wp-image-364301" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/04/a-white-woman-sleeping-peacefully-in-bed-in-a-darkened-room-with-a-soft-light-falling-across-her-face-16X9.jpg 1500w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>And that means no screens, no TV, no laptops, no phones, and no ticking clocks or LED displays.</p>



<p>"Avoid bright lights, avoid looking at your phones because light from there can affect your&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-melatonin/art-20363071">melatonin</a>," Dr. Somers says. That's the hormone that regulates sleep.</p>



<p>He says when it comes to quality sleep, less stimulation is best.</p>



<p>"Minimize alcohol, minimize exercise, minimize lights, minimize external inputs before about two hours or so before bedtime. The bedroom is for sex and sleep. It's not for spreadsheets," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>Exercise can help improve sleep, but working out near bedtime can raise arousal levels, making it harder to sleep. And consider a sleep schedule. Going to bed and getting up at the same time each day reinforces your body's sleep-wake cycle.</p>

<p>The statistics are startling. One person dies every 33 seconds from cardiovascular disease in the U.S. High cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and hypertension can cause heart problems.</p>



<p>"African Americans, unfortunately, have the highest rates of uncontrolled hypertension in the world, which dramatically increases their risk for developing heart disease," says Dr. Brewer.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Black Americans are disproportionately impacted by cardiovascular disease</h3>



<p>She says elevated hypertension rates in the Black community can be attributed to various factors, including chronic stress, systemic racism and socioeconomic issues.</p>



<p>"That includes food insecurity, housing insecurity, redlining, which really limits certain individuals from receiving opportunities and resources to better their health," explains Dr. Brewer.</p>



<p>Dr. Brewer says simple lifestyle changes can reduce high blood pressure and heart disease, like eating healthier, getting regular physical activity and adequate sleep to reduce stress.</p>

<p>A new solution is transforming cardiac care by leveraging the power of artificial intelligence (AI) in point-of-care ultrasound. This innovation enables a wider range of medical professionals to capture high-quality cardiac images with confidence, ultimately enhancing diagnostic accuracy and improving clinical outcomes. Check out the latest episode of <a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodesix&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=global&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=190205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomorrow's Cure</a> to learn more.</p>



<p>The podcast episode features <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/friedman-paul-a-m-d/bio-20053442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Paul Friedman</a>, cardiologist and chair of Cardiovascular Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and <a href="https://ultrasight.com/our-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Davidi Vortman</a>, CEO of UltraSight. Together, Mayo Clinic and UltraSight are at the forefront of developing algorithms to analyze and interpret cardiac ultrasound images. The collaboration seeks to create a comprehensive solution to support diagnostic and treatment decisions using point-of-care ultrasound devices.</p>



<p>This AI-driven technology is designed to overcome existing barriers and expand access to high-quality cardiac imaging and diagnostics. UltraSight's innovation simplifies cardiac sonography by providing real-time guidance on maneuvering the ultrasound probe to capture high-quality images. Now, with the added power of AI, healthcare professionals can analyze those images more effectively.</p>



<p>"Historically, ultrasound has been somewhat difficult for an average person to get," says Dr. Friedman. "So, in many places around the world, if a physician orders an ultrasound of the heart, an echocardiogram, it may take several months to be scheduled."</p>



<p>"It hasn't been used for first-line screening because of those barriers. This is where some of the visionary work of a portable device that uses AI can turn that upside," he adds.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">

</div></figure>



<p>This innovative technology isn't about replacing experts, notes Vortman. "We're not replacing the experts, we are giving them more data from more patients, faster than ever before. So AI is an accelerator for access that gives much better data at the right time," he says.</p>



<p>"It doesn't replace human interpretation and action, but it can provide a common groundwork for consistency," Dr. Friedman adds.</p>



<p>Looking ahead, Vortman envisions a future where diagnostic tools are more accessible and affordable. "This is the future.

<p>Getting a good night's sleep can give you the energy to jump-start your day and your health.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Sleeping is very important to try to prevent other chronic conditions in the future, such as diabetes, heart attacks and strokes," says Dr. Cardenas Rosales.</p>

<p>"It's usually recommended for you to sleep at least seven hours per night in order to allow your body to recover to be ready for the following day," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Practical steps to help you get better sleep</strong></h2>



<p>"Try to sleep at the same time. Try to get a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and you're waking up also at the same time, that's very important," Dr. Cardenas Rosales says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Create good sleep habits</strong></h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep the time you go to bed and the time you wake up the same every day, including weekends.</li>



<li>Stay active. Regular activity can lead to a good night's sleep.</li>



<li>Limit naps or do not nap at all.</li>



<li>Limit or do not use caffeine, alcohol and nicotine.</li>



<li>Do not eat large meals or drink a lot of fluids before bed.</li>



<li>Make your bedroom comfortable.</li>



<li>Create a relaxing bedtime ritual, such as taking a warm bath, reading or listening to soft music.</li>
</ul>



<p>"You want to set up the environment to make it easier for your body to fall asleep," he says.</p>
