<p class="has-text-align-center has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-0a381724fd8a6321f7f32360329589e7" style="color:#4e526d"><em>(Video animation shows blood stem cells dividing and multiplying. Getty Images).</em></p>



<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Deep inside the body, a slow-growing cluster of mutated blood cells can form. This cluster, found in 1 in 5 older adults, can raise the risk of leukemia and heart disease, often without warning.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To better understand this hidden risk, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to help investigators uncover how it contributes to disease risk and progression. </p>



<p>In a study <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fgpb%2Fadvance-article%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fgpbjnl%2Fqzaf040%2F8121950&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CMurphy.Susan%40mayo.edu%7C05f57239f813422ca87008ddc97a7be3%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638888250101337358%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=EEqrric0Eslg1ajqpP60TW69EXgCPyIzcLJp5GRxa4Q%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0">published</a> in Genomics, Proteomics &amp;amp; Bioinformatics, the tool showed promising results in identifying early signs of this condition, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/clonal-hematopoiesis-clinic-stratifies-risk-for-patients-with-cancer/mac-20543180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential</a>, or CHIP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When blood cells mutate</strong></h2>



<p>CHIP starts in the bone marrow, where blood stem cells make the cells that keep organs working, oxygen flowing and the immune system strong. But if one of those cells acquires a mutation in a gene linked to blood cancer, it can multiply abnormally, forming a cluster of mutated cells that gradually expands.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This can cause CHIP, a condition with no symptoms that researchers link to higher rates of death, especially from heart disease. Because its effects vary, CHIP is hard to track and often goes undetected for years.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>CHIP makes leukemia more than 10 times more likely and raises the risk of heart disease up to four times, even in healthy adults. Finding it earlier could help guide proactive monitoring or preventive care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new tool for early detection</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new tool, called UNISOM — short for UNIfied SOmatic calling and Machine learning — was developed by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tian-shulan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20524328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shulan Tian, Ph.D.</a>, under the leadership of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, co-senior author of the study and the Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director of Research and Innovation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>UNISOM helps clinicians identify CHIP-related mutations in standard genetic datasets, opening new avenues for research and discovery. In the past, that level of detection required more complex and advanced sequencing methods.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Detecting disease at its earliest molecular roots is one of the most meaningful advances we can make in medicine," says Dr. Klee. "UNISOM is just one of many examples of how we're translating genomic science into innovative tools that support timely and informed care."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>UNISOM helped researchers detect nearly 80% of CHIP mutations using whole-exome sequencing, which analyzes the protein-coding regions of DNA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also tested UNISOM on whole-genome sequencing data from the Mayo Clinic Biobank, which captures nearly all of a person's genetic code. In that data, it detected early signs of CHIP, including mutations present in fewer than 5% of blood cells. Standard techniques often miss these small but important changes.</p>



<p>"We're engineering a path from genomic discovery to clinical decision-making," says Dr. Tian, the co-senior author and a bioinformatician at Mayo Clinic. "It's rewarding to help bring these discoveries closer to clinical care, where they can inform decisions and support more precise treatment."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to apply UNISOM to larger and more diverse datasets to support research and expand its use in clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>After more than 22 months at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's</a>, 13-year-old Ava Weitl went home to Iowa. She and her family were met with tears and cheers as dozens of members from her care team, who are now considered friends of the family, said goodbye and wished her well.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a day Ava had been looking forward to after a long journey with heart failure, two lifesaving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ecmo/about/pac-20484615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</a> therapies, a heart transplant, kidney failure and a kidney transplant.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Born with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)</a>, a life-threatening condition where the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped, Ava faced three open-heart surgeries before she would reach her 5th birthday. Within 90 minutes of her birth, her first surgery was performed. Her second surgery was completed months later, but the third, typically required for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-qa-podcast-hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLHS</a> patients between the ages of 3 and 4, was not possible due to other medical concerns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For a handful of years, Ava's care team monitored her to see what her body would do. During that time, Ava felt good and was "defying the odds," as her mom, Christina DeShaw, would say.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>It was in 2021, during third grade, when Ava began to show signs of her heart and lungs struggling. While cardiac catheterization improved the blood flow to her lungs, it was a temporary improvement, and by early 2023, doctors determined a heart transplant was her only option.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Officially listed for a heart transplant in February 2023, Ava's condition worsened, leading to hospitalization at Mayo Clinic in September 2023. That hospital stay was the start of her long journey of constant monitoring and tests, and it wasn’t easy on her family as they navigated life split between Minnesota and Iowa.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ava's condition took a critical turn. Ava was placed on life-sustaining ECMO, which provides heart and lung support when those organs are failing. Then, Feb. 26, 2024, the call came: a donor heart became available. The surgery was successful, but postoperative challenges arose.</p>



<p>Weeks later, complications with her lungs led to a return to ECMO for three months. She also needed a tracheostomy placed. While trying to save her lungs, her kidney function began to fail, leading to another gift of life — a kidney transplant on Jan. 25, 2025, thanks to a donation from her uncle through a kidney exchange with the National Kidney Registry.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"She's a walking miracle," her mother says. "We can't even wrap our heads around what she's been through."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — An artificial intelligence (AI) model developed by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://www.ultromics.com/about/about-ultromics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultromics, Ltd.</a>, an AI echocardiography company based in Oxford, England, is highly accurate in screening for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiac-amyloidosis-clinic/overview/ovc-20508423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac amyloidosis</a>, a rare and progressive type of heart failure, according to a new study. The model is the first and only AI tool of its kind.</p>



<p>Researchers from Mayo Clinic and Ultromics, with investigators at the University of Chicago Medicine and collaborators around the world, validated and tested the model on a large and multiethnic patient population and compared its abilities to other diagnostic methods for cardiac amyloidosis.</p>



<p>Their findings, published in the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaf387" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Heart Journal</a>, show that the AI model was highly accurate, with 85% sensitivity (correctly identifying those with the disease) and 93% specificity (correctly identifying those without the disease). Using a single echocardiography videoclip, the model was effective across all major types of cardiac amyloidosis and distinguished it from other conditions with similar characteristics.</p>



<p>Cardiac amyloidosis is a life-threatening condition where an abnormal protein, called amyloid, builds up in the heart, causing it to stiffen and not work properly. It is often missed because the symptoms and imaging features can be similar to other heart conditions. However, early diagnosis is crucial because new drug therapies are now available that can slow or stop the disease's progression.</p>



<p>This work builds on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772963X23003125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous experience</a> of Mayo Clinic and Ultromics in developing an AI echocardiography model to detect <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cardiovascular-diseases/news/heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction-hfpef-more-than-diastolic-dysfunction/mac-20430055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF)</a>, which received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance in 2022. HFpEF is a common type of heart failure, associated with high morbidity and mortality, but can be challenging to diagnose. An estimated 15% of patients with HFpEF have cardiac amyloidosis.</p>

<p>"This AI model is a breakthrough tool that can help us identify patients earlier so they can receive the treatment they need," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pellikka-patricia-a-m-d/bio-00077298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patricia Pellikka, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and past director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/echocardiography-laboratory/overview/ovc-20442326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Echocardiography Lab</a> in Rochester. "We found that AI performed better than traditional clinical and transthoracic echo-based screening methods, providing clinicians with stronger insights on which to base decisions for further confirmation tests. New treatments are available for cardiac amyloidosis but are most effective if administered early in the course of the disease." Dr. Pellikka is senior author of the study.</p>



<p>The amyloid AI model is FDA-cleared and is currently being used at multiple centers in the U.S. Dr. Pellikka says she looks forward to applying this technology in the clinical practice at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>Sue Baker started having issues with her heart in 2015. By 2019, she began experiencing heart failure. Living in Southeast Georgia, her condition landed her in the hospital seven times before the last visit led to her being transferred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, nearly 90 minutes away, critically ill.</p>



<p>"She was really sick — in cardiogenic shock, intubated, connected to a breathing machine — she was not going to make it," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/patel-parag-c-m-d/bio-20055567">Dr. Parag Patel</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant cardiologist. "She only had three to six months to live, and we needed to act fast."</p>

<p>Sue's situation had become dire. She was presented with two options: enter hospice care or have a left <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-assist-device/about/pac-20384529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular assist device (LVAD)</a> implanted to serve as a bridge to a heart transplant. While she chose the LVAD to buy more time, by 2023 she was experiencing dangerous heart rhythms and other challenges.</p>



<p>Complicating matters, her body was producing more antibodies, making it increasingly difficult to find a suitable transplant donor.</p>



<p>"It was devastating to know that I'm actually going to die," says Sue. Still, she did not lose hope. "You just grab hold of God and keep praying," she says.</p>



<p>Sue's care team also remained determined to help her hold on. They explored an innovative approach — called Heart After Liver Transplant with a Domino Liver to another patient (HALT-D) — that had shown success in patients with similar antibody counts.</p>



<p>HALT-D, however, had never been attempted on someone with a heart pump like hers. This procedure would be a first for Mayo Clinic, at any of its transplant sites.</p>



<p>Although Sue's liver was healthy, she would need to get not just a heart transplant but also a donor liver to help remove the antibodies from her body and reduce the risk of her new heart being rejected. This meant a rare and complex domino transplant, involving both a liver and a heart, where Sue's liver would also become part of the donor chain.</p>



<p>"We take the liver of the patient who's receiving the heart after liver, and we take that liver and we put it into another recipient so that we do not waste an organ," says Patel.</p>



<p>Preparing for this complex procedure involved extensive multidisciplinary collaboration between a variety of Mayo Clinic departments. Sue spent months in the hospital, waiting for a match. During her wait, fellow patients and staff began calling her "mama" for the care and support she provided everyone else, despite her own challenges.</p>



<p>"We get to know each other and kind of help each other out," says Sue. "That was a lot of healing and helpfulness there."</p>

<p>"Sue not only helped people on the floor, but she's helped other patients who didn't have an opportunity" for transplant, says Patel.</p>



<p>Finally, in September 2024, the domino transplant was performed successfully.</p>



<p>Today, Sue is on the path to recovery, growing stronger each day. Her motivation to live is fueled by the desire to honor her donor, whose gift has given her a second chance at life.</p>



<p>"I would love to thank and meet the family," says Sue. "I'm not going to sit back and do nothing. That person will always be special."</p>



<p>Her story is a testament to the power of medical innovation, the dedication of healthcare professionals, and the resilience of the human spirit.</p>



<p>"I love her, and I appreciate the doctors and all the nurses that have been so loving and caring for Sue,” says Charlene Taylor, Sue's caretaker.</p>

<p><em>Mayo Clinic Healthcare cardiologist offers simple tips to maximize health at outdoor events </em><strong></strong></p>



<p>LONDON — Festival season can be surprisingly physically demanding. Hours spent standing, walking or dancing can put extra strain on the heart, especially for those with preexisting conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>, explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/doctors/gosia-wamil-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gosia Wamil, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare</a>&nbsp;in London.<br><br>For people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/heart-failure-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>, this can lead to shortness of breath or a worsening of symptoms. For those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/coronary-artery-disease-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>, in which the major vessels that supply blood to your heart become narrowed or blocked, sudden intense activity can trigger <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chest-pain/symptoms-causes/syc-20370838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chest pain</a> or even a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>, Dr. Wamil says.</p>



<p>"Key warning signs of heart distress at festivals include chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, cold sweats, or fainting," Dr. Wamil adds. "These symptoms should never be ignored, and immediate medical help should be sought if they occur."<br><br>Noise exposure at outdoor concerts, carnivals and other events also can affect heart health.</p>



<p>"Short-term, loud noise can trigger the body's 'fight or flight' response, raising blood pressure and heart rate," Dr. Wamil says. "Long-term, chronic noise exposure has been shown to increase the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease."</p>



<p>Overindulging in alcohol, caffeine or salty food poses another serious risk. It can trigger <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-recognizing-holiday-heart-2/#:~:text=The%20holiday%20season%20is%20a%20time%20of%20celebration,called%20%22holiday%20heart%22%20that%20can%20have%20significant%20consequences." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holiday heart syndrome</a>, in which even healthy individuals develop an irregular heartbeat, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atrial-fibrillation/symptoms-causes/syc-20350624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>, Dr. Wamil says.</p>



<p>"Alcohol is a direct toxin to the heart muscle and can cause a sudden rise in blood pressure," she explains. "For those with existing heart conditions, binge drinking can trigger heart failure or even a heart attack."</p>



<p>People with diabetes or heart disease should plan ahead when attending festivals and other events, advises Dr. Wamil, who specializes in <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-healthcare-cardiologist-explains-link-between-diabetes-heart-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the link</a> between diabetes and heart disease. It's important to take medications on time, bring medical identification and carry essential supplies, such as snacks, water and a list of medications.</p>



<p>Keeping blood sugar stable with healthy food choices and staying hydrated can help prevent complications. Comfortable shoes and regular rest breaks are also key, especially for those with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-neuropathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20352061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neuropathy</a> or fatigue.</p>



<p>"If you have a heart condition or other serious medical issue, staying near the edge of crowds is a sensible precaution. It allows quicker access to medical help and an easier way out if needed," Dr. Wamil suggests. "Crowded environments can lead to overheating, anxiety or unexpected physical exertion, so choosing a shaded, quieter area can reduce risk."</p>



<p>For everyone, staying healthy during festival season means <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hydrating</a> often, especially with water, and seeking out shade on <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heat-stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20353581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot days</a>.</p>



<p>"Try to balance fun with rest, and include healthy foods when possible," Dr. Wamil says. "Protect yourself from the <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/08/29/top-10-myths-about-sunscreen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sun</a>, pace your activities, and keep your phone charged in case of emergencies."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>When I go for a walk or to the gym, people always seem to be checking their pulse, whether by hand or with a wearable. Why is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/your-wearable-says-your-heart-rate-variability-has-changed-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart rate </a>so important?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Your heart rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Your resting heart rate is when the heart is pumping the lowest amount of blood you need because you're not exercising. If you're sitting or lying down ― and you're calm, relaxed and aren't sick ― your heart rate is typically between 60 and 100 beats per minute.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Other factors that can affect your heart rate include:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Air temperature</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>When&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/effects-of-high-temperatures-on-blood-pressure-heart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temperatures or humidity increases</a>, the heart pumps more blood, so your pulse or heart rate may increase.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Body position</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>Sometimes, when going from sitting to standing, your pulse may go up a little. After a few minutes, it should return to a typical rate.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Emotions</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>If you're stressed, anxious or incredibly happy, your emotions can raise your heart rate.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Body size</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>Body size usually doesn’t increase your heart rate. However, if you're obese, you may have a higher resting heart rate.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Medication use</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>Medications that block adrenaline tend to slow your heart rate. Thyroid medication may raise it.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why your heart rate matters</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Cardiovascular exercise, also called cardio or aerobic exercise, keeps you and your heart healthy. This specific type of exercise gets your heart rate up and your heart beating faster for several minutes. Cardiovascular exercise helps strengthen your heart, allowing it to pump blood more efficiently and improving blood flow to all parts of your body. It also boosts your high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good"&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/know-your-numbers-cholesterol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a>, and lowers your low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad" cholesterol. This may result in less buildup of plaque in your arteries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Abnormal heart rate</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>If you experience irregular heartbeats, including a racing heartbeat, slow heartbeat or a feeling of fluttering in your chest, you may be experiencing a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/racing-heart-beat-heart-arrhythmia-101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart arrhythmia</a>. Heart rhythm or heartbeat problems can occur when the electrical impulses that coordinate your heartbeats don't work properly, causing your heart to beat too fast, slow or irregularly. Talk with your healthcare team if you have heart rhythm concerns.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Know your numbers</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Many wearable activity trackers can&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/how-to-take-pulse/art-20482581" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monitor your heart rate</a>&amp;nbsp;when you exercise and periodically throughout the day. If you don't have an activity tracker, you can use the radial artery in your wrist or the carotid artery in your neck. If you have heart disease or long-standing diabetes, it's best to use the artery on your wrist.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To find your heart rate manually:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Locate the artery you will use to find your heart rate.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Using the tips of your first two fingers, press lightly over the artery.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Count your heartbeats for 30 seconds and multiply by 2 to find your total beats per minute.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What's your target heart rate?</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Your target heart rate is the rate you need to maintain over a set amount of time to reach the energy level necessary to give your heart a good workout. The first step in finding the target heart rate that will maximize your cardiovascular exercise is determining your maximum heart rate.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Your maximum heart rate is 220 minus your age. Your target heart rate for moderate to vigorous exercise is about 50%–85% of your maximum heart rate.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>A general guide for averages by age is:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>20: 100–170 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>30: 95–162 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>35: 93–157 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>40: 90–153 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>45: 88–149 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>50: 85–145 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>55: 83–140 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>60: 80–136 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>65: 78–132 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>70: 75–128 beats per minute&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to give your heart a good workout</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Start slowly.</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>If you’re beginning an exercise program, aim for the lower end of your target heart rate zone, and then gradually build up intensity.&amp;nbsp;If your heart rate is too high, take it easier. If it's too low, add some intensity and push yourself to get your heart rate closer to your target.</p>



<p><strong>Try interval training.</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/interval-training-for-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Interval training</a>, which includes short bursts of 15–60 seconds of higher-intensity exercise, alternated with longer, less strenuous exercise, effectively increases cardiovascular fitness. Talk with your healthcare team before trying interval training, but it’s typically safe for those with existing heart disease and type 2 diabetes.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Take the "talk test."</strong>&amp;nbsp;<br>If you can carry on a conversation in brief sentences while exercising, you're probably in the moderate intensity range. You'll be breathing faster, developing a light sweat and feeling some muscle strain. If you're working at a vigorous intensity, you won't be able to say more than a few words without catching your breath. If you can sing while working out, you're probably in the low-intensity range, so step it up.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I've been diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-managing-atrial-fibrillation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">atrial fibrillation</a>. I've read that it puts me at greater risk of stroke. Can you tell me more about this?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>You may not have known you had atrial fibrillation (AFib) until your condition was discovered during a physical examination. For others, AFib can have life-altering symptoms that affect their ability to perform daily activities.</p>



<p>Atrial fibrillation&nbsp;is a common type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/is-it-love-or-atrial-fibrillation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart rhythm disorder </a>where the heart doesn't beat efficiently. This makes the heart unable to pump enough blood out to the body with each heartbeat. It’s estimated 12.1 million people in the U.S. will be diagnosed with AFib by 2030.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/12/Atrial-fibrillation-Mayo-16-x-9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Atrial fibrillation can lead to the development of blood clots in the heart that can break off, travel to and block arteries supplying the brain with blood.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lowering stroke risk</strong></h2>



<p>People with AFib are at a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/who-is-most-at-risk-for-a-stroke" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">higher risk of stroke</a>&nbsp;— about 1 in 7 strokes are AFib related — due to clots that can form in the upper chambers of the heart. Of the strokes resulting from atrial fibrillation, 90% occur from clots originating in the left atrial appendage in the left atrium of the heart.</p>



<p>Key risk factors for stroke in people with atrial fibrillation include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Age</li>



<li>Gender</li>



<li>High blood pressure</li>



<li>Prior history of stroke</li>



<li>Chronic health conditions, including congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease and diabetes</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating AFib</strong></h2>



<p>There are three main approaches to treating AFib. These are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Medical therapy for maintaining normal rhythm and preventing clots.</li>



<li>Therapy to reset the heart rhythm, called cardioversion.</li>



<li>Procedures to obtain and maintain normal heart rhythm.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Medications.</strong></p>



<p>Medications for treating AFib are the front line for managing symptoms and preventing stroke. These medicines can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Prevent blood clots.</li>



<li>Control the speed of the heartbeat.</li>



<li>Restore the heart rhythm.</li>
</ul>



<p>This group of medications includes beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, arrhythmics and anticoagulants. Your cardiology team will work together to determine which medication will work best for you.</p>



<p><strong>Cardioversion.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cardioversion/about/pac-20385123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardioversion</a>&nbsp;is usually done in a hospital as a scheduled procedure. Patients may still need to take medicines for the rest of their lives to control their heart rhythm and prevent future episodes of atrial fibrillation. Even with medicine,&nbsp;AFib&nbsp;could return.</p>



<p><strong>Procedural options.</strong></p>



<p>People who are candidates for procedural options are cared for by a team of cardiologists, including cardiac electrophysiologists and additional specialists as needed. Potential procedures include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Left atrial appendage occlusion.&nbsp;</strong>The left atrial occlusion is a pouch-like extension of the heart. A minimally invasive procedure provides an alternative to long-term blood-thinner medications. It involves implanting a device, via a catheter, to close and seal off the left atrial appendage. This decreases the risk of blood clots entering the bloodstream, traveling to the brain or other body organs, and causing a stroke or organ damage. Patients typically leave the hospital the same day or the next day.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ablation.&nbsp;</strong>Ablation stops the generation of abnormal electrical signals in the heart and keeps it in normal, or sinus, rhythm. During ablation, a catheter is fed into the heart through the groin area using a minimally invasive approach and delivers heat or cold to modify the tissues in the heart that are causing the arrhythmia.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Pulsed field ablation (PFA).&nbsp;</strong>PFA stands out from traditional atrial fibrillation (AFib) treatments due to its precision and safety. Unlike radiofrequency or cryoablation, which use heat or cold to destroy heart tissue, PFA uses short electrical pulses to target the myocardium, minimizing damage to the esophagus and nerves.</li>
</ul>



<p>Benefits to patients include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Reduced procedure and anesthesia time</li>



<li>Quicker recovery time</li>



<li>Surrounding tissue protection</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hybrid ablation.&nbsp;</strong>For people who have long-standing, persistent atrial fibrillation, ablation alone is successful half of the time. Hybrid ablation is an option for people with atrial fibrillation that's hard to manage or who have been in atrial fibrillation for more than a year. It combines the best of the catheter lab ablation and an open surgical approach.</li>
</ul>



<p>The procedure is done in two parts:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Part one is performed by surgeons with a scope inserted through a small incision under the breastbone to ablate the back side of the heart, followed by closure of the left atrial appendage.</li>



<li>During part two, a catheter ablation modifies the tissues on the inside of the heart.</li>
</ul>



<p>This whole-heart approach allows patients to return to normal rhythm with excellent results.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new discovery by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers could mean more donor hearts are available for heart transplant, giving more people a second chance at life.</p>



<p>In findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00653-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Nature Cardiovascular Research, a team led by Mayo Clinic cardiac surgeon <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tang-paul-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20554335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Tang, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, identified a biological process that contributes to donor heart injury during cold storage. The researchers found that a drug already used to treat heart conditions can prevent this damage.</p>



<p>Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage heart failure, yet fewer than half of donor hearts are ultimately used. One major reason is the relatively short window for transplanting a donated heart into a patient, due to concerns over low donor heart function that comes from leaving a heart in cold storage too long. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why donor hearts deteriorate in cold storage</strong></h2>



<p>Although cold storage slows metabolism and helps preserve tissue, prolonged exposure to cold storage conditions can lead to molecular changes that compromise how well the heart performs after transplant. One complication is called primary graft dysfunction, in which the transplanted heart cannot pump blood effectively after surgery. This may affect up to 20% of recipients to varying degrees.</p>



<p>To investigate why this damage occurs, the researchers focused on a protein inside heart cells called the mineralocorticoid receptor, which plays a role in how cells respond to stress. During cold storage, they found that this protein undergoes a process in which the protein clumps together in a way that harms the heart cells, called liquid-liquid phase separation. This process promotes cardiac damage from increased inflammation and cell death, making the heart less likely to function well after transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing damage with a common drug</strong></h2>



<p>To test whether the process could be prevented, the researchers treated donor hearts with a drug called canrenone, which blocks mineralocorticoid receptor activity. In human donor hearts stored beyond the typical timeframe, treatment with the drug nearly tripled their pumping strength compared to hearts stored without it. The hearts also showed better blood flow and fewer signs of cell injury. The findings suggest canrenone may help extend the safe storage period for donor hearts by improving the heart’s pumping strength to increase chances of a successful transplant.</p>



<p>"As a cardiovascular surgeon, I’ve personally experienced in the operating room how every additional hour of preservation can impact the likelihood of whether a donor heart can return to normal function after transplantation," Dr. Tang says. "This discovery may give us a new tool to preserve heart function for longer during storage, improve transplant outcomes and enhance patient access to lifesaving transplants."</p>



<p>The study's findings also have the potential to improve the preservation of other transplantable organs. Similar protein clustering was observed in donor kidneys, lungs and livers during cold storage. This suggests that the same strategy may help expand transplant options across multiple organ systems.</p>

<p>Preventing a stroke is a crucial aspect of healthcare, as about 80% of all strokes are preventable. The focus is on managing risk factors to reduce the long-term risk of stroke.</p>



<p>A stroke results from a blocked or torn blood vessel that decreases blood flow to the brain. In the U.S., stroke is a leading cause of death and disability.</p>



<p>“Because about 80% of all strokes are preventable, we really focus on prevention,” says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/english-stephen-w-jr-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20491968?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stephen English</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/home/orc-20117057?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurologist</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing stroke risks</h2>



<p>Tips for lowering stroke risk include maintaining blood pressure under 130/80 and keeping cholesterol and blood glucose at appropriate levels.</p>



<p>"(Other modifiable risks include) things like smoking cessation, treatment of sleep apnea with a CPAP device, and some other potential treatments," he says. "We want to make sure that the risk factors are mitigated to help reduce the long-term risk of stroke."</p>



<p>There are risk factors for stroke that cannot be changed. These include age, sex, race and family history. “There are four nonmodifiable risk factors we typically think about. The first is age, so age greater than 55; males; people that have a family history of prior stroke; and then people that are of African American descent,” says Dr. English.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;My husband and son are constantly coming home with an energy drink in hand. I tell them that they are bad for you, but I don't know enough to make a strong case. What are the effects of energy drinks on the body?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Energy drinks are a multibillion-dollar industry and are the most consumed supplement not under the control of the&amp;nbsp;Food and Drug Administration&amp;nbsp;other than multivitamins. It's a bit like the "Wild West" in the sense that energy drinks and their stimulating ingredients are under no FDA regulation and are not classified as a food or a drug but as a supplement.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Energy drinks contain ingredients such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20049372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caffeine</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/taurine/faq-20058177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taurine</a>&nbsp;and guarana that affect the heart, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pacemaker/multimedia/the-conduction-system/img-20008516#:~:text=The%20heart's%20conduction%20system%20also,called%20the%20heart's%20natural%20pacemaker." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart's electrical system</a> and the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/aortic-valve-repair-aortic-valve-replacement/multimedia/img-20305790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart's muscular pump</a>. When our bodies react to these chemicals, the heart rate and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>&nbsp;can change. The heart's recharging of the electrical system can be affected by these chemicals. For most people with a healthy heart, the consumption of an energy drink would have no serious impact on our health. However, if you have a genetic heart condition that predisposes you to sudden cardiac death, exposure to an energy drink may not be as harmless.&nbsp;</p>



<p>People with underlying genetic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118#:~:text=Less%2Dserious%20congenital%20heart%20defects,tiring%20during%20exercise%20or%20activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>&amp;nbsp;or adults with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>&amp;nbsp;or weaker heart pumps can be more vulnerable to the chemicals in energy drinks. About one in 200 people have a sudden death-predisposing genetic heart disease, including&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/long-qt-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20352518" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long QT syndrome</a>, arrhythmogenic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cardiomyopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20370709" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiomyopathy</a>&amp;nbsp;and catecholaminergic polymorphic&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ventricular-tachycardia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular tachycardia</a>.&amp;nbsp;A healthy&amp;nbsp;heart can handle caffeine in moderation, but a fragile heart may not be able to.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Consuming up to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678#:~:text=Up%20to%20400%20milligrams%20(mg,widely%2C%20especially%20among%20energy%20drinks." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">400 mg of caffeine</a>&amp;nbsp;a day is safe for most adults — some energy drinks contain over half this amount in a single can. Depending on the age of your son, he may need to stay under 100 mg of caffeine per day, which is the recommended amount for adolescents ages 12-18.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to heart risk, studies have suggested an increased risk of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113">stroke</a>&amp;nbsp;with energy drink consumption. Long-term exposure to these substances over time affects how the blood vessels and heart react to the chemicals. Our blood vessels that control our blood pressure are reacting to these chemicals, and the potential reason behind stroke risk is the tightening of our blood vessels.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For the 199 out of 200 people who have a healthy heart and who do not have a genetic heart disease, energy drink consumption in moderation is safe. However, you might want to ask yourself: Can you go three days without it? If not, you may be experiencing some dependency on the chemicals in the energy drink. Heavy&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/caffeine-oral-route/side-effects/drg-20137844">caffeine</a>&amp;nbsp;consumption can cause physical and psychological dependence, restlessness and insomnia.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, there is very little health value to energy drinks. Listen to your body — Are they making you feel shaky or causing you to experience withdrawals? Can you be satisfied with your morning&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/coffee-and-health/faq-20058339">coffee</a>&amp;nbsp;or tea instead?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There is a lot of room for future research on these beverages. Consuming the wrong thing at the wrong time in the wrong person is a setup for the perfect storm. Caffeine may also interact with a person's medications.
