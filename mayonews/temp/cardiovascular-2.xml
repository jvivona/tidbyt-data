<p><strong><em>With a failing heart and little hope of healing, Alan Lewis sunk into depression, gaining 330 pounds. After he came to Mayo, bariatric surgery enabled the transplant he'd sought for so many years. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Alan Lewis was lying on the floor — the only position that eased his discomfort — watching a football game. When a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> commercial came on, the tagline seemed to leap off the screen.</p>



<p>"You know where to go."</p>



<p>With heart failure sapping his strength, Alan had begun to doubt there was an "other side" to his condition. At age 41, he'd already lived a decade with a poorly pumping heart, diagnosed during a hospital visit for a broken ankle.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, Alan had relied on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-assist-device/about/pac-20384529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left ventricular assist device</a>, or LVAD, to help his heart circulate blood through his body. After the first one malfunctioned, he received a second device in 2018.</p>



<p>What Alan really needed was a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/heart-transplant/sections/overview/ovc-20212168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new heart.</a></p>



<p>Even after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/about/pac-20394258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a> helped him lose weight, he still wasn't added to the transplant list. "When we'd ask about transplant, our care team would just say, 'Oh, he's doing fine. Just keep doing what you're doing,'" says his wife, Vida.</p>



<p>As months became years, Alan's hope of healing waned. His mental health spiraled.</p>



<p>"I was a nervous wreck," he recalls. "What if the LVAD malfunctioned? What if there was a power failure? I was scared to go places, worried about backup batteries. I was in my head 24/7. It was torture."</p>



<p>Deeply depressed, Alan gained 330 pounds during the pandemic, reversing his previous weight loss. Without a clear path forward, he resigned himself to dying.</p>



<p>Then, in 2022, Alan saw the Mayo commercial — and Vida saw an opportunity. She made the decision for them. They were going to Rochester.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A journey toward hope</strong></h2>



<p>After driving from Chicago, weak and rapidly declining, Alan sought help from Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>There, Vida's long-simmering concern was confirmed —a tough-to-kill bacteria had infected the wiring that linked his LVAD to its external battery. The battery for his defibrillator was also dead, leaving him vulnerable to potentially deadly arrhythmias.</p>



<p>Right away, Alan received IV antibiotics, a new defibrillator and an introduction to the transplant team. "Day one, they spoke of transplant," says Vida. "I was shocked."</p>



<p>At his first follow-up visit, Sarah Schettle, a physician assistant on the LVAD team, could see the emotional strain of all that Alan and Vida had been through. "There was a lot of hesitancy — 'Will Mayo accept us?'" she recalls. "I also remember the hopefulness, the desire to know what was possible here."</p>



<p>Recognizing that Alan needed complex, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/multidisciplinary-team-approach/gnc-20203912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multidisciplinary care</a>, the team began formulating a plan.</p>



<p>Within two weeks, the couple relocated to Rochester — and just one year into marriage, Vida unflinchingly pivoted to her new role as caregiver.</p>



<p>"It was embedded in me to love as hard and as much as you can," she says.</p>



<p>Vida vowed to do that for Alan.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Alan and Vida Lewis" class="wp-image-410481" style="width:644px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Throughout Alan's journey, his wife, Vida, advocated for his care.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preparing for tomorrow</strong></h2>



<p>The team said Alan needed to adopt a healthier lifestyle before a second bariatric surgery — a necessary step toward transplant. So Vida signed them up for a gym. She walked next to him on a treadmill, urging him on. She made healthy meals. She pored over the lengthy care plan, still shocked that they had one. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Back home, no one gave us clear answers. How long would he have the LVAD? Could he ever get a transplant?" she says. "At Mayo, we never experienced that. The focus was always on getting him well enough for a transplant, like he deserved to be transplanted."</p>



<p>Still, there was fear that the new heart wouldn’t happen. Sensing Alan's struggle, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/da-silva-de-abreu-adrian-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20540178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adrian da Silva de Abreu, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, one of his cardiologists, spent an hour at his bedside, mostly listening.</p>



<p>"I'd never seen a doctor take that time," says Alan. "I put it all out there, and I could tell he was hearing me."</p>



<p>Peace replaced his once-crippling anxiety. At last, he knew his team wanted what was best for him. As Vida says, "They had a vision. They had a plan. It was healthcare like I've never seen before."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A risk with great reward</strong></h2>



<p>Alan's first bariatric surgery shrunk his stomach to the size of a banana.</p>



<p>To help him lose the weight he'd regained, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ghanem-omar-m-m-d/bio-20491179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omar Ghanem, M.D.</a>, a bariatric surgeon, planned to reroute part of Alan's small intestine so food would bypass a long segment of his bowel. Known as a modified duodenal switch, this would reduce how many calories and nutrients he absorbed and alter the secretion of hunger-related hormones.</p>



<p>Dr. Ghanem knew the already complex surgery would be even more challenging in Alan's case. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>With his heart essentially outside his body, monitoring — and maintaining — his vitals would be difficult. Blood thinners to prevent clots in his LVAD would also elevate his risk of bleeding. Then there was the looming infection, suppressed but still active, only curable if the LVAD was removed. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Seven Mayo Clinic teams — from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/infectious-diseases/sections/overview/ovc-20456906" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infectious Diseases</a> to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/anesthesiology-and-perioperative-medicine/home/orc-20507831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anesthesiology</a> —&nbsp;worked together to help Alan beat the odds.</p>



<p>"Where else do you have all this expertise in one place? I don't think anything like this can be done outside of a place like Mayo," says Dr. Ghanem. "Here we're able to safely push the limits."</p>



<p>Knowing this path was his best chance at healing, Alan and Vida agreed to go forward.</p>



<p>Despite its complexity, the revision was a success, and so was the recovery.&amp;nbsp;Within months, Alan lost enough weight to qualify for a heart. He was finally on the transplant list. &amp;nbsp;</p>

</div>


<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moving forward at last</strong></h2>



<p>Six weeks later, a middle-of-the-night call brought Alan back to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>After years of heart failure, two LVADs, two bariatric surgeries, dozens of pounds lost and hundreds of tears shed, Alan was receiving another chance at life. He was receiving a new heart.</p>



<p>Less than five hours after opening his chest, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/spencer-philip-j-m-d/bio-20527536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philip Spencer, M.D.</a>, a cardiovascular and transplant surgeon, brought Alan to the "other side" of heart failure — that place he'd once thought didn't exist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"We had an infection to deal with. And there was scarring within his chest," says Dr. Spencer. "But, once the LVAD was out, it went very well." &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>IV steroids enabled his body to accept the organ, and with the LVAD out, his infection could finally clear. Even from his hospital bed, Alan felt his confidence returning.</p>



<p>"I'd had this yoke on me. I couldn't move without the LVAD. I couldn't bathe without it. I couldn't eat without it. It was always present," he says. "Mentally, I'd been down so long. Now I had freedom."</p>



<p>For the first time in years, there were no wires to wrestle with. There was no battery to worry about.</p>



<p>Alan could be himself again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new life for Alan</strong></h2>



<p>With Alan's heart fully functioning, the couple is now back in Chicago, enjoying a renewed zeal for life.</p>



<p>For Alan, that means showing his gratitude for everyone who supported him — his family, his close friends and, of course, Vida. Every day, he focuses on caring for her in every way possible. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"When I wake up, I start catering to her," he says. "She had to cook and clean. She helped bathe me and put on my shoes and socks. It's a joy for me to be able to do things for her now."</p>



<p>During the night, Alan sometimes reaches across the mattress, making sure Vida is still there, even though he knows she always will be. She is his safe person, and Mayo Clinic is the safe place that showed him what healthcare should be.</p>



<p>Both their hearts remain in Minnesota, where hope first began to beat, strong and steady, in Alan's chest. The tagline from a football game ad — "You know where to go" — still feels like a summons.</p>



<p>"To have so many people involved in your care, and each one be a beautiful experience, is so rare," says Vida. "God has blessed him, and Mayo has been there for him. We want to move back because Rochester feels like home, you know?"</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I found out during my pregnancy that I have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/mitral-valve-stenosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mitral valve stenosis</a>. How common is valve disease, and what should I know about it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-valve-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve disease</a> affects how blood moves through the heart, and pregnancy is often a time when symptoms first appear or become more noticeable. Learning about a heart valve condition during pregnancy can be unexpected and overwhelming. Understanding why this happens and exploring treatment options can bring clarity and calm fears.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/pregnancy/art-20045977" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pregnancy</a> is often described as the body's ultimate cardiovascular stress test. The heart works significantly harder to support both the mother and the developing baby. Blood volume expands, vascular resistance drops and heart rate increases. These normal physiological changes begin early in pregnancy and peak in the late second to early third trimester.</p>



<p>These changes can unmask symptoms of previously silent valve disease or intensify those of known valve conditions because the heart is being asked to move more blood through a valve that isn't functioning normally. Known valve conditions include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Narrowed valves (stenosis)</li>



<li>Leaky valves (regurgitation)</li>



<li>Congenital valve abnormalities</li>
</ul>



<p>Other valve conditions may result from infections, such as rheumatic fever, or changes in the valve's structure over time.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>Even women who felt well before pregnancy may begin to notice symptoms around 28 to 30 weeks, when the cardiovascular system reaches its peak workload.</p>



<p>Many common pregnancy symptoms overlap with those of valve disease. Fatigue, shortness of breath, swelling and a faster heart rate can all occur in a healthy pregnancy. It's especially important to evaluate symptoms that begin suddenly or noticeably worsen.</p>



<p>Shortness of breath with activity or when lying flat, unusual fatigue that affects daily routines, swelling in the legs or feet, racing heartbeat, reduced exercise tolerance, or chest pressure should prompt a conversation with a clinician.</p>



<p>Because pregnancy symptoms can mask underlying cardiac issues, clear communication between patients and their care teams is essential. Many patients assume new symptoms are simply part of pregnancy, especially if previous pregnancies were uncomplicated. But when something feels off, listening to that instinct is important.</p>



<p>An assessment of symptoms may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Physical exam.</li>



<li>Echocardiogram to look at the heart's structure and function.</li>



<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the heart's rhythm.</li>



<li>Additional imaging or testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>These evaluations help determine whether symptoms are pregnancy-related or caused by cardiac disease.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment</h2>



<p>Once valve disease is identified, coordinated care becomes especially important. Many patients benefit from a pregnancy heart team approach that includes specialists in cardiology and maternal-fetal medicine, with support from cardiac surgery or structural heart experts, if needed. Local obstetric teams may remain involved, particularly if delivery is expected to happen closer to home.</p>



<p>The pregnancy heart team approach helps align medical needs with a patient's goals for pregnancy and family planning. Shared decision-making plays a central role. Every situation is different, and treatment choices are shaped by personal values, risk considerations and long-term planning.</p>



<p>Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and how well a patient tolerates the physiologic demands of pregnancy.</p>



<p>Many women with mild or moderate valve disease can continue pregnancy safely with close monitoring. Medications may be used to help manage fluid retention, control heart rate or reduce symptoms.</p>



<p>When valve disease is more severe or symptoms significantly affect daily life, procedures may be done before or during pregnancy. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Catheter-based procedures to widen a narrow valve or improve function.</li>



<li>Valve repair to preserve a person's own valve when possible.</li>



<li>Valve replacement when the disease is advanced or symptoms can't be controlled.</li>
</ul>



<p>For those who need valve replacement, care teams will discuss the choice between a mechanical or tissue valve, especially for women planning future pregnancies.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mechanical valves are durable but require lifelong anticoagulation, which can add complexity during pregnancy.</li>



<li>Tissue valves typically avoid long-term blood thinners but have a shorter lifespan.</li>
</ul>



<p>Treatment choices can shape both personal health and a family's future. Clear, collaborative discussions about risks and benefits support confident decision-making.</p>



<p>Expert teams across cardiology, maternal-fetal medicine, imaging and surgery help form a comprehensive plan tailored to each patient's needs.</p>



<p>Any expectant mother should reach out to a clinician if symptoms such as shortness of breath, difficulty breathing when lying flat, chest discomfort, palpitations, swelling that increases rapidly or new fatigue begin to interfere with daily life.</p>



<p>When something doesn't feel right, speaking up is one of the most important steps a patient can take. A strong care team is ready to help navigate each stage of pregnancy to safely support the health of both the patient and the baby.</p>

Hayes</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist and leading expert in the field of women’s heart health, says progress in research, treatment and prevention has accelerated but women still need better information.</p>



<p>Here are four things Dr. Hayes wants women to know, and do, when it comes to protecting their heart health.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oac3VY87WaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Watch: Dr. Sharonne N. Hayes talks about heart disease in women</strong></a></h3>

<p><strong>Journalists: Video sound bites are available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Sharonne N. Hayes, M.D./Cardiovascular Medicine/Mayo Clinic"&amp;nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>1. Women get heart disease, and symptoms can be missed.</strong></h2>



<p>Dr.&amp;nbsp;Hayes says there are conditions that disproportionately affect women including heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, microvascular dysfunction and heart attacks due to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-hope-for-spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection-scad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD)</a>. As a result, women with chest pain or shortness of breath were sometimes told their hearts were fine, only to learn later they did have heart disease.</p>



<p>Women were also historically excluded from clinical trials, meaning researchers are still closing evidence gaps today. Dr.&amp;nbsp;Hayes says women should trust their symptoms and continue advocating for answers when something does not feel right.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>2. Knowledge and advocacy can change outcomes.</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most encouraging changes Dr.&amp;nbsp;Hayes has seen is the rise of patient advocacy and access to health information. Women are more engaged, more informed and more willing to ask questions.</p>



<p>That shift is especially visible through advocacy organizations such as <a href="https://www.womenheart.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WomenHeart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease</a>. Women may arrive at the point of care frightened and unsure how to describe their symptoms, or they may feel alone in dealing with their diagnosis. Education, training and peer support can give them tools to feel more confident and empowered.</p>



<p>Dr.&amp;nbsp;Hayes describes the transformation as powerful, driven by knowledge and by the support women find in one another.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3. The future of heart care is promising </strong></h2>



<p>Advances in cardiology are moving quickly. Dr.&amp;nbsp;Hayes says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353124" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatments</a> that once required open-heart surgery may now be replaced by less invasive procedures, and emerging therapies offer hope that future outcomes may differ from those of past generations.</p>



<p>Study design is important. Representation in research, including artificial intelligence, can influence how findings apply. Dr. Hayes notes the role of patient data breadth in the development of new tools.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>4. Prevention starts with habits and partnership.</strong></h2>



<p>Dr.&amp;nbsp;Hayes emphasizes that it is never too early or too late to improve heart health. Healthy habits adopted in childhood reduce future risk, and starting an exercise program later in life still improves heart health.</p>



<p>She says prevention comes down to three things: behaviors, choices and knowledge. Staying physically active, avoiding tobacco, and eating a heart-healthy diet that includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains and fewer processed foods all matter. Knowing personal health numbers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, and understanding family history are also critical.</p>



<p>Equally important is working closely with a healthcare team. Medications should never be stopped without consulting a healthcare professional. If a treatment causes side effects or is not working, there are often other options, says Dr. Hayes, emphasizing the importance of patience and care teams working together to find solutions.</p>

<p>Millions of Americans continue to face <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a> despite significant improvements in mortality&amp;nbsp;rates related to the&amp;nbsp;disease&amp;nbsp;over the past century.&amp;nbsp;Rising rates of obesity,&amp;nbsp;hypertension&amp;nbsp;and diabetes contribute to this burden.&amp;nbsp;Family history&amp;nbsp;remains&amp;nbsp;a critical predictor, underscoring the importance of early awareness and risk assessment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At the heart&amp;nbsp;of this&amp;nbsp;episode's&amp;nbsp;discussion&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;the evolving understanding of obesity as a chronic, multifactorial disease. Dr. Acosta emphasizes&amp;nbsp;the need for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-researchers-pave-the-way-for-individualized-obesity-therapy-tailoring-interventions-to-a-persons-needs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">individualized</a> approaches&amp;nbsp;and notes&amp;nbsp;that people develop obesity for different biological reasons.&amp;nbsp;"Understanding&amp;nbsp;the biology&amp;nbsp;and going down to the root cause of obesity changes the conversation," Dr. Acosta says. "It helps patients see why they struggle and why tailored interventions work."&amp;nbsp;His research&amp;nbsp;demonstrates&amp;nbsp;that phenotype-based treatment strategies produce more effective and sustainable weight loss than standard models, reinforcing the importance of personalized care in addressing one of the most significant contributors to cardiovascular&amp;nbsp;disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p></p>



<p>The role of nutrition&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;another focus of this&amp;nbsp;episode. Dr. Volpp&amp;nbsp;points to&amp;nbsp;the AHA's Food Is Medicine initiative, which is building evidence&amp;nbsp;to treat healthy food like a medical therapy, especially for people with conditions such as heart failure,&amp;nbsp;diabetes&amp;nbsp;or obesity. Programs that provide medically tailored meals, produce prescriptions or nutrition coaching have shown promise in improving health and reducing hospital visits, sometimes within just weeks.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The panelists note that improvements in cardiovascular health are achievable at any age. Modest changes, such as increased consumption of&amp;nbsp;nutrient-dense&amp;nbsp;foods and consistent physical activity, can have significant positive&amp;nbsp;effects, particularly among older adults. Research&amp;nbsp;demonstrates&amp;nbsp;that even short-term dietary interventions can yield measurable improvements in stability and quality of life for patients with established cardiovascular&amp;nbsp;conditions.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking ahead, precision nutrition&amp;nbsp;represents&amp;nbsp;a promising advancement. Ongoing national research&amp;nbsp;is focused on developing individualized dietary recommendations based on genetics,&amp;nbsp;metabolism&amp;nbsp;and microbiome data. As these tools evolve, they are expected to reduce reliance on&amp;nbsp;trial-and-error&amp;nbsp;approaches&amp;nbsp;and support more effective&amp;nbsp;long-term&amp;nbsp;weight and risk&amp;nbsp;management.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The discussion highlights&amp;nbsp;a clear path forward: advance&amp;nbsp;personalized care, expand access to nutrition-focused&amp;nbsp;interventions&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;strengthen&amp;nbsp;preventive strategies across populations. Together, these efforts offer significant potential to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease and improve health outcomes in the years ahead.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart disease</a> runs in my family, and I really want to avoid developing it myself if I can. What heart-health habits should I consider starting in the new year?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;When it comes to <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-tips-for-healthy-heart-from-a-mayo-clinic-cardiologist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart health</a>, prevention still delivers the greatest return. Taking steps now — no matter how small — provides far greater benefits than managing heart disease later. Fortunately, there are many practical, sustainable ways to lower your risk, even if heart disease is common in your family.</p>



<p>A good place to begin is with the simple, everyday choices that influence your long-term cardiovascular health. To build healthier habits, start gradually. Improving your diet one step at a time, moving your body throughout the day and avoiding long periods of sitting can make a measurable difference. Small changes add up, and consistency matters more than perfection.</p>



<p>Emotional well-being also plays a vital role in heart health. Activities that bring meaning or connection, such as walking with a friend or focusing on purpose in daily life, can lower stress and support healthier behaviors. Caring for your emotional health isn't&nbsp;separate&nbsp;from caring for your heart; both are deeply interconnected.</p>



<p>Taking medications as directed is another key factor in preventing heart attacks or stroke. If you have been prescribed treatment for high blood pressure, high cholesterol or other risk factors, following your clinician's guidance and monitoring your numbers ensures those risks stay under control.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Heart-healthy steps to consider</h2>



<p>Here are eight additional steps that can strengthen your heart-health plan for the year ahead.</p>



<p><strong>1. Avoid tobacco.</strong><br>Smoking or using smokeless tobacco damages the heart and blood vessels, and it lowers the oxygen available to your body, forcing the heart to work harder. The benefits of quitting begin almost immediately, and the risk of heart disease decreases significantly within a year.</p>



<p><strong>2. Get moving every day.</strong><br>Aim for 30 minutes or more of physical activity most days of the week. Brisk walking, cycling, gardening, taking the stairs and even brief movement breaks throughout the day all contribute to better cardiovascular fitness. National guidelines recommend at least 150 minutes of moderate or intense activity weekly, but any amount of movement is better than none. If you've been inactive, increase your activity gradually.</p>



<p><strong>3. Follow a heart-healthy eating plan.</strong><br>Diet affects many major risk factors, including blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar. Heart-healthy patterns such as the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean diet</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20048456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DASH eating plan</a>&amp;nbsp;emphasize fruits, vegetables, legumes, fish, lean protein, low-fat dairy products, whole grains, and healthy fats like olive oil and avocado. Limiting salt, added sugars, refined carbohydrates, alcohol, saturated fat and processed foods, including processed meat, further protects your heart.</p>



<p><strong>4. Maintain a healthy weight.</strong><br>Excess weight, especially around your belly, raises the risk of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea and heart disease. Even modest weight loss of 3% to 5% can improve blood sugar, triglycerides and overall metabolic health.</p>



<p><strong>5. Prioritize quality sleep.</strong><br>Adults typically need at least seven hours of sleep each night. Poor sleep is linked to obesity, high blood pressure, diabetes and heart disease. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule and a restful environment. If you snore loudly, wake up gasping or feel excessively tired despite adequate sleep, talk to your clinician about screening for obstructive sleep apnea.</p>



<p><strong>6. Manage stress in healthy ways.</strong><br>Chronic stress can elevate blood pressure and affect lifestyle choices. Techniques such as mindfulness, yoga, relaxation exercises, mindful breathing, physical activity and seeking social support can lessen stress and improve overall well-being.</p>



<p><strong>7. Stay up to date with screening tests.</strong><br>High blood pressure, high cholesterol and high blood sugar often develop silently. Regular screenings allow early detection and treatment. Your clinician can recommend how often to check your numbers based on your age and risk profile.</p>



<p><strong>8. Prevent infections.</strong><br>Good dental care and staying up to date on vaccinations reduce risks associated with infections that can harm the heart or worsen existing conditions.</p>



<p>While you can't change your family history, you can adopt many habits that strengthen and protect your heart. Start with small, manageable steps, stay connected emotionally, take medications as prescribed, and partner with your care team to monitor your health.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Prevention is a powerful investment and the new year offers a perfect opportunity to begin.</p>

</div>


<p>For Loren Vinal, the holidays have always carried a gentle kind of magic. Loren's hometown of Corning, New York, and his winters on Jekyll Island, Georgia, offered two peaceful places where music and community shaped his daily life.</p>



<p>In late 2017, everything changed. After months of worsening shortness of breath and repeated misdiagnoses, Loren — a guitarist with 40 years of experience — flew to Nashville, Tennessee,&amp;nbsp;to play a show with a friend.&amp;nbsp;Loren&amp;nbsp;ended up in the&amp;nbsp;emergency department&amp;nbsp;before he could play&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/news/advanced-heart-failure-complexities-and-when-to-refer-for-specialty-care/mqc-20504989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced heart failure</a>.&amp;nbsp;He remembers the shock of that moment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Out of the blue, my life&amp;nbsp;completely&amp;nbsp;shifted,"&amp;nbsp;Loren says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>After&amp;nbsp;receiving that diagnosis, Loren spent&amp;nbsp;13 days&amp;nbsp;in the hospital&amp;nbsp;in Nashville.&amp;nbsp;Once stable,&amp;nbsp;he&amp;nbsp;returned to&amp;nbsp;upstate&amp;nbsp;New York and continued care at&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;local hospital&amp;nbsp;where specialists determined he needed a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-assist-device/about/pac-20384529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left ventricular assist device (LVAD)</a>. The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-heart-patients-helped-by-ventricular-assist-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LVAD&amp;nbsp;</a>is&amp;nbsp;a mechanical pump that supports the heart by helping the left ventricle circulate blood throughout the body.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>After&nbsp;about seven years with the LVAD, new&nbsp;complications&nbsp;in 2024 meant it was time to revisit transplant. By then, Lorena already&nbsp;knew&nbsp;about&nbsp;Mayo&nbsp;Clinic in Florida. Years earlier, he had been transferred there from a nearby hospital while wintering on Jekyll Island because smaller hospitals were not equipped to manage&nbsp;patients&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;LVAD.</p>



<p>Loren&amp;nbsp;never&amp;nbsp;forgot&amp;nbsp;the care&amp;nbsp;he received then.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I was&amp;nbsp;so impressed with the dedication and professionalism at Mayo Clinic,"&amp;nbsp;Loren says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>When he learned he was a strong&amp;nbsp;candidate&amp;nbsp;for heart transplant,&amp;nbsp;he says&amp;nbsp;the decision to pursue care&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;felt right.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Heart transplant</h2>



<p>Loren received his first heart&amp;nbsp;transplant&amp;nbsp;on July 1, 2024.&amp;nbsp;However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Loren would need another new heart, and he was relisted on the transplant waiting list in May 2025.&amp;nbsp;He spent nine and a half weeks&amp;nbsp;waiting in the hospital&amp;nbsp;before receiving his second heart&amp;nbsp;transplant&amp;nbsp;on July 19, 2025.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Waiting was difficult, but he felt supported at every turn.&amp;nbsp;Today,&amp;nbsp;Loren&amp;nbsp;shares that&amp;nbsp;he&amp;nbsp;exercises&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;plays music again&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;feeling stronger with each passing day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

</div>


<p>"A good working heart changes everything,"&amp;nbsp;Loren says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Loren speaks openly about the&amp;nbsp;gratitude he feels toward his&amp;nbsp;donors who&amp;nbsp;gave him the incredible gift of&amp;nbsp;life. "It&amp;nbsp;is the greatest gift you can bestow on another human," he says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout his journey, Loren learned more about the scope of Mayo Clinic's commitment to transplantation.&amp;nbsp;As one of the largest and most comprehensive transplant programs in the world,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a>&amp;nbsp;provides seamless care across&amp;nbsp;heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;bone&amp;nbsp;marrow&amp;nbsp;transplantation&amp;nbsp;for both adults and children.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The transplant center&amp;nbsp;teams in Arizona,&amp;nbsp;Florida&amp;nbsp;and Minnesota work together to advance innovation,&amp;nbsp;research&amp;nbsp;and education, shaping the future of transplantation worldwide.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic also leads research in organ preservation, living donation and regenerative medicine, guided by a vision that no patient should die while waiting for a transplant. These advances have helped expand access for patients with complex needs and support successful outcomes like Loren's.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Loren showed extraordinary resilience,"&amp;nbsp;says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yip-daniel-s-m-d/bio-20054324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr.&amp;nbsp;Daniel&amp;nbsp;Yip</a>,&amp;nbsp;transplant&amp;nbsp;cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.&amp;nbsp;"Even in the face of profound&amp;nbsp;challenges, he&amp;nbsp;remained&amp;nbsp;engaged and hopeful. Our team was committed to walking every step of this with him."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As Loren looks toward the&amp;nbsp;new year with a new heart, he feels a deeper joy in the moments he once took for granted:&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;strong, steady heartbeat;&amp;nbsp;music&amp;nbsp;returning&amp;nbsp;to his fingertips;&amp;nbsp;and time with the people he loves.</p>



<p>"I&amp;nbsp;sincerely thank&amp;nbsp;everyone&amp;nbsp;involved,&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;I&amp;nbsp;hope to continue to pay it forward,"&amp;nbsp;Loren says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>His story now carries its own quiet holiday light&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;hope renewed, life restored and gratitude that stretches far beyond the season.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>When a hockey coach and teacher in Minnesota experienced a cardiac event, a multidisciplinary team at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-centered-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> helped him get back in the game through teamwork and quality care</strong></p>



<p>On a winter Sunday in Owatonna, Minnesota, Ryan Harrison, a hockey coach and teacher, was wrapping up a youth game with his son, Justin. As the family loaded gear into the car and prepared to head home, Ryan pressed the start button and immediately slumped forward, unresponsive.</p>



<p>In an instant, everything changed. Chris, his wife, tried to wake him, pulling on him and calling his name, while their teenage son dialed 911. Justin ran outside the car to flag down help and, in a remarkable stroke of timing, came across a supervising nurse from Owatonna Hospital who had just left the arena.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The nurse began CPR immediately. Her intervention became the first link in a series of lifesaving events that would involve two hospitals, dozens of specialists and some of the most advanced emergency cardiac techniques available.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Somebody was watching over him," Chris says. "The right people were in the right place at exactly the right time."</p>



<p>Paramedics transported Ryan to Owatonna Hospital, where he coded again. Dense fog ruled out airlifting Ryan, and he was rushed to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester, Minnesota, by ground ambulance.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Emergency intervention at Mayo Clinic</strong></h2>



<p>The cardiac catheterization laboratory at Mayo was waiting for Ryan when he arrived in critical condition. Specialists quickly uncovered a completely blocked coronary artery and restored blood flow within minutes. But despite their swift action, his heart was still failing.&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg" alt="Ryan Harrison in the hospital" class="wp-image-409093" style="width:433px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Ryan-Harrison-hospital-1x1-1.jpg 1883w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</div>


<p>The team placed an Impella device&nbsp;—&nbsp;a tiny pump that steps in for the heart when it cannot pump enough blood&nbsp;— in Ryan.&nbsp;When his oxygen levels continued to decline despite the device being in place, the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ecmo/about/pac-20484615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</a> team was called in to provide the highest level of life support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is precisely why our teams prepare the way we do," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://quarterly.mayo.edu/directoryui/personDetails/10486500">Dr. Gurpreet Sandhu</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist.&amp;nbsp;"When a patient like Ryan arrives, every link in the chain activates instantly. People from multiple specialties converge without hesitation. That kind of teamwork is what changes outcomes."</p>



<p>Even with the blockage cleared and mechanical support in place, Ryan remained in a fragile state as he was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU). Early neurological tests offered a quiet but meaningful hope — he could move his fingers and toes.</p>



<p>"That tiny movement meant everything," Chris says. "It told us Ryan was still in there fighting."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A dangerous turn</strong></h2>



<p>Two days later, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> revealed a concerning blood clot. The scan also showed that Ryan was born with an unusual arterial configuration: a single shared artery supplying blood to his stomach, liver and bowels. Because of this rare anatomy, the clot created a complete blockage, leaving no alternate pathway for blood flow.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Ryan still needed the Impella for circulatory support, but it was also putting pressure on the artery. Taking the device out could inadvertently move the clot into the aorta, creating the possibility that it might reach his brain or heart.</p>



<p>"His anatomy and the clot location created a perfect storm," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://quarterly.mayo.edu/directoryui/personDetails/15546306">Dr. Jill Colglazier</a>, a Mayo Clinic vascular surgeon.&amp;nbsp;"We couldn't move forward without the entire care team planning every step together."</p>



<p>A multispecialty group of cardiologists, vascular surgeons, anesthesiologists, intensivists and ECMO specialists devised a creative plan in which the cardiac catheterization team would establish an alternative circulatory pathway by placing a device in Ryan's upper chest. Following this, the Impella would be removed, allowing vascular surgery to safely restore abdominal blood flow.</p>



<p>"What made this possible was not one specialty, but five or six working simultaneously," Dr. Colglazier says. "Everyone brought their expertise, and everyone trusted one another completely."</p>



<p>The surgery lasted nearly six hours and required careful timing, real-time communication and absolute precision. When it was complete, blood flow had been successfully restored.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning the corner in the ICU</strong></h2>



<p>The next morning, Ryan woke up alert and responsive. It was a pivotal moment for both his family and the medical team.</p>



<p>Now the focus shifted to determining whether his heart could function without the use of ECMO. The assessment required a multidisciplinary team at the bedside, including cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, ICU physicians, heart failure specialists, anesthesiologists and echocardiography experts.</p>



<p><a href="https://quarterly.mayo.edu/directoryui/personDetails/30127175">Dr. Philip Spencer</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon who leads the ECMO and Mechanical Circulatory Support programs, recalls the moment they tested Ryan's heart function.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"When we slowly reduce <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-teams-with-first-responders-to-improve-care-for-cardiac-arrest-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ECMO</a> flow, we're essentially asking the heart, ‘Can you take over now?'" Dr. Spencer says. "It is a powerful moment when you see it respond. There's a sense of collective relief because every team has been working toward that one goal."</p>



<p>Dr. Spencer credits the seamless teamwork for Ryan's recovery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's not a handoff from one specialty to the next," Dr. Spencer says. "It's multiple teams taking care of the same patient at the same time, each doing what they do best."</p>



<p>Ryan's heart held steady. The ECMO was removed, and for the first time since his collapse, he was breathing, beating and healing completely on his own.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rebuilding strength and confidence</strong></h2>



<p>With the immediate danger behind him, Ryan began rehabilitation. He tackled small but meaningful steps: sitting up, walking short distances, lifting light weights and completing cognitive exercises. The ICU nurses and therapists encouraged him through each milestone.</p>



<p>One of the things Ryan remembers most was how often staff returned to check on him — even when they were not assigned to his care that day.</p>



<p>"They didn't just keep me alive," Ryan says. "They lifted me up. I felt like I was everyone's patient, not just one person's. Their teamwork made me feel like I wasn't doing this alone."</p>



<p>Chris felt that support too,&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"They cared about Ryan as a person," Chris says. "They cared about us as a family. That kind of compassion can't be taught."</p>



<p>Ryan completed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardiac-rehabilitation-program/overview/ovc-20442302" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiac rehabilitation</a>, regained his stamina and later received an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/implantable-cardioverter-defibrillators/about/pac-20384692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implantable cardioverter-defibrillator</a> as a long-term safety measure. Slowly, life returned to the rhythm he recognized.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Life renewed</strong></h2>



<p>Today, Ryan walks several miles a day, has returned to golfing and is coaching hockey again. Everyday moments, such as watching Justin skate, visiting his daughter at college and waking up next to Chris, have taken on deeper meaning. He understands just how close he came to losing them.</p>



<p>When he reflects on his survival, he thinks about the coordinated efforts of people who may never meet one another but were nonetheless part of the same chain: the nurse in the parking lot, first responders, Owatonna clinicians, Mayo's interventional cardiology team, ECMO specialists, vascular and cardiac surgeons, anesthesiologists, ICU nurses, rehabilitation therapists, and many others.</p>



<p>When Ryan tells his players, "We, not me," he now understands the phrase in a way only someone who has relied on an entire community of caregivers can truly understand.</p>



<p>"They gave me my husband back," Chris says. "I will never forget that."</p>



<p>And Ryan, back in the game he loves, simply says, "Every day is a gift."</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I've heard that all the stress of the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-recognizing-holiday-heart-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">holidays</a> can lead to a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attack</a>. What's the link, and what can I do to reduce my risk?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>It's easy to get caught up in the stress and chaos that accompany the holiday season. For some women, their busy lives become even more hectic, and the result can be overwhelming. Also, women often ignore the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease/art-20046167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms of heart disease</a>.</p>



<p>Heart disease is the No. 1 killer for women and men. More women die of heart disease than of breast cancer. Taking care of your heart health involves avoiding risk factors or behaviors that contribute to heart disease, recognizing symptoms, and seeking treatment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Risk factors for heart disease</strong></h2>



<p>Traditional risk factors for coronary artery disease include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, smoking tobacco and obesity. However, nontraditional risk factors, such as stress, anxiety and depression, also affect heart health.</p>



<p>People often underestimate the negative effects that psychosocial stress can have on their heart health. Psychosocial stressors are life situations that cause unusual or intense stress, such as divorce, family conflicts, death of a loved one, prolonged illness or a natural catastrophe.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies have shown that depression and psychosocial stress are associated with heart attacks. High stress levels also have been shown to negatively affect health recovery after a heart attack. It's important to address both traditional and nontraditional risks for heart disease and recognize that they affect men and women differently.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How does stress lead to heart attacks?</strong></h2>



<p>Psychosocial stress can be short-term or long-term, and both types have been associated with heart disease. Exactly how <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-basics/hlv-20049495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a> leads to a heart attack is still being studied.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress/art-20046037" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emotional stress</a>&nbsp;can lead to an increase in blood pressure, or hypertension, which subsequently leads to heart disease and plaque buildup in the coronary arteries. Emotional stress also can lead to increased levels of stress hormones, or cortisol. These hormones affect platelets and autonomic tone, which is how your body controls involuntary functions such as heart rate and blood pressure. All these factors play a role in heart disease.</p>



<p>Stress can also lead to unhealthy mechanisms for coping with stress, such as stress eating or substance abuse, and not exercising, which in turn can lead to heart disease.</p>



<p>Short-term, extremely stressful situations can cause severe but usually temporary heart failure. This condition is called broken heart syndrome, also known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/broken-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20354617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takotsubo cardiomyopathy</a>, apical ballooning syndrome or stress cardiomyopathy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the risk factors for heart disease in women?</strong></h2>



<p>Women of all ages should take heart disease seriously. Women under 65, and especially those with a family history of heart disease, need to pay close attention to heart disease risk factors. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Diabetes.</li>



<li>Mental stress and depression.</li>



<li>Smoking.</li>



<li>Inactivity.</li>



<li>Alcohol consumption.</li>



<li>Menopause, due to low levels of estrogen and developing menopause before 40.</li>



<li>Pregnancy complications, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, or even premature delivery.</li>



<li>Inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are heart disease symptoms in women?</strong></h2>



<p>Women and men are equally likely to experience chest pain, pressure or discomfort. But women are more likely to have other associated symptoms, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Neck, jaw, shoulder, upper back or abdominal discomfort.</li>



<li>Shortness of breath.</li>



<li>Pain in one or both arms.</li>



<li>Nausea or vomiting.</li>



<li>Sweating.</li>



<li>Lightheadedness or dizziness.</li>



<li>Unusual fatigue.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you experience chest pain with the symptoms mentioned above, call 911 right away.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Managing holiday stress</strong></h2>



<p>For many women, the holiday season brings the most cherished moments in their lives, but it also can be among the most stressful times of the year. Often this is because people carry expectations influenced by memories and societal pressures ― a smiling, happy family photo on holiday cards, the smell of grandma's home cooking at Hanukkah, seeing a Christmas tree lit or singing your favorite Kwanzaa song.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>These sights, smells and sounds of the season become measures of happiness and satisfaction. However, these visions don't always match reality, and that can lead to stress.</p>



<p>At any time, but especially during the holidays, the key to coping is setting realistic expectations. Take a few moments as a family to write down what would make the holidays an enjoyable time with those you love. And let go of the things that add stress and no joy.</p>



<p>Other lifestyle changes that can help curb stress during the holidays and throughout the year include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increase physical exercise.</li>



<li>Practice relaxation exercises.</li>



<li>Make a connection to your spirituality.</li>



<li>Seek professional help.</li>



<li>Eat a healthy diet.</li>



<li>Limit alcohol.</li>



<li>Stop smoking.</li>



<li>Monitor your heart health.<br></li>
</ul>

<p></p>



<p>Just 5%–10% of people who need cardiac <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a> get the exam because of barriers like cost, time and access, says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/leiner-tim-m-d-ph-d/bio-20530564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Tim Leiner</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiologist who, along with <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-radiology/about/faculty-staff?letter=b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jacinta Browne,</a> a Mayo Clinic radiology researcher, leads the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leiner-tim-m-d-ph-d/bio-20578352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Artificial Intelligence for Cardiovascular Imaging Research and Exploration Program</a>.</p>



<p>Imaging of the heart, especially with MRI, is an important part of diagnosing heart disease, the leading cause of death worldwide.</p>



<p>"That means they are operating without the best possible information. At Mayo the problem is lessened because we have so many resources, but, in general, this is a huge problem," Dr. Leiner says.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic, in collaboration with Philips, an international health technology company, is testing a low-field MRI scanner enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI) to shorten scan times and improve image quality.</p>



<p>The team's work initially is searching for solutions in cardiac imaging while also looking at other parts of the body where their work can make an impact. They also hope to see cardiac MRI accessible to more people.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic is always investing resources and being at the forefront, trying to solve problems," Dr. Leiner says. "I think the secret is to stay curious and surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. And you create a safe atmosphere where people can speak up and bring ideas to the table for an open discussion."</p>



<p>The program's approach seeks to blend hardware and software developments to achieve results the researchers hope will be as good as or better than current methods.</p>



<p>Dr. Leiner says the team wants to learn if a new type of scanner, a 0.6-Tesla (0.6T) low-field-strength MRI system, is able to produce high-quality images faster and more easily for patients. </p>



<p>"Radiology is about getting the piece of information from the imaging test that allows you to make the best decision in the patient's care management, and once you have that information, you can move on," Dr. Leiner says. "I think what we're learning is that this lower field strength is entirely capable of giving you that information."</p>

<p>The Artificial Intelligence for Cardiovascular Imaging Research and Exploration Program brings together Mayo Clinic physicians, physicists and scientists from across specialties, including Radiology and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardiovascular Medicine</a>, as well as Philips, which installed the research-prototype MRI scanner in One Discovery Square on the Mayo Clinic campus in Rochester, Minnesota. Philips is a collaborator on research with the system.</p>



<p>"It's a truly multidisciplinary lab that I think can bring about a lot of progress because you're getting viewpoints from scientists, clinicians and engineers," Dr. Browne says. "That means that what you're doing will be impactful for patient care."</p>

<p>Dr. Browne says Philips' presence on site enhances their research as well. "What is really great is the close collaboration that we have with Philips, the fact that we can just walk into each other's offices and chat. And because we have an agreement with them, we have first access to a lot of the new work-in-progress products, and we're at the table with them so we can also influence slightly the way in which they are going to go with some of those products," she says. </p>



<p></p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic’s cardiac MRI research program has the potential to improve patient access to vital diagnostic imaging," said Dr. Ioannis Panagiotelis, business leader of MR at Philips. "Their commitment to improving patient care through faster, more accessible, and personalized imaging aligns closely with our mission, and collaborating with their multidisciplinary team allows us to contribute technology that could make a meaningful difference for patients."</p>



<p>The Artificial Intelligence for Cardiovascular Imaging Research and Exploration Program is looking at what improvements may be feasible for cardiac MRI in several areas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Is there a way to more uniquely tailor exams in real time?</li>



<li>Can scan duration be reduced?</li>



<li>Can imaging distortions created by medical implants be reduced?</li>



<li>Can diagnosis be improved?</li>
</ul>



<p>"We are investigating what we can do with such a system for cardiac imaging and for other body areas," Dr. Leiner says. Both Mayo and Philips are contributing AI algorithms to integrate into the scanner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Imaging the individual</strong></h2>



<p>"We're looking at having a personalized cardiac MRI examination, which is going to be autonomous," Dr. Browne says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>She adds that the goal is for images to be segmented and measured during the first scan sequence so it can be determined if the heart is functioning normally or if there are signs of cardiac disease. Those findings can then help determine — in real time — whether additional imaging is needed and, if so, what sequences will provide the necessary information to assist in treatment planning.</p>



<p>"You're tailoring that examination, but you're also potentially shortening the majority of the examination, so we'll get some time savings," she says, adding that the immediacy of the information would allow for additional imaging at that time to save the patient from having to return for a follow-up.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Faster scan time</strong></h2>



<p>Need for cardiac imaging exceeds scanner availability, Dr. Leiner says, so it's important to use existing machines as efficiently as possible to ensure that patients get the scans they need when they need them.</p>



<p>He says the program is looking for ways to develop faster imaging protocols to scan patients quickly while getting the necessary clinical information for diagnosis and treatment planning. Cardiac exams are typically an hour long.</p>



<p>"One way we're doing that is by using AI tools to shorten the image acquisition time, though if you shorten the acquisition time, you get lower signal-to-noise in MRI (meaning the images may not be as clear)," Dr. Leiner says. "But if you denoise the images that you get, those sort of lower-quality images, you can then reconstruct images that look as good as if they were acquired with a normal spatial resolution and machine settings."</p>



<p>If successful, these tools may reduce scan time, he adds. "It's about making this whole pipeline more efficient and more robust."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clearer images</strong></h2>



<p>With stronger MRI systems, most often 1.5T or 3T scanners, imaging patients who have implanted medical devices such as pacemakers can be challenging, Dr. Leiner says. With the higher-field-strength machines, those devices create distortions, called artifacts, in the images that can reduce anatomical visibility for physicians.</p>



<p>He says the researchers hope that the 0.6T scanner and AI solutions will help reduce the noise and improve the clarity in those images.</p>



<p>"What we need to do is come up with new ways in which we can get a higher signal, whether that is through the physics engineering of the pulse sequences we use in order to get the examination or whether it is through the use of AI, using denoising and image-sharpening techniques," Dr. Browne says. "There are so many unanswered questions because we don't know how this technology is going to work for all of the standard cardiac examinations."</p>



<p>"It's not inconceivable that in the future, AI algorithms will be able to reduce some artifacts at higher field strengths that you get in patients with devices or with other issues," Dr. Leiner says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shared knowledge</strong></h2>



<p>Research from the Artificial Intelligence for Cardiovascular Imaging Research and Exploration Program will be shared during the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) 111th Scientific Assembly and Annual Meeting Nov. 30—Dec. 4 in Chicago.</p>

<p>PHOENIX — Current genetic screening guidelines fail to identify most people with an inherited condition known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-hypercholesterolemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20353755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">familial hypercholesterolemia</a> that can cause dangerously <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high cholesterol</a> and early heart disease, a Mayo Clinic study found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The condition often passes silently through families for generations. It is highly treatable, yet people who remain undiagnosed are at greater risk for heart attacks and strokes.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, affecting millions of adults each year. It includes conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure and stroke. One of its key risk factors is high cholesterol.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCGEN.125.005174" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Circulation: Genomic and Precision Medicine, suggests that routine screening could identify the majority of people with the inherited condition and, ultimately, save lives.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Study reveals missed diagnoses</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Researchers found that nearly 90% of those with familial hypercholesterolemia would not have been flagged for standard genetic testing and were unaware they had the condition until DNA testing in a Mayo Clinic population-based research study identified them. About 1 in 5 had already developed coronary artery disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our findings expose a blind spot in current national guidelines, which rely on cholesterol levels and family history to determine who should receive genetic testing," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/samadder-niloy-jewel-m-d/bio-20396993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niloy Jewel Samadder, M.D.</a>, lead author and a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist and cancer geneticist at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. "If we can find those at risk of cardiovascular disease early, we can treat it early and change its course and likely save lives."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is one of the most common genetic conditions, affecting an estimated 1 in 200 to 250 people worldwide. It causes very high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol — the "bad" cholesterol — from birth.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The study analyzed data from exome sequencing, a form of genetic testing that reads the protein-coding regions of the genome — where most disease-causing variants are found. The research included more than 84,000 participants across Mayo Clinic sites in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota through the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinics-largest-ever-exome-study-offers-blueprint-for-biomedical-breakthroughs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapestry DNA research study</a>, part of the institution's effort to integrate genomics into everyday patient care.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team identified 419 people with genetic variants known to cause familial hypercholesterolemia. They found that nearly 75% of those individuals would not have met current clinical criteria for genetic testing based on their cholesterol levels or family history. This represents a missed opportunity for disease prevention.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrating genetics into preventive care</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Dr. Samadder says the next step is to bring genetic screening into routine care to identify high-risk patients earlier and start treatment sooner.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The work is part of Mayo Clinic's Precure strategic priority, which aims to predict and prevent serious diseases before they advance. Through innovative technologies and population-based studies, Precure is designed to bring prevention-focused care directly to patients sooner.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>
