<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;<br>A close friend of mine recently had an abnormal result on a routine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap test</a>&nbsp;that led to a cancer diagnosis.&nbsp;I know cancer screenings are important, but&nbsp;it's&nbsp;hard to keep track of which ones I should prioritize.&nbsp;Could you help me&nbsp;better understand <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer screening</a> and&nbsp;other screenings I should&nbsp;consider&nbsp;now?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Cancer screenings play a critical role in protecting long-term health. They can detect cancer early, when treatment is most effective, and in some cases help prevent cancer before it develops. While screening recommendations&nbsp;vary based&nbsp;on age, sex, family history and personal risk&nbsp;factors, several key&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;screening&nbsp;tests should be reviewed regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cervical cancer screening is an important part of preventive care and has helped significantly reduce deaths from this disease. Understanding how screening works can help people stay up to date.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cervical cancer:&nbsp;Why screening is essential</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;most often caused by long-term infection with certain high-risk types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a>.&nbsp;HPV is common, and&nbsp;while most&nbsp;of these&nbsp;infections are cleared by a person's immune system,&nbsp;other&nbsp;HPV&nbsp;infections&nbsp;can persist for years without causing symptoms.&nbsp;People&nbsp;also&nbsp;can become&nbsp;infected with HPV more than once in their lifetime.&nbsp;That's&nbsp;why routine screening is the best way to detect abnormal changes early.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Pap test&nbsp;and HPV&nbsp;test</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>During a Pap test, a healthcare professional gently collects cells from the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. These cells are examined for abnormal changes that could develop into cancer if left untreated. The test is usually quick and can be done during a routine gynecologic visit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An HPV test is often done at the same time as a Pap test using the same cell sample,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;checks for high-risk types of HPV that are most likely to lead to cervical cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cervical cancer screening does more than look for cancer. Pap tests and HPV tests can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;precancerous changes in the cervix. When these changes are found and treated early, cervical cancer&nbsp;often&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;prevented.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cervical cancer screening recommendations</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ages 21 to 29:</strong>&nbsp;A Pap test every three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ages 30 to 65:</strong>&nbsp;Several screening options may be&nbsp;appropriate:&nbsp;
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HPV test alone every five years.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pap&nbsp;test&nbsp;every three years.&nbsp;</li>



<li>combined Pap and HPV&nbsp;(called co-testing)&nbsp;testing every five years.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Over age 65:</strong>&nbsp;Some people may be able to stop screening if they&nbsp;have&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;normal&nbsp;Pap or co-test&nbsp;results and no history of&nbsp;severe&nbsp;cervical&nbsp;precancer. The&nbsp;decision&nbsp;to stop cervical cancer screening&nbsp;should always be made&nbsp;together with a&nbsp;healthcare professional.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>If a Pap or HPV test shows abnormal results,&nbsp;additional&nbsp;evaluation may be recommended. This can include repeat testing,&nbsp;a&nbsp;colposcopy&nbsp;—&nbsp;a cervical exam&nbsp;done by a clinician using&nbsp;a special magnifying scope&nbsp;—&nbsp;or&nbsp;a cervical&nbsp;biopsy. While abnormal results can be concerning, they often detect changes long before cancer develops, allowing for effective treatment and careful follow-up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Other cancer screenings to review</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Depending on age and personal risk factors, other cancer screenings&nbsp;also&nbsp;may&nbsp;be recommended.&nbsp;A healthcare professional can help&nbsp;determine&nbsp;which screenings&nbsp;you&nbsp;should&nbsp;schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Breast cancer screening</strong></a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;mammography&nbsp;is&nbsp;advised&nbsp;for many people beginning at midlife.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Low-dose&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-cancer-screening/about/pac-20385024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>CT screening for lung cancer</strong></a>&nbsp;for those with a significant history of smoking&nbsp;may be&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;every&nbsp;year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-screening/art-20046825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Colorectal cancer screening</strong></a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended for most adults beginning at midlife and sometimes earlier for those with a family history or other risk factors. Screening options include colonoscopy and stool-based tests. These screenings can detect colorectal cancer at an early stage or remove precancerous polyps before they develop into cancer.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Anal cancer</strong>&nbsp;is less common, but&nbsp;it's&nbsp;also associated with HPV infection. Routine screening&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;recommended for the general population. However, people with certain risk factors, such as a weakened immune system or a history of HPV-related&nbsp;precancers or cancers, may&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from closer monitoring. Symptoms,&nbsp;including rectal bleeding, pain,&nbsp;itching&nbsp;or a lump,&nbsp;should always be evaluated by a healthcare professional.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Make&nbsp;screening part of your routine</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>An annual visit with a primary care clinician or gynecologist is a good opportunity to review your screening history, discuss vaccines and address new symptoms or concerns. Keeping track of when your last Pap&nbsp;test, HPV&nbsp;test,&nbsp;mammogram&nbsp;or colorectal screening&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;can help ensure&nbsp;that&nbsp;care&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;delayed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cervical Cancer Awareness Month&nbsp;is&nbsp;an important reminder that prevention works. Through regular screening and&nbsp;timely&nbsp;follow-up, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers. Taking a proactive approach to screenings this year can&nbsp;help&nbsp;protect health now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — In a new <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-025-05308-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot feasibility study</a>, researchers from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, the University of Washington School of Medicine, the University of California San Francisco, and Nextrast Inc. found that a new imaging oral agent, also known as a "contrast agent," helps radiologists better see bowel structures and disease in CT imaging when compared with the current oral contrast agents.</p>

<p>The introduction of a new oral contrast agent for CT imaging addresses common challenges in the diagnosis of bowel diseases, says by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fletcher-joel-g-m-d/bio-20053419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Fletcher, M.D.</a>, lead author on the study and medical director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/ct-clinical-innovation-center/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic CT Clinical Innovation Center</a>. "The new oral contrast agent," he explains, "is ingested by patients prior to CT imaging and helps detect pathologies within and outside of the bowel wall in ways current imaging agents do not."</p>



<p>"We carefully designed this new class of oral contrast agent to overcome many of the diagnostic shortcomings of existing contrast agents for a broad range of diseases," says <a href="https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/benjamin-yeh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Yeh, M.D.</a>, a co-author on the study, radiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and co-founder of Nextrast, which created the new agent. "The Clinical Phase 2 results confirm that our dark agent can reveal previously impossible-to-detect findings, including very small bowel tumors and subtle inflammatory conditions that are often missed with conventional agents at CT."</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-025-05308-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, the authors report findings that suggest this new agent significantly improves visualization of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or cancer within the abdomen, and may provide earlier and more confident diagnoses.</p>



<p>The study compared CT scans of 32 patients with the dark borosilicate oral contrast agent and scans with conventional water or iodine-based oral contrast agents, to look at anatomical structures and disease presence.</p>



<p>"The novel dark borosilicate contrast agent has the potential to improve the assessment of numerous pathologies, including the detection of cancer and inflammatory disorders," says <a href="https://rad.uw.edu/people/amileto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achille Mileto, M.D.</a>, a radiologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and first author of the study.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-1024x576.jpg" alt="CT images from a patient who ingested the new oral solution that better distends the stomach (see the white S) and small bowel (asterisks) so that enhancing pathologies inside and outside the bowel wall can be better displayed and detected by radiologists." class="wp-image-409656" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image.jpg 1360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">CT images from a patient who ingested the new oral solution that better distends the stomach (see the white S) and small bowel (asterisks) so that enhancing pathologies inside and outside the bowel wall can be better displayed and detected by radiologists.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evaluators identified clinically relevant findings in seven patients that were not detected using the standard contrast.</p>



<p>"CT scans performed with the new agent will likely do a better job of displaying pathologies in the stomach and proximal small bowel, areas where CT with traditional oral contrast performs poorly," Dr. Fletcher says. "Pathologies within the lumen will be better displayed because the lumen is more distended, and the brightness of the pathologies on the CT images will be increased, making them more conspicuous.”</p>



<p>The researchers say further study using a larger patient population is needed, but the initial findings show promise.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Our daughter was recently diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370594">cancer</a>. She's interested in participating in a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/about-cancer-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a> but doesn't really know what that means or how to get involved. Can you help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>A cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming and often comes with a long list of decisions to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people are surprised to learn that clinical trials aren't just for people who have run out of standard treatment options, but are an important part of cancer care at every stage and most aspects of diagnosis and treatment. They help physicians study new and better ways to diagnose, treat and improve the quality of life for people. They also give patients access to promising treatments that they might not otherwise receive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens in a cancer clinical trial?</strong></h2>



<p>During a clinical trial, participants may receive specific interventions or potentially the standard treatment. Researchers measure how safe and effective the interventions are and usually compare them to standard treatments. These may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>New cancer drugs or drug combinations.</li>



<li>New medical procedures or devices.</li>



<li>New surgical techniques.</li>



<li>New ways to use existing treatments.</li>



<li>Lifestyle or behavioral approaches.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions is that joining a trial means you might not receive treatment or be given a placebo. Most clinical trials compare a new treatment with the current standard of care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who's eligible for a trial?</strong></h2>



<p>Your daughter’s care team is the best starting point. Feel free to ask if she is a candidate for any trial. Physicians at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> routinely review whether patients qualify for available trials. If there's a study that's potentially right for your daughter, your team can connect her with research coordinators and help navigate eligibility, consent, scheduling and next steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do people find and sign up for trials?</strong></h2>



<p>Patients can find out about trials in several ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Direct referral from their care team (medical oncologist, surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, radiologist to name a few).</li>



<li>Search tools, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic clinical trials website</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.</li>



<li>Trial navigators or research coordinators who help determine eligibility and guide enrollment.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>When a clinician identifies that a patient may be a good candidate for a study, they review the study purpose, what participation involves, potential risks and benefits, and available alternatives. Patients can take time to decide whether to participate and may bring family members or caregivers into these conversations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinic Trials Beyond Walls: Expanding who can participate</strong></h2>



<p>Participating in a clinical trial typically has meant frequent trips to a major medical center, which is something that can be difficult for people balancing work, caregiving responsibilities, transportation needs or facing financial strain.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-to-expand-access-to-state-of-the-art-cancer-care-through-transformational-gift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Cancer Trials Beyond Walls</a> is an initiative that brings elements of cancer clinical trials closer to home, such as lab draws, remote patient monitoring and virtual visits. This brings the benefits of research directly to patients' doorsteps and makes trial participation more manageable for families.</p>

</div>


<p>Mayo Clinic's decentralized research initiative uses telehealth, remote monitoring, mobile phlebotomy and home-based services so patients can complete parts of a clinical trial without traveling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The care of these patients being managed at home, with the support of a dedicated clinical team, may include vital sign monitoring, symptom reporting, medication administration or follow-up assessments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why do clinical trials matter so much?</strong></h2>



<p>Every cancer therapy available today exists because patients such as your daughter volunteered to participate. Volunteering for trials is a crucial way to advance medical treatment.<br><br>Joining a trial may give your daughter access to cutting-edge care and contribute to future breakthroughs.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — To help meet the potentially complex needs of patients after prostate cancer treatment and offer the precision and care necessary in the follow-up journey, Mayo Clinic’s Department of Radiation Oncology developed the PSA Control Tower. This is an intelligent monitoring tool designed to support clinicians in keeping a close, ongoing watch over patients after treatment.</p>



<p>Traditionally, the follow-up care for prostate cancer patients follows a standard schedule and relies on manual review. This process can be time-consuming and may delay care due to administrative steps. Subtle but important changes in test results can be missed or recognized too late. Because of this, patients often need faster intervention and a more personalized approach to care.</p>



<p>Prostate cancer follow-up depends on understanding prostate-specific antigen (PSA) trends over time. Each PSA test is important, but spotting early signs of recurrence requires regular contact and ongoing monitoring. As patient numbers grow and care becomes more complex, this process can be difficult to manage. Health systems are under increasing pressure to provide reliable follow-up without adding strain to care teams.</p>



<p>The PSA Control Tower brings together clinical information and PSA trends, using intelligent tools to support care teams in understanding which patients may need attention and when. By bringing potential concerns to light earlier, the system helps teams stay connected to patients. Throughout the process, clinical expertise, thoughtful judgment, and human connection continue to guide every decision.</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, the PSA Control Tower is powered by <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform</a>, which provides a secure environment where Mayo Clinic staff have access to large amounts of de-identified patient data. This enables teams to study patterns over time and build predictive models using information such as lab results, clinical notes, imaging and pathology.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/Dr.-Mark-Waddle_1652626_3911824_0002-200x300.jpg" alt="Portrait of Dr. Mark Waddle" class="wp-image-409486" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/Dr.-Mark-Waddle_1652626_3911824_0002-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/Dr.-Mark-Waddle_1652626_3911824_0002-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/Dr.-Mark-Waddle_1652626_3911824_0002.jpg 750w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mark Waddle, M.D.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>“Our hope is that the PSA Control Tower will be a rare win-win-win for patients, physicians and hospital systems,” says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/waddle-mark-r-m-d/bio-20532761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Waddle, M.D.</a> “The ‘Control Tower’ will allow each and every patient to be monitored 24/7 — for peace of mind that all patients are being followed per guidelines and that abnormal PSA values are acted upon.”</p>



<p>As new data are introduced, the predictive models continue to learn and improve. Through Mayo Clinic Platform technology, clinicians will be able to easily view PSA trends and recurrence risk through clear dashboards, giving them timely information to support informed conversations and personalized care while keeping clinical expertise and compassion at the center.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A scalable vision for the future</strong></h2>



<p>The PSA Control Tower reflects Mayo Clinic’s Bold. Forward. vision for precision oncology, which includes combining advanced analytics, secure data access, and seamless clinical integration. As this model expands beyond Mayo Clinic, it offers a path toward earlier detection, more efficient workflows, and scalable, data-driven follow-up care for prostate cancer patients nationwide.</p>



<p>“This allows our care providers to see more new patients, treat more complex patients, and focus effort related to prostate cancer follow-up on the patients that truly need their expertise and time,” says Dr. Waddle.</p>

<p>PHOENIX&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;researchers have developed and evaluated MedEduChat, an electronic health record (EHR)&nbsp;that&nbsp;works with&nbsp;a&nbsp;large language model to provide accurate, patient-specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-02166-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Portfolio Digital Medicine</a>&nbsp;and highlight&nbsp;a new approach&nbsp;to delivering&nbsp;timely, individualized guidance for people navigating a prostate cancer diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer patients often face uncertainty as they process complex information about their diagnosis and treatment options. Limited time with clinicians can make it difficult for patients to receive the detailed answers they need to understand decisions that shape their care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;study&nbsp;demonstrates&nbsp;how advanced AI, grounded in Mayo-validated clinical data, can help bridge these gaps by delivering clear, conversational explanations based on each patient's own health record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the patient experience using&nbsp;AI</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fifteen prostate cancer patients interacted with&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;for 20 to 30 minutes as part of a mixed-method usability study conducted at Mayo Clinic campuses in Arizona and Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients reported higher confidence after using the tool, with Health Confidence Scores increasing from 9.9 to 13.9 on a 16-point scale. Usability scores were also high;&nbsp;average survey responses ranked MedEduChat&nbsp;83.7 out of 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients noted that&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;helped them understand their diagnosis in a more accessible way. The&nbsp;tool&nbsp;provided relief by explaining unfamiliar or complex terms&nbsp;in a clear and concise manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversational format&nbsp;helped&nbsp;participants replace incorrect assumptions with medically accurate information derived from their own EHR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinician-evaluated accuracy and safety</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/liu-wei-ph-d/bio-20055721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wei Liu, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;a radiation oncology medical physicist,&nbsp;and three Mayo Clinic clinicians independently reviewed 85 anonymized question-and-response pairs. They rated MedEduChat's answers as highly correct (2.9 out of 3), complete (2.7 out of 3) and safe (2.7 out of 3).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinicians also noted strong patient-readiness and moderate personalization, reflecting&nbsp;MedEduChat's ability to tailor explanations to each person's age, treatment history and cancer stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;delivered&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;and clinically aligned information, clinicians emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring to prevent errors that could arise from incomplete or inconsistently documented EHR data.</p>



<p>The research team incorporated a&nbsp;multilayer&nbsp;approach&nbsp;to address these concerns and guide future system enhancements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Combining patient-centered education with AI</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>MedEduChat&nbsp;was designed with a structured educational model that combines closed-domain clinical data, semi-structured guidance and personalized interaction.</p>



<p>Patients can explore diagnosis details, learn about treatment options and side effects, and review lifestyle considerations and follow-up expectations. The tool draws only from validated sources,&nbsp;such as Mayo Clinic materials and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>&nbsp;guidelines.</p>



<p>"This research demonstrates how large language models can be safely and effectively integrated into real clinical systems to improve cancer education,"&nbsp;according&nbsp;to Dr. Liu.&nbsp;"By combining advanced AI with Mayo Clinic's electronic health records, MedEduChat delivers personalized, accurate and easy-to-understand explanations tailored to each patient's medical history."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expanding AI&nbsp;cancer research</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study team plans to translate this work into clinical use across all three Mayo Clinic campuses&nbsp;in Arizona,&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;and Minnesota. Next steps include expanding MedEduChat beyond radiation oncology to additional cancer specialties. These efforts aim to make personalized AI-assisted education a routine part of cancer care.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER,&nbsp;Minn.&nbsp;—&nbsp;A&nbsp;multidisciplinary surgical team&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;has successfully treated an exceptionally rare and life-threatening cancer that&nbsp;invaded a&nbsp;patient's&nbsp;heart and airway. The procedure&nbsp;combined&nbsp;advanced cardiac surgery with complex airway reconstruction and&nbsp;represents&nbsp;a significant achievement in modern cancer care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tami Channel's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid cancer</a>&nbsp;was so advanced&nbsp;that&nbsp;her family&nbsp;had begun&nbsp;planning hospice care. The&nbsp;tumor had&nbsp;severely compromised&nbsp;her&nbsp;airway&nbsp;and&nbsp;had encased her carotid artery and jugular vein, two of the body's most vital blood vessels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Primary cancers&nbsp;of&nbsp;the heart are extremely rare. Most tumors that appear in the heart are benign, and malignant cardiac tumors such as sarcomas account for only a&nbsp;small&nbsp;fraction of all cancers. Airway tumors involving the throat or trachea are also uncommon and often detected late because early symptoms can&nbsp;resemble&nbsp;routine respiratory&nbsp;issues. When&nbsp;a malignant&nbsp;growth extends into both the heart and the airway, the risks multiply quickly because the tumor can narrow or block breathing passages and interfere with the heart's ability to function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Faced with a tumor that had grown into vital structures and left the patient's airway&nbsp;nearly the&nbsp;width of a toothpick, the care team, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ryder-mabel-m-d/bio-20055734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mabel Ryder, M.D.</a>,&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/moore-eric-j-m-d/bio-20053794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Moore, M.D.</a>,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mayo Clinic head and neck surgeon,&nbsp;recognized that conventional treatment would not be enough.&nbsp;Tami needed&nbsp;a highly complex&nbsp;surgery — and it needed to happen quickly.&nbsp;As a matter of priority, Tami would undergo an unscheduled thoracotomy and bypass, an emergency open-chest operation that requires opening the chest cavity, supporting circulation through a heart-lung machine, and working around critical airways and blood vessels. Few hospitals could coordinate such a demanding procedure so quickly.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="973" height="547" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Tami-Channel-Dr.-Eric-Moore-16x9-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-408921" style="aspect-ratio:1.778836609092714;width:613px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Tami-Channel-Dr.-Eric-Moore-16x9-1.jpg 973w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Tami-Channel-Dr.-Eric-Moore-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Tami-Channel-Dr.-Eric-Moore-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tami Channel with Dr. Eric Moore</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>"We were able to make it happen because it needed to be done," Dr. Moore says. "That's the Mayo difference."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The operating room reflected Mayo's integrated model: anesthesiology, perfusion, bronchoscopy, cardiothoracic surgery,&nbsp;and head and neck surgery, with each discipline contributing seamlessly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It felt like&nbsp;a choreographed&nbsp;ballet," Dr. Moore says. "This kind of multidisciplinary precision doesn't just happen — it's the Mayo model in action."&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the same operation, specialists reconstructed the airway to restore safe breathing. Procedures of this complexity rely on close coordination among cardiac surgeons, thoracic and airway surgeons, ear, nose and throat&nbsp;specialists, anesthesiologists,&nbsp;oncologists,&nbsp;and critical care teams. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;experts&nbsp;are&nbsp;uniquely positioned to manage these cases because they can move quickly from diagnosis&nbsp;to&nbsp;complex&nbsp;surgery&nbsp;and recovery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This successful intervention shows what is possible when specialists collaborate on rare cancers that cross organ systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Early on, he saw that many families lived with uncertainty of their cancer risk, especially when genetic tests revealed variants no one fully understood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He set out to change that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Couch&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;consultant&nbsp;in&nbsp;laboratory medicine and pathology&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;and holds the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professorship in Medical Research in Honor of Dr. Thomas J. McDonald.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic works with an international network of collaborators, which includes Dr. Couch and his team,&nbsp;who have&nbsp;helped&nbsp;identify&nbsp;many inherited gene alterations that contribute to breast cancer risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="857" height="857" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Fergus-Couch-Ph.D.-1554072_3786066_0018-1x1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-409119" style="width:239px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Fergus-Couch-Ph.D.-1554072_3786066_0018-1x1-1.jpg 857w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Fergus-Couch-Ph.D.-1554072_3786066_0018-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Fergus-Couch-Ph.D.-1554072_3786066_0018-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/12/Fergus-Couch-Ph.D.-1554072_3786066_0018-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px"></figure>
</div>


<p>"We interact on a thematic level — surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, geneticists and biochemists," Dr. Couch shares. "We all work together, focused on improving our knowledge of breast cancer and quickly developing treatments and cures for patients at Mayo Clinic."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year,&nbsp;Dr. Couch and other co-authors&nbsp;published&nbsp;a study in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>,&nbsp;which&nbsp;included&nbsp;one of the most comprehensive functional maps to date of the BRCA2 cancer risk gene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By testing&nbsp;nearly every&nbsp;possible change&nbsp;in this gene, Mayo Clinic researchers can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;which patients are more likely to&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from targeted cancer therapies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work reclassifies previously uncertain genetic test results, helping care teams individualize cancer screening,&nbsp;prevention&nbsp;and treatment. Together, it shows how Mayo Clinic is turning complex genetic data into information clinicians can use now, a central goal of&nbsp;precision medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's the extra step that makes the difference, helping people use the findings immediately," Dr. Couch says. "The results of our paper&nbsp;are used to help patients in the clinic. My entire career has been focused on getting information to patients as quickly as possible."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Dr. Couch continues to explore why certain inherited changes lead to cancer, why some families develop breast cancer without known risk&nbsp;genes&nbsp;and how discoveries in the lab can&nbsp;translate&nbsp;to improved&nbsp;care.&nbsp;Just this month,&nbsp;Dr. Couch won the prestigious Komen&nbsp;Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction in Basic Science&nbsp;for his significant work in advancing breast cancer research.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2514752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in the New England Journal of Medicine has uncovered that an off-the-shelf, dual-antibody therapy can generate deep and durable responses in extramedullary <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-myeloma/symptoms-causes/syc-20353378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple myeloma</a> — one of the most aggressive and treatment-resistant forms of the disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We are seeing powerful responses in a disease that historically has resisted every therapy," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kumar-shaji-m-d/bio-00027411" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaji Kumar, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> hematologist and senior author of the study. "By recruiting T cells in two distinct ways at once, this dual-target antibody strategy can generate responses in patients who have had very few effective options."&nbsp; </p>

<p>The approach combines two engineered antibodies, talquetamab and teclistamab, that simultaneously engage T cells and force them to attack myeloma cells through two separate immune pathways. Unlike CAR-T cell therapy, which requires custom manufacturing, this regimen is delivered as a standard infusion-center injection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a trial involving 90 patients, 79% responded to treatment, and 54% achieved no detectable disease by imaging or blood testing. Among responders, nearly two-thirds maintained disease control at one year, a striking improvement for a subtype that typically carries a months-long prognosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the first large, prospective study defined specifically by PET/MRI scan and focused exclusively on true extramedullary myeloma, not a mix of para- and extramedullary disease. Serious side effects were common. Infection was one serious side effect and underscores the importance of comprehensive supportive care alongside immunotherapy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next big questions are whether this dual-target strategy can be moved earlier in the disease course, how safety can be optimized further through infection monitoring and prevention, and whether similar "two-locks, one-key" immune designs can be applied to other hard-to-treat cancers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CHICAGO — GE HealthCare and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> today are announcing the GE HealthCare-Mayo Clinic Initiative in Radiation Therapy, known as GEMINI-RT, an ambitious new collaboration that aims to transform personalized radiation therapy and cancer care. Building on decades of collaboration and the Strategic Radiology Research Collaboration <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/about/newsroom/press-releases/mayo-clinic-and-ge-healthcare-enter-strategic-collaboration-to-advance-innovation-in-medical-imaging-and-theranostics?npclid=botnpclid&amp;srsltid=AfmBOopLgImTEsmRjcZdV7pKR51qxkmmySmli_s5XFnjp91QSxct9Va3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signed in 2023</a>, GEMINI-RT plans to drive innovation in prediction, planning, automation, workflow and monitoring for radiation oncology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>GEMINI-RT combines Mayo Clinic's world-class clinical and research expertise with GE HealthCare's leading technical and engineering innovation in oncology care and radiation therapy. The initiative aims to deliver comprehensive, personalized care by exploring integrating imaging, advanced therapies, dosimetry and patient monitoring at every step of the patient journey — from detection and diagnosis to treatment and follow-up.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Radiation therapy</a> is a cornerstone of cancer care, used in more than 50% of cases worldwide and for over 2 million U.S. patients annually<sup>1,2</sup>. The rising rates of new cancer diagnoses worldwide, with 19.3 million new cases in 2022, continues to drive demand for this treatment<sup>3</sup>. Through GEMINI-RT, Mayo Clinic and GE HealthCare aim to make personalized radiation therapy accessible by integrating streamlined, data-driven solutions that will leverage Mayo Clinic's clinical expertise and patient outcomes data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"GEMINI-RT is grounded in the concept of 'twinning the patient, personalizing the beam' — a transformative approach made possible by Mayo Clinic's extensive clinical expertise and outcomes data," said <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/traughber-bryan-j-m-d/bio-20542149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryan Traughber, M.D.</a>, vice chair of innovation for radiation oncology at Mayo Clinic. "The combination of research and technological acumen could allow us to model individual patient journeys with precision, enabling radiation therapy treatments that are truly tailored to each patient."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The collaboration will deepen efforts across four strategic areas:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Automation: </strong>Collaborating on AI-powered solutions to eliminate repetitive tasks and accelerate treatment planning.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Predictive oncology: </strong>Harnessing clinical insights to personalize cancer treatment decisions and improve outcomes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Multimodal therapies: </strong>Exploring approaches that combine radiation with emerging treatments like targeted drugs and precision heating for more effective care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Connected care: </strong>Using AI, biomarkers and sensors to monitor patients beyond the clinic — with the aim of predicting side effects early and supporting treatment at home.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>"This effort enables us to collaborate on solutions that are not only leading-edge but also clinically meaningful, helping shape the future of personalized radiation therapy. By integrating innovative technology and AI across the care continuum, we can improve clinician experience, support high-quality patient care and help reduce burnout among care teams," said Dr. Ben Newton, global head of oncology for GE Healthcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>GEMINI-RT research and activities will be based at Mayo Clinic's campus in Rochester, Minnesota, leveraging both organizations' strengths in clinical practice, research and product development. This initiative will build on the accomplishments of 2023 Strategic Radiology Research Collaboration in which GE HealthCare and Mayo Clinic are collaborating on projects in advanced magnetic resonance (MR) technologies and techniques, theranostics treatment for cancer, and diagnostic and interventional ultrasound.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — For many people living with cancer, symptoms such as pain, anxiety or insomnia can quickly spiral into an emergency room visit. Such visits can be financially costly and take an emotional toll on patients and their caregivers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1470204525005261?dgcid=author" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers found that using digital check-ins and a remote care team can help patients manage symptoms before they reach a crisis point. </p>



<p>"Our goal was simple but ambitious," says study lead <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cheville-andrea-l-m-d/bio-20054964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea Cheville, M.D.</a>, professor of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. "We wanted to see if automating symptom check-ins and care through the electronic health record could improve patients' lives without adding to the burden on oncology teams. What we found is that this approach not only eased symptoms like anxiety and depression but also kept thousands of patients out of the hospital. That tells us technology can help us successfully extend the reach and efficacy of care."&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Becky Johnson, participating in the Enhanced EHR-Facilitated Cancer Symptom Control Trial (E2C2) meant better sleep — despite the anxiety she felt about her double breast cancer diagnosis in 2022 at the age of 40.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I was continually Googling for more information about treatments, prognosis, new terminology and the experiences of others. And the steroid medications I took for treatment prior to chemo messed with my ability to sleep, too. It got to a point where my body's norm was to wake in the middle of the night and not fall back asleep, taking a toll on my ability to heal," says Johnson, program director for the Mayo Clinic School of Health Sciences Sonography Program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As part of the trial, Johnson regularly submitted digital surveys about various aspects of her health. Insomnia quickly rose to the top, prompting a phone call from a nurse, who counseled Johnson on ways to get a better night's rest. The nurse also gave Johnson a link to a self-paced online class with sleep strategies based in cognitive behavioral therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"A virtual or phone call visit, especially when I didn't have anything physically wrong, was so convenient and efficient," says Johnson. The intervention helped, and her sleep improved.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make such interventions possible, the researchers developed automations in the Plummer Chart, the software system that manages patients' electronic health records (EHRs) and helps Mayo teams coordinate care. Between 2019 and 2023, just over 50,200 patients across 15 cancer specialties at Mayo Clinic enrolled in the E2C2 trial. Like Johnson, they filled out short surveys about pain, fatigue, sleep, anxiety and other symptoms before clinic visits or monthly between visits. The system automatically sorted their responses. Mild scores were simply logged, moderate ones triggered the system to send the patient self-care tips, and severe scores prompted outreach by a remote symptom care manager — a nurse or social worker who could work with patients via phone or video.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Behind the scenes, the software became both an automated traffic controller and safety net. For care teams, it routed information to patients automatically so they could focus on the work that required their expertise. For patients, it made getting support easier, with no additional appointments or travel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The trial results showed that the automated surveys and responses built into the EHR made care more efficient and, ultimately, improved patients' symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Patients reported less anxiety and depression, with modest improvements in other symptoms.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Patients had 40% to 60% fewer acute care encounters, including emergency visits, hospitalizations, and ICU admissions.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>All of this was achieved with just 2-3 full-time care managers plus 20 percent of one physician's time supporting more than 50,000 study participants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The E2C2 trial showcases a new approach to using digital tools in cancer care. By automating routine monitoring and triaging of patient symptoms and well-being through the patient's electronic health record, a small care team can support a large patient population.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The gains we saw are encouraging and point to a scalable way to extend supportive oncology care beyond the clinic walls, meeting patients where they are," says Dr. Cheville. "The next step is to ensure that these tools are available to healthcare teams, enabling them to efficiently reach every patient who needs supportive care."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The E2C2 trial was funded by the National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute (NCI) as part of the Cancer Moonshot℠.
