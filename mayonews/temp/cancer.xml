<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers and collaborators have identified a previously unrecognized way lung tumors weaken the immune system, helping explain why many patients do not respond to immunotherapy and pointing to a potential new approach to make those treatments more effective.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/doi/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-25-0567/771882/Regulatory-T-cell-sensing-of-extracellular-ATP-via" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology Research</a>, focuses on regulatory T cells, immune cells that normally keep the immune system from becoming overactive. In <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>, researchers found these same cells can be redirected to protect the tumor instead of the body.</p>



<p>"What we are seeing is the tumor taking advantage of a normal immune safety mechanism and turning it to its own benefit," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/borges-da-silva-henrique-ph-d/bio-20492923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henrique Borges da Silva, Ph.D.</a>, an immunologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a> and senior author of the study. "The same cells that normally prevent immune damage are instead protecting the tumor."</p>



<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although immunotherapies have improved outcomes for some patients, many tumors continue to grow because immune cells cannot function effectively inside the tumor environment.</p>



<p>To better understand why, the researchers analyzed patient data from non-small cell lung cancer. They found that regulatory T cells inside lung tumors expressed high levels of P2RX7, and higher P2RX7 expression was linked to worse survival outcomes.</p>



<p>P2RX7 allows regulatory T cells to sense ATP, a molecule released by stressed cells and commonly found at high levels inside tumors. When these cells detect ATP, they accumulate within lung tumors and suppress immune cells that would otherwise attack the cancer.</p>



<p>When P2RX7 was removed from regulatory T cells, lung tumors grew more slowly because the immune system was less suppressed. Immune cells that attack cancer were able to move into tumors more easily and were more active.</p>



<p>The study also found that P2RX7 helps regulatory T cells produce CTLA-4, a molecule that dampens immune responses. Without P2RX7, these regulatory cells were less effective at shutting down immune activity inside lung tumors.</p>



<p>Blocking P2RX7 also helped immune cells work more closely with B cells. This led to higher levels of antibodies that target tumors and to the formation of organized immune cell groups inside tumors, which have been associated with better outcomes in lung cancer.</p>



<p>"If we want immunotherapy to reach more patients, we have to understand why it fails," Dr. Borges da Silva says. "This study identifies one of the mechanisms standing in the way."</p>



<p>The researchers also tested a drug that inhibits P2RX7. They found that the inhibitor developed smaller lung tumors in models and had fewer regulatory T cells inside the tumors. While the drug is not yet approved for cancer treatment, the findings suggest it could one day be used alongside existing immunotherapies.</p>



<p>Researchers say more studies are needed before the findings can be tested in patients, but the work highlights how targeting immune suppression inside tumors could help make cancer treatments more effective.</p>

<p><em>February is Heart Month</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — As <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer therapies</a> improve and increasingly achieve cures or recurring periods of remission, preventing and managing damage to organs from cancer treatment has become a top concern. That includes injury to the heart, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/herrmann-joerg-m-d/bio-20143025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joerg Herrmann, M.D.</a>, a cardiologist and the founder and director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cardio-oncology-clinic/overview/ovc-20442193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardio-Oncology Clinic</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Minnesota.</p>



<p>As physicians and researchers work to prevent, diagnose and treat heart damage from cancer therapies, they also have learned about connections between cancer and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the heart</a> that go beyond the cardiac effects of cancer treatments. Dr. Herrmann shares three things to know:</p>



<p><strong>1. There is a "web of risk factors."</strong></p>



<p>Cancer and heart disease have common risk factors, Dr. Herrmann says. Those include lifestyle habits.</p>



<p>"We call it the web of risk factors. Some of the very same lifestyle-related factors can set patients up for both <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/in-depth/heart-disease-prevention/art-20046502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular disease</a>," he explains. "<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/a-smokers-guide-to-quitting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Smoking</a> is a prime example. It increases the risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung</a> and other cancers and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coronary artery disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">peripheral artery disease</a>."</p>



<p>In addition to not smoking, you can reduce your risk of cancer and of heart disease by achieving a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20375749" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy weight</a>; avoiding or moderating alcohol use; controlling <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholesterol</a> (some cancer treatments can worsen cholesterol levels); getting enough <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep</a>; and adopting a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/basics/nutrition-basics/hlv-20049477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy diet</a> with fruit and vegetables, he adds.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer-survivor/art-20044015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physical activity</a> is another important factor. It has been shown to reduce heart damage risk during cancer treatment, help prevent cancer recurrence and improve cardiovascular outcomes, Dr. Herrmann says.</p>



<p>"The more elements of a healthy lifestyle you meet, the better your health projection is for the heart and cancer," he says. "You will reduce the risks of two of the leading killers and increase life expectancy."</p>



<p>Cancer and heart disease can actually be risk factors <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000001303?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for each other</a>.</p>



<p>"We've realized that the relationship between cancer and heart disease works in both directions," Dr. Herrmann says. "Cancer itself can impact the cardiovascular system apart from cancer therapies, and vice versa. Patients with heart failure or other cardiovascular diseases have a higher risk of cancer."</p>



<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>A variety of things may be done during cancer treatment to reduce risk to the heart.</strong></p>



<p>Which treatments are given and how can affect the risk of heart damage, Dr. Herrmann says. For example, the medical team may:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Use treatments that minimize harm to healthy tissue, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cancer-treatment/about/pac-20393344" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeted therapies</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/sections/overview/ovc-20185491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>.</li>



<li>Stagger certain chemotherapy drugs to give the heart a chance to heal between treatments.</li>



<li>Use medications that protect the heart during <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>.</li>



<li>Use techniques to shield healthy tissue during <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20385164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation therapy</a>, such as body positioning and breath-holding to provide greater separation between the tumor and the heart.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>"These shielding efforts have come a long way for adults and children who have cancer," he says.</p>



<p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Artificial intelligence and wearables are promising innovations.</strong></p>



<p>The goals of Dr. Herrmann's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/faculty-search-results?authid=13597311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a> including developing tools that predict – before treatment – who is at high risk of heart damage from certain cancer therapies. This would enable shared decision making among patients and their care teams about the approach to treatment.</p>



<p>He and his colleagues are also working on therapies to mend hearts broken by chemotherapy and to develop easier and more cost-effective surveillance strategies for cardiovascular side effects of cancer therapies. Early detection and intervention are likely to lead to the best outcomes, Dr. Herrmann says.</p>



<p>The use of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-transforms-smartwatch-ecg-signals-into-a-diagnostic-tool-for-heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wearables</a> and artificial intelligence (AI) can help, he says. Research has found, for example, that <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-study-suggests-ecg-ai-can-detect-cardiovascular-disease-risks-sooner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">applying AI</a> to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram</a>, a test that measures the heart's electrical activity, may help detect a decline in heart function.</p>



<p>"We're interested in going further with AI technologies and developing simulations to show how different therapies would affect a given patient," Dr. Herrmann says.</p>



<p>Some patients remain at risk of heart disease for a lifetime after cancer treatment, but it's impractical to do <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiograms</a> to look at the heart for the rest of their lives. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ai-transforms-smartwatch-ecg-signals-into-a-diagnostic-tool-for-heart-failure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wearables</a> to alert cancer survivors and their care teams to cardiac abnormalities are another promising area of research, he says.</p>



<p>"We've come a long way in cardio-oncology. We have a much better understanding of what we can do to manage heart risk from cancer therapies," Dr. Herrmann says. "Patients are in much better place now than they were even 10 years ago."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> collaborated with <a href="https://newphase.co.il/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Phase Ltd.</a> to install the first magnetic nanoparticle-mediated hyperthermia machine for cancer research in the U.S. <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/types/hyperthermia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyperthermia</a> is a procedure that uses heat to damage and kill cancer cells. The investigational machine will support research evaluating the safety, feasibility and potential effectiveness of this approach in cancer treatment.</p>



<p>"We have known for more than a century that temperature is the Achilles' heel of cancer, but conventional hyperthermia has limitations and is not widely available," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lester-scott-c-m-d/bio-20473427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scott Lester, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. "The hyperthermia technology we've installed is still investigational but may enable us to harness heat in a novel way for advanced cancers, and we're grateful to be the first to use it in our research."</p>



<p>The investigational hyperthermia machine is an electromagnetic induction system that targets the torso. Doctors first administer iron oxide-containing magnetic nanoparticles through an IV, allowing them to collect in tumors. The care team then positions the patient in the machine, where electromagnetic waves heat the tumors to help destroy cancer cells.</p>



<p>"It works like an induction cooktop," Dr. Lester explains. Induction cooktops require special pans to interact with the device. Instead of pans, the tumor absorbs the nanoparticles, effectively turning it into an induction pan. When alternating magnetic fields pulse the pan, it creates heat. A special coating on the nanoparticles limits the temperature to no more than 50 degrees Celsius. The care team also places cooling blankets on patients to keep their body temperature from rising too high and monitors them closely. The hope is that this controlled heating can damage the tumor to slow or stop its growth.</p>



<p>New Phase Ltd. manufactures both the hyperthermia machine and the nanoparticles. Mayo Clinic installed the machine within the Radiation Oncology Department in the Jacobson Building at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. The team completed the installation in November 2025. The first U.S. patient then received hyperthermia as part of a clinical trial in December 2025.</p>



<p>In the clinical trial, researchers are administering the investigational therapy to metastatic solid tumors in any body area except the brain. The investigational therapy can be administered to multiple tumors simultaneously and to cancers that are deep in the body. "We are focusing on patients whose cancers are resistant to multiple lines of systemic therapies and other advanced treatments, including radiotherapy," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/park-sean-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Park, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, radiation oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and co-principal investigator of the trial with Dr. Lester.</p>



<p>"Science has taught us that hyperthermia may be the ultimate sidekick for these treatments," Dr. Lester adds. "We aim for hyperthermia to be the fourth leg of cancer treatment, giving us a different angle to attack cancer and help patients." Researchers also plan to study hyperthermia in combination with other treatments, such as radiation. Combination therapy could allow for lower radiation doses with the same effectiveness or improve outcomes in radiation-resistant tumors.</p>



<p>"The research collaboration between New Phase Ltd. and Mayo Clinic aims to open new treatment possibilities for metastatic cancer patients who currently have limited options," says Ofer Shalev, CEO and co-founder of New Phase Ltd.</p>



<p>Twenty years ago, Mayo Clinic radiation oncologists used ultrasound to heat water-filled bags that were placed on patients' skin, often on the chest wall of women who had recurrent breast cancer after surgery and radiation. "We added the heat to enhance the effects of radiation, and there were times it was very successful," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/laack-nadia-n-m-d/bio-20054933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadia Laack, M.D.</a>, chair of Radiation Oncology at Mayo Clinic. However, the water bag temperature was unreliable, and patients could experience pain, causing the technique to fall out of favor. Other studies showing the benefits of hyperthermia combined with radiation were also limited by technological constraints.</p>



<p>"Now, we may have a more advanced method to reintroduce hyperthermia into cancer therapy," Dr. Laack says. "If we can demonstrate its effectiveness, we can make hyperthermia more widely available to help patients with complex cancers."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A medication commonly used to treat overactive bladder significantly reduced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hot-flashes/symptoms-causes/syc-20352790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot flashes</a> in men receiving hormone therapy for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a>, according to a study published in the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO-25-01486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a> which included several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers.</p>



<p>The phase 2 study found that oxybutynin, a medication commonly prescribed to treat overactive bladder, worked better than a placebo at reducing how often hot flashes occurred and how intense they were in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Men who took oxybutynin also reported improvements in their day-to-day functioning and overall quality of life.</p>



<p>Hot flashes affect an estimated 60% to 80% of men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy and can interfere with sleep, mood and overall well-being. For some patients, these symptoms are severe enough to make it difficult to continue treatment.</p>

<p>"Hot flashes are often underestimated in men, but they can have a real and lasting impact on quality of life during prostate cancer treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stish-brad-j-m-d/bio-20340352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Stish, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "This trial shows that oxybutynin can provide significant relief with a favorable safety profile."</p>



<p>The study enrolled 88 men with prostate cancer who were experiencing frequent hot flashes while receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oxybutynin at one of two doses or a placebo for six weeks.</p>



<p>Men who received the higher dose of oxybutynin experienced the greatest benefit, with an average reduction of nearly seven hot flashes per day, compared with about two fewer hot flashes per day in the placebo group. More than 75% of men receiving the higher dose achieved at least a 50% reduction in hot flash severity.</p>



<p>Patients taking oxybutynin also reported less disruption to sleep, work, social activities and overall quality of life. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred during the study. The most common side effect was dry mouth, which was more frequent at higher doses.</p>



<p>Oxybutynin has previously been shown to reduce hot flashes in women, but evidence in men had been limited. This trial is among the first randomized, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate its effectiveness for men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy.</p>



<p>"These results expand the options available to clinicians and patients who are trying to manage a challenging side effect of prostate cancer treatment," says Dr. Stish. "Having additional, well-tolerated choices matters."</p>



<p>Researchers note that larger studies will be needed to confirm the findings and determine the optimal dose, but the results support the use of oxybutynin as a treatment option for men with bothersome hot flashes related to hormone therapy.</p>



<p>The study was conducted through the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, part of the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trial Network. It included participants from academic and community cancer centers across the U.S. Mayo Clinic has a financial interest in the technology referenced in this news release.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt8706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers suggests that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a> cells quickly activate a survival response after PARP inhibitor treatment, and blocking this early response may make this class of drugs work better.</p>



<p>PARP inhibitors are a common treatment for ovarian cancer and can be especially effective in cancers with impaired DNA repair. However, many tumors eventually stop responding, even when the drugs initially show results. The new research identifies a way cancer cells may survive PARP inhibitor treatment early on, and it points to a potential strategy to block that response.</p>



<p>In the study, researchers found that ovarian cancer cells rapidly activate a pro-survival program after exposure to PARP inhibitors. A key driver of this response is FRA1, a transcription factor that helps turn on genes that allow cancer cells to adapt and avoid cell death.</p>



<p>"This work shows that drug resistance does not always emerge slowly over time — cancer cells can activate survival programs very early after treatment begins," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kanakkanthara-arun-ph-d/bio-20445738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arun Kanakkanthara, Ph.D.</a>, an oncology investigator at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. "By targeting that early response, we may be able to improve how well existing therapies work and potentially delay or prevent resistance."</p>



<p>The research team tested whether brigatinib, an FDA-approved drug currently used to treat certain lung cancers, could block this survival response and enhance the effects of PARP inhibitors. Brigatinib was selected because of its ability to inhibit multiple signaling pathways involved in cancer cell survival.</p>



<p>The results showed that combining brigatinib with a PARP inhibitor was more effective than either treatment alone. Importantly, this effect was seen only in cancer cells, not in normal cells, suggesting the potential for a more targeted and safer treatment approach.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that brigatinib helps in a completely new way. Rather than acting through traditional DNA repair pathways, brigatinib shuts down two key signaling molecules, FAK and EPHA2, that aggressive ovarian cancer cells rely on to survive. Blocking both signals at once weakened the cancer cells' ability to adapt and resist treatment, leaving them far more vulnerable to PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>The researchers also found a potential clue for identifying which patients might benefit most from this treatment. Tumors with higher levels of the signaling molecules FAK and EPHA2 responded better to the drug combination. Other data suggest that ovarian cancers with high levels of these molecules are often more aggressive, highlighting the promise of this approach for harder-to-treat cases.</p>



<p>"From a clinical perspective, resistance remains one of the biggest challenges in treating ovarian cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/weroha-john-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Weroha, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. "By combining mechanistic insights from Dr. Kanakkanthara's laboratory with my clinical experience, this preclinical work supports the strategy of targeting resistance early, before it has a chance to take hold. This strategy could improve patient outcomes."</p>



<p>This research sheds new light on how ovarian cancer evades treatment, and it points to a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic announced today additional capabilities within <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/orchestrate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform_Orchestrate</a> that make it more efficient for researchers to access standardized, real-world cancer data from Mayo Clinic and participating <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/focus-areas/healthcare-providers/connect/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform_Connect</a> partners. This gives researchers the ability to generate insights that can accelerate cancer research and improve patient care.</p>



<p>Developing new cancer therapies is a long and complex process that typically takes many years. Orchestrate's capabilities can help shorten this timeline by giving researchers faster access to high-quality, real-world cancer data.</p>



<p>Orchestrate is now using an industry-leading, standardized framework to organize complex cancer information, known as Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Oncology. The new function can present de-identified data in a consistent, structured and research-ready format. This includes standardized information such as tumor characteristics, biomarkers, staging, treatments, progression and outcomes. These key oncology attributes are refined from a rich background of structured data (e.g., diagnoses, lab test results) and unstructured data (e.g., imaging, pathology and radiology reports) already integrated on Mayo Clinic Platform to enable better clinical insights and research.</p>



<p>The OMOP Oncology model is a product of the global <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)</a> initiative. The model's standardized structureallows researchers to analyze complex cancer data more rapidly, accurately and on a larger scale than before.</p>



<p>"The integration of OMOP Oncology into Mayo Clinic Platform has the power to accelerate discovery, improve clinical trial design, unlock real-world insights and support the development of next-generation therapies for patients worldwide," said <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heath-elisabeth-i-m-d/bio-20576547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elisabeth Heath, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Oncology at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nemesis.health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nemesis&amp;nbsp;Health</a>,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;research&amp;nbsp;and technology service&amp;nbsp;provider&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;Mayo&amp;nbsp;Clinic Platform, contributed to the development of OMOP Oncology capabilities on Orchestrate.</p>



<p>This year, Mayo Clinic Platform will also incorporate tokenization, a technology that connects de-identified information from across a patient's care experience to provide a more complete, longitudinal view of their healthcare journey. Combined with the OMOP Oncology model, this will give researchers a more comprehensive understanding of a patient's cancer care pathway before, during and after their care at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-launches-mayo-clinic-platform_orchestrate-to-get-new-therapies-to-patients-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Launched</a> in 2025, Orchestrate builds on Mayo Clinic Platform's <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/discover/#data-sets" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trusted data ecosystem</a> that offers a secure and reliable environment for research and innovation. With these enhanced capabilities, researchers and others seeking to solve healthcare challenges can more easily identify and analyze key groups of people who share common characteristics, understand treatment and outcome patterns, assess the feasibility of clinical trials, and generate real-world evidence to support the development of new cancer therapies.</p>



<p>"Orchestrate strengthens Mayo Clinic's commitment to advancing cancer care through data-driven innovation," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/about/team/maneesh-goyal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maneesh Goyal</a>, chief operating officer, Mayo Clinic Platform. "By combining trusted data, advanced artificial intelligence and Mayo Clinic’s scientific expertise, these capabilities help unlock deeper insights, accelerate research and ultimately, bring new therapies to patients faster."</p>

</div>


<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A Mayo Clinic study is providing new insights into how treatment sequence can affect survival in patients with early-stage&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a>, suggesting that many patients may benefit from receiving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> before surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings, published in the <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjnccn.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fjnccn%2F24%2F2%2Farticle-p27.xml&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeboom.Emily%40mayo.edu%7Cdae0a8e36f874fed8dfe08de65c3612b%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C639060086987855425%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=1X5dHNT9bLW58K54krBrpu%2BWUZQn3PNMQ1ZnTalwdqo%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JNCCN<em>—</em>Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>, were based on more than 1,400 patients treated across <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's campuses</a> in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida. Researchers found that when pancreatic tumors were in contact with the superior mesenteric vein — a major blood vessel by the pancreas — patients who underwent surgery first experienced reduced survival rates. In contrast, patients who received chemotherapy before surgery had similar survival outcomes to those whose tumors were not touching the vein.</p>



<p>"Many patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer undergo surgery first because it is historically believed to be the best chance for cure," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fong-zhi-ven-m-d-dr-ph/bio-20555871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhi Ven Fong, M.D., Dr.PH.</a>, surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and co-senior author of the study. "Our findings suggest that chemotherapy first, even in cases thought to be more straightforward, provides patients with the best opportunity for long-term survival."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancreatic cancer</a> is notoriously aggressive, and progress over the past decade to increase patient survival has been limited. Chemotherapy before surgery, called neoadjuvant chemotherapy, aims to shrink the tumor and target cancer cells that may have spread. This approach increases the chance of complete tumor removal during an operation and improves survival outcomes.</p>



<p>"Our data confirms what we've seen in practice at Mayo Clinic for years," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/truty-mark-j-m-d-m-s/bio-20055639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Truty, M.D.</a>, surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and co-senior author. "The timing of surgery relative to chemotherapy is critically important for patient outcomes."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rethinking pancreatic tumor classification</strong></h2>



<p>The study also highlights opportunities to refine how pancreatic cancer is classified. Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network categorize tumors by how much they touch certain critical blood vessels. Those with less than 180 degrees on the vein are considered upfront resectable, meaning surgery should be performed right away without chemotherapy first. Mayo Clinic's data suggest that these patients may do better if chemotherapy is considered before surgery.</p>



<p>"Our findings suggest that guidelines could be updated to reclassify tumors with any vein involvement as borderline resectable and to only include cancers with no vein involvement as upfront resectable," says Dr. Fong.</p>



<p>The findings reinforce Mayo Clinic's approach, which already prioritizes chemotherapy before surgery for all pancreatic cancer patients, regardless of stage. Researchers believe this evidence will encourage continued discussion within the oncology community and support thoughtful refinements to national treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>"Our hope is that this study empowers both patients and clinicians to think carefully about treatment sequencing," says Dr. Truty. "We want people to know they have options, and that starting with chemotherapy may be the best path forward."</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>My husband has been diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>. I know his treatment will be hard on him, and I want to help in any way with his diet. What do you recommend for us?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Cancer treatments can take a toll on a person's body. Your husband's treatment may cause nausea, changes in appetite, taste and smell, diarrhea, or constipation, making it harder to meet his nutritional needs. Fortunately, there are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20045046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategies</a> you can use to cope with these side effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting nutrition during cancer treatment</h2>



<p><strong>Weight changes.&nbsp;</strong>Weight changes are common. Weight loss without trying can reduce muscle mass, stamina and quality of life. Weight gain can lead to the development of other diseases, like diabetes or heart disease. Try to maintain your weight during treatment, even if it's outside a normal range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Appetite changes.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Cancer and cancer treatment may make you lose your appetite or eat more than usual.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you lose your appetite:&amp;nbsp;<ul><li>Eat smaller snacks that are high in calories, including yogurt, nuts, peanut butter and avocado.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Eat more when your appetite is better.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Food may sound unappealing even when you're hungry, making it difficult to eat. Try to find something that's appetizing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep snacks on hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>If you eat more when stressed:<ul><li>Choose snacks such as fruits, vegetables and popcorn.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find ways to manage stress without food, such as going for a walk or calling a friend.&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Nausea.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Feeling sick or throwing up due to your treatments makes it hard to eat. Small changes to what and how you eat may help you feel better.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat foods that are easy on your stomach, such as crackers, toast, broth or broth-based soups, ice pops, hard candies, plain pasta and rice.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Eat five or six small meals a day. Smaller meals are often easier to keep down.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Don't skip meals or snacks. Even when you're not hungry, try to eat; an empty stomach can make nausea worse.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Sip small amounts of fluid during meals and throughout the day.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Try pretzels or crackers with your medicines if your care team says it's OK.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Taste and smell changes.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Cancer treatment can alter the taste or smell of food. Some people say food tastes bland. Others say it tastes metallic or too sweet or salty. You may need to try different foods to find what works for you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To help with taste changes:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Brighten the flavor. Add a little lemon, lime or vinegar unless your mouth is sore.</li>



<li>Try strong flavors. Use spices such as cinnamon, ginger, basil or rosemary.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Make foods sweeter. Add sugar or another sweetener if food tastes bitter or sour.</li>



<li>Use marinades before cooking.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Choose other proteins. If meat doesn't taste good, try beans, nuts or fish.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Use plastic or bamboo utensils. These may help if food tastes metallic.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Try new foods. You won't have expectations about the taste.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>To help with strong smells:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cook food in the microwave or use a crockpot or instant cooker in the garage.</li>



<li>Eat foods cold or at room temperature.</li>



<li>Cover food while it cooks.</li>



<li>Use a window or fan to help remove unpleasant odors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Drink from a covered cup.</li>



<li>Ask a friend to cook for you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Sore throat, mouth or trouble swallowing.&amp;nbsp;</strong>When your throat is sore or it's hard to swallow, eating may be painful or tiring. These tips can help:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Soften the texture. Opt for smooth foods, such as cooked cereal, mashed potatoes or scrambled eggs.</li>



<li>Cool things down. Choose smoothies, ice pops or a bowl of ice cream.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Take smaller bites and cut food into tiny pieces.</li>



<li>Avoid what bothers you. Spicy, sour, crunchy or vinegar-based foods, citrus fruits, tomato sauce or carbonated beverages can cause discomfort.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Suck on ice chips or ice pops.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Diarrhea and constipation.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Bowel changes are unpleasant but common side effects of cancer treatment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To help with diarrhea:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat small, frequent meals and snacks.</li>



<li>Choose soft, low-fiber foods.</li>



<li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol.</li>



<li>Limit lactose found in milk and yogurt.</li>



<li>Avoid sugar substitutes such as sorbitol, xylitol or mannitol, which are often found in sugar-free candy or gum.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Drink plenty of fluids, including electrolyte-containing fluids, to stay hydrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>For constipation, aim to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Drink enough fluid to stay hydrated and keep stools soft. Try to drink eight to 10 cups of water each day. Warm coffee, tea or broth-based soup in the morning can help your bowels move. Use the bathroom when you feel the urge.</li>



<li>Move your body. Even short walks help your digestive system work better.</li>



<li>Keep regular mealtimes.</li>



<li>Eat a high-fiber diet.<br><br></li>
</ul>



<p>Your husband's care team is an excellent resource for what you can expect during treatment and for the symptoms that may affect his diet and weight.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> is expanding surgical options for patients undergoing treatment or risk reducing procedures for breast cancer through the adoption of robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy at its Minnesota and Florida campuses. Following recent Food and Drug Administration approval of the use of this platform and device for these procedures, Mayo Clinic surgeons are now offering a minimally invasive approach designed to improve cosmetic outcomes, preserve skin and nipple viability, and broaden opportunities for potential sensory restoration.</p>



<p>Nipple-sparing mastectomy preserves the nipple–areolar complex and healthy breast skin, creating a more natural appearing reconstructed breast after reconstruction. The improved cosmetic result can offer meaningful psychological benefits for patients compared with traditional mastectomy. Many patients, however, continue to experience visible scarring, diminished or absent sensation in the breast and nipple, and risk of loss of nipple or skin due to low blood flow.</p>



<p>The robotic approach provides a way to address some of these challenges by enabling a small, lateral incision, gentle tissue retraction with gas insufflation, and enhanced visualization of the surgical field. Mayo Clinic surgeons also are integrating sensory restoring procedures in some cases, including neurotization (reinnervation) of the nipple–areolar complex, to help patients regain protective sensation of their reconstructed breasts.</p>



<p>"When we remove the breast tissue and keep the envelope of the breast skin and nipple, it provides the most natural-appearing breast from a cosmetic standpoint," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/piltin-mara-a-d-o/bio-20487425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mara Piltin, D.O.</a>, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. "The next step is to improve the process so that patients regain feeling in their breasts and are not constantly seeing scars that remind them of their cancer journey. It will positively impact their sexual health, self-image and recovery."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic continues to lead in NSM innovation, consistently refining surgical techniques and expanding clinical trials to enhance patient outcomes. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-jeffrey-e-m-d/bio-20519730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey E. Johnson, M.D.</a>, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, explains, "At Mayo Clinic, our goal is to ensure that more patients can benefit from innovations that support not only their physical recovery but also their emotional well-being so every patient can move forward with confidence and hope."</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Our neighbors were selling their home and had it tested for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/radon-the-odorless-invisible-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radon</a>. The test was positive. Why should we be concerned about radon, and should we have our home tested too?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>The positive test for radon in your neighbors' home has given you a heads-up that your home should be tested as well.</p>



<p>Radon is an odorless, invisible radioactive gas. It's naturally released from rocks, soil and water — and it can get trapped inside your home, office or school. There's no known safe level of radon. Unfortunately, there are no symptoms associated with radon exposure, unlike with carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why radon is so dangerous</strong></h2>



<p>Breathing high levels of radon over time can lead to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>&amp;nbsp;since this gas is a Class A carcinogen. It's the No. 1 cause of lung cancer in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/connected-care/can-you-get-lung-cancer-if-youve-never-smoked/cpt-20413370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonsmokers</a> and the second-leading cause of lung&amp;nbsp;cancer overall. Nationwide, 21,000 people die from radon-caused lung cancer each year.</p>



<p>Smoking and secondhand smoke, combined with exposure to high radon levels, increase your risk of lung cancer. If you or your family are experiencing breathing issues, consult with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-cancer-screening/about/pac-20385024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonologist</a>.</p>



<p>Radon can be found in any home — old or new — and typically enters through cracks in the foundation caused by natural settling and windows. Radon levels often are higher in lower levels and basements. Across the U.S., 1 in 15 homes have elevated radon levels, and levels are higher in the Midwest. For example, radon levels range from 4.7 picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L) in Indiana to 9.6 pCi/L in North Dakota. The nationwide average is 1.3 pCi/L.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing for radon</strong></h2>



<p>There's a simple solution to this close-to-home health hazard: testing. That's what the Environmental Protection Agency urges all homeowners to do, especially those in high-radon areas. Testing is the only way to determine the radon level in your home.</p>

</div>


<p>You can find radon testing kits at hardware or other home maintenance stores and online. They cost around $20 or less and are easy to use. It typically takes two to seven days for results. Although there's no safe level of radon, look for test results of 4.0 pCi/L or less.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If your home tests higher than 4.0 pCi/L, then you'll need to have a professional&amp;nbsp;fix the radon issue, which includes installing venting equipment. The equipment looks like a big tube that reaches below the foundation&amp;nbsp;of your home and vents radon up and out of the house.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The cost of a radon mitigation system varies according to the size and design of your home, as well as the system being installed. Costs average $1,000-$2,000. Check with your local city and county housing agencies to see if they have funds available for low-interest loans or grants for radon mitigation, and learn if you're eligible for these funds.</p>



<p>Once the mitigation system has been installed, your home should be tested again to make sure the fix is effective. Even if your home passes the first test, you should retest every two years.</p>



<p>Also, radon testing isn't required when selling a home. However, if you're a buyer, you should insist on it. If levels are high, you may be able to negotiate the costs of the mitigation with the seller.</p>



<p>Radon testing and mitigation are investments in your home — and in your health.</p>
