<p>Curtis Jackson was living his dream life — a loving and supportive wife, three wonderful kids, and a future that looked as bright as could be.</p>



<p>Then, one day, without warning, the dream was shattered.</p>



<p>At only 46, Curtis was diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408">cholangiocarcinoma</a>, one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of cancer. It's a silent killer that strikes the liver. It is often diagnosed in later stages, leaving patients with few treatment options and little time to live.</p>



<p>The Jackson family turned to Mayo Clinic, where a team of experts fought the cancer with a weapon rarely used in the battle against this aggressive form of cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Years before his cancer diagnosis, Curtis was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)</a>. PSC is a chronic liver disease that causes inflammation and scarring to the bile ducts, which work with the liver to help with digestion.</p>



<p>PSC put the Arizona man at higher risk for liver cancer, requiring him to get regular diagnostic screenings. As with most forms of cancer, but particularly cholangiocarcinoma, doctors say early detection is key to improving patient outcomes.</p>



<p>However, with cholangiocarcinoma, there are often no warning signs or symptoms alerting patients of the need to consult with their doctor about getting screened, until it's too late. In Curtis' case, the cholangiocarcinoma was detected in one of his routine screenings at Mayo Clinic, which doctors say likely helped save his life.</p>

<p>"It's a very rare cancer that tends to grow unnoticed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bekaii-saab-tanios-s-m-d/bio-20413464">Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab</a>, an oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</a>. "If the cancer gets to the point where it's too advanced for surgery or transplantation, universally this is a noncurative or noncurable cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare weapon</strong></h2>



<p>Doctors say a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant </a>can sometimes be an option for some patients. However, not many transplant centers perform liver transplants on patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Mayo Clinic is one of the few centers that do offer liver transplantation for some patients who meet certain criteria.</p>



<p>In Curtis' case, doctors at Mayo Clinic determined a liver transplant was his best chance for survival.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We're not just here treating the cancer. We're also treating the disease that led to the cancer."</p><cite>Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It is a unique form of therapy that is based on research that started at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093">Dr. Aqel Bashar</a>, director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<p>"We developed some protocols that helped us improve the outcome of transplant in these patients, and without these protocols, a lot of patients with this type of cancer would not make it to transplant," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Mayo Clinic's ability to offer this curative option for rare cancers like this has differentiated us from many other transplant centers."</p><cite>Dr. Bashar Aqel, Director, Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Curtis first underwent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a> at Mayo Clinic. He was then placed on the liver transplant waiting list for a donor organ. While waiting, Curtis says he kept his focus on his family.</p>



<p>"I spent all the time I could with my wife and kids, like basketball practices, homework, anything we could do to help our kids," says Curtis.</p>



<p>When Curtis got the call a donor organ was found, he immediately reported to Mayo Clinic to undergo his lifesaving liver transplant. The surgery was a success. Four weeks later, Curtis was back at home with family recovering well and feeling a deep sense of gratitude for his organ donor and his team at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>"Thank you because now I get to see my daughters get married, go to college, I get to see my son live his dreams and go to college and get married," says Curtis. "I get to live and grow old with my wife. I can't say this enough to everyone, 'thank you.'"</p>

<p>"We're already observing excellent function from Curtis' new liver, with the majority of his liver tests returning normal results," says Dr. Aqel. "His recovery has been remarkably swift and impressive."</p>



<p>"A lot of love goes out to the people in that family," says Gwyn Jackson, Curtis' oldest daughter in reference to the organ donor's family. "They allowed us to have our dad back and we're so grateful because we love him so much."</p>



<p>Doctors at Mayo Clinic are monitoring Curtis' progress closely. Meanwhile, Curtis' future is back to looking bright, only now with even deeper gratitude in his heart.</p>



<p>"This truly is the gift of life," says Curtis.</p>

<p>For most athletes, the road to the Olympics is paved with years of training and sacrifice. As professional tennis player Gaby Dabrowski was preparing for her 2024 season and a chance to play in the Summer Olympics, her journey took an unexpected detour. A diagnosis of breast cancer threatened her dream and her life.</p>



<p>What followed was a carefully coordinated plan at Mayo Clinic, designed not only to treat the cancer but also to preserve her ability to compete on the world stage.</p>

<p>"I started playing tennis when I was 7 years old," Gaby says. "Growing up, the Olympics were always on TV for two weeks in the summer, so it was always my dream to compete at the Olympics."</p>



<p>Heading into the 2024 season, Gaby was ready to realize her childhood dream. But when she found a lump on her breast, Gaby's focus went immediately to her health.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maynard-jennifer-r-m-d/bio-20055247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jennifer Maynard</a>, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician specializing in sports medicine, helped coordinate Gaby's care.</p>



<p>"We recommended a pretty urgent evaluation, as she was over 30, we wanted to get the mammogram and the ultrasound," says Dr. Maynard.</p>



<p>Those results were abnormal. A <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-mri-for-dense-breasts-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast MRI</a> followed, then a biopsy confirmed the lump was cancer.</p>



<p>"When I was diagnosed, I didn't know if I would be able to play tennis again," Gaby says.</p>



<p>"She knew her ultimate goal was to be an Olympian at the Paris Olympics, so we had to be innovative and think outside the box," says Dr. Maynard.</p>



<p>Gaby's care team had to consider how to treat her cancer in a way that avoided the muscles used in playing tennis.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2024, she underwent surgery, then targeted radiation. Treatment was successful, and Gaby was cancer-free.</p>



<p>"Even though I wasn't playing on court and playing the game that I love, it was like swapping in the care team as my partners," Gaby says.</p>



<p>As soon as her care team cleared her, Gaby resumed training. Her dedication paid off in Paris. Gaby and her doubles partner earned an Olympic bronze medal, living out a dream.</p>

<p>"When I was on the podium holding the medal, I really just felt full elation," Gaby says. "I didn't feel like it was just a win for me. I felt like it was a win for everyone: my best friends, my parents, my coaching team, my care team."</p>



<p>Gaby has continued to find success on the court in tournaments and off, as an advocate for personal health.</p>



<p>"I certainly have a newfound appreciation for playing a sport as my job, but at the same time, if you took it away from me right now, I'd be OK because I have my health, and that's the most important thing," Gaby says.</p>

<p><em>Cancer, stroke, bone loss among diseases and conditions studied in microgravity</em></p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Florida — Mayo Clinic physician and researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-00092417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Abba Zubair’s</a> work combines two passions — medicine and space — for the benefit of astronauts and people on Earth. His research in space is yielding discoveries in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, bone loss and more. In this expert alert, Dr. Zubair answers five questions about his studies in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/what-is-microgravity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microgravity</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are you hoping to accomplish through your research?</h2>



<p>"The goal is to harness the uniqueness of the space environment for the betterment of humanity, be it on Earth or in space," Dr. Zubair says."We wanted to take advantage of the environment at the International Space Station to study how it affects human physiology."</p>



<p>The absence of gravity and the impacts of radiation and vacuum are three fundamental aspects of the uniqueness of space, adds Dr. Zubair, who has sent three research projects to the International Space Station (ISS) since 2017, with more to come.</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative biotherapeutics</a> specialist, Dr. Zubair's work focuses in part on adult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stem cells</a>&nbsp;— known as mesenchymal stem cells —and their use in future treatments for stroke. He noted that he uses stem cells in regenerative medicine and in supporting Mayo's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant program</a>.</p>



<p>"I also know how challenging it is to grow them in the lab. One of the first fundamentals is to see how the absence of gravity influences how stem cells divide and the growth rate," Dr. Zubair explains. "We wanted to see whether cells grown in space are any better or grow faster than cells grown in the lab. When we did our first space flight, we had a really interesting finding, because we realized that the absence of gravity affects stem cells, but it depends on the type of stem cells." &nbsp;</p>



<p>That led Dr. Zubair to another project on the ISS: studying how mesenchymal stem cells, the precursor for bone-forming cells, play a role in bone formation or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoporosis</a>, bone loss. He notes that astronauts tend to lose bone density despite rigorous exercise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How might your research benefit people with cancer?</h2>



<p>Dr. Zubair is also studying how <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leukemia</a> stem cells, the cells that form the seed of this blood cancer, respond to the space environment.</p>



<p>"We are also working to understand the impact of space radiation, from the angle of how we can mitigate the effect of radiation and prevent cancer," Dr. Zubair says. "In the long run, we really want to protect astronauts, especially during long-term space travel, such as to Mars, where they would be deep in space and away from any magnetic field protection that we get from Earth."</p>



<p>The research also may benefit people on Earth by revealing how to protect stem cells or cells in general when there is radiation exposure, such as nuclear accidents, he adds.</p>



<p>In addition, Dr. Zubair's space research could have implications for CAR-T treatment, bone marrow transplants or other therapies for cancer patients.</p>



<p>"If we can understand how stem cells in space, especially <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hematopoietic&nbsp;stem cells</a> (cells that live in the bone marrow and produce cells that function in the blood), expand and differentiate to make immune cells like T cells, microphages, we will learn how to make them more efficiently," Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You've remarked that you can envision a time when people might go into space to receive certain medical treatments. How would that work, and might it be possible to simulate microgravity for those treatments on Earth?</h2>



<p>If cells proliferate more in space, for example if cancer cells go into what is called cell cycle and multiply abnormally when they proliferate, then chemotherapy will be more effective, Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<p>"If that is the case, that absence of gravity can induce leukemia cells or other cancer cells to go into cell cycle, that makes them susceptible to chemotherapy," he explains. "So instead of giving the chemo on Earth, you might go into space where the absence of gravity makes the cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy. That would be one more reason to go to space. That is definitely something that I would love to explore."</p>



<p>It would be difficult to create a comparable microgravity environment on Earth, but technically, it could be done, Dr. Zubair adds.</p>

<p>"Microgravity on Earth is basically like going into a swimming pool, a state of buoyancy where you are kind of in suspension; the gravity is canceled out by the effect of the water," he says. "Now, obviously it wouldn't be pleasant to be in water for quite some time. In the lab, we use a microgravity simulator where cells are suspended. It would be interesting if you could do the same for a human being."</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What attracted you to space research?</h2>



<p>Dr. Zubair grew up in Kano, Nigeria, and remembers gazing at the night sky as a child.</p>



<p>"As far back as I can remember, I was always fascinated by what is out there in space. Looking at the moon and all the stars, and really that ignites my passion for space and space exploration," Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's first dream was to become an astronaut, but an adviser in high school counseled him to find a more practical career, and he pursued medicine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's next?</h2>



<p>One of Dr. Zubair's next two payloads to the International Space Station, not yet scheduled for launch, will examine whether umbilical cord blood cells, rich in stem cells and potential therapeutic value, can be expanded. Another study will explore different cell types that participate in bone formation and whether the problem of bone loss in space can be alleviated through use of a special compound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If it works, then definitely we will see how we can treat patients with osteoporosis, particularly women, cancer patients, or people who are bedridden for a long time and are not weight-bearing, which affects their bone," Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair notes that all of his space experiments are done in parallel on Earth with identical cells to compare the two results and validate the findings from space.</p>



<p>&nbsp;"I really think there is a lot out there that is just waiting for us to explore and use," he says. "And that's why I do what I do."</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair has been honored by NASA with the Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for demonstrating that human-derived mesenchymal stem cells grown aboard the International Space Station could be used for potential clinical applications.</p>

<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rosenthal-allison-c-d-o/bio-20178616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Allison Rosenthal's</a> experience facing a leukemia diagnosis while in medical school inspired her to pursue a career fighting cancer. It also gave her insight into aspects of life with cancer for people under 40. Now, Dr. Rosenthal is among the leaders of an effort at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> to help younger adults and older teens receive age-appropriate care and support. In this expert alert, Dr. Rosenthal shares three topics that younger people with cancer often want to discuss with their healthcare teams.</p>



<p>"I have a very big passion and motivation to take care of our younger cancer patients," Dr. Rosenthal explains. "These are some of the people who need the most support after treatment."</p>



<p>Advances in cancer treatments have made many of the cancers most common in younger people highly treatable and often curable, Dr. Rosenthal says.</p>



<p>Worldwide, roughly 1.3 million people ages 15 to 39 were diagnosed with cancer in 2022, the most recent statistics available, according to the <a href="https://gco.iarc.fr/today/en/dataviz/bars?mode=cancer&amp;age_start=3&amp;age_end=7&amp;populations=900&amp;multiple_populations=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Agency for Research on Cancer</a>. The most common cancers in that age group were <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thyroid</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/testicular-cancer-care/symptoms-causes/syc-20352986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">testicular</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian</a>, blood cancers (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leukemias</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lymphoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymphomas</a>) and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-colorectal-cancer-in-young-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal</a>, agency figures show.</p>



<p>While long-term disease control or a cure is the objective, completing treatment doesn't necessarily mean that a younger person's experience with cancer is over, she adds.</p>



<p>"That means many adolescent or young adult cancer patients go on to live long lives, leaving them to navigate <a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/category/survivorship/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer survivorship</a> for decades," says Dr. Rosenthal, a hematologist and oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Phoenix. "There is the emotional impact that comes along with having experienced cancer, and that can be significant as they try to move forward in life. And there are also the physical effects and the long-lasting impact of that."</p>



<p>In addition to being a time of transition from pediatric medical care to adult care, the late teens and young adulthood typically are times of major life changes, adding challenges on top of cancer. The adolescent and young adult cancer program "is predicated on the idea that centering care around their unique needs improves their experience and outcomes," Dr. Rosenthal explains. In addition to individual feedback from patients, the program has a patient advisory council whose participants share what is important to them.</p>



<p>"We've tried to prioritize what we're working on based on the feedback we're getting from our patients who are in the midst of this experience," she says.</p>



<p>Dr. Rosenthal has observed that questions on these three topics are often on the minds of patients in their late teens, 20s and 30s during and after cancer treatment:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>"There are guidelines and recommendations for lifestyle choices including exercise, but it's a little bit hard to access those and to hold themselves accountable to pursue them," Dr. Rosenthal says.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/group/adolescent-young-adult-aya-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Connection with peers</a> with cancer and additional support to know that they're not alone.</li>
</ul>



<p>"And when their peers move on, to feel that they aren't left behind," Dr. Rosenthal explains.</p>

</ul>



<p>"It's difficult for people to navigate," Dr. Rosenthal says. "It can be uncomfortable to ask about. It's hard to tell their peers about. There's a lot of work going into what we can proactively do to best support them."</p>



<p>Fertility can be impacted by cancer and its treatment, making conversations about <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/in-depth/fertility-preservation/art-20047512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertility preservation</a> important.</p>



<p>Another priority for the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adolescent and Young Adult Cancer Program</a> is <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/for-patients-and-visitors/advance-care-planning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advance care planning</a>. For older people with advanced cancers, involving palliative care earlier often helps them live longer and have a better quality of life, Dr. Rosenthal notes. That same approach could help younger patients.</p>



<p>"We're working on an advance care planning project specifically for young people with advanced cancers, to empower them to have a voice when they have time to have a voice, and not have that taken from them as well," Dr. Rosenthal says. "I know there's so much that can be done. Long-term outcomes, survivorship, quality of life — all of that is very important."</p>



<p>The program takes a multidisciplinary approach, including cancer specialists, social workers, health psychologists, and financial and vocational counselors.</p>



<p>"We're really fortunate that the majority of young adult patients who get cancer care are going to do well in the long term; there's going to be a lot of long-term survivors," Dr. Rosenthal says. "But if we aren't paying attention to the long-term treatment side effects, quality of life and the monitoring and maintenance of health, then we aren't providing the full service for these patients that they really deserve."</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — In a bold step to transform cancer care,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;is bringing new hope for patients diagnosed with the most aggressive and treatment-resistant cancers. Today, Mayo Clinic opened the new 228,000-square-foot Duan Family Building at its Jacksonville, Florida location. The building will house the first carbon ion therapy program in the Americas, and advanced technology that can seamlessly deliver both carbon ions and protons to treat the same tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Carbon ion therapy and other heavy particle therapies are the advanced radiation therapies of our future," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/willman-cheryl-l-m-d/bio-20537787" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheryl Willman, M.D.</a>, executive director,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. "When battling our patients' complex, currently radioresistant cancers at Mayo Clinic, we need the advantage of these next-gen radiation tools, which can be fine-tuned to target and treat aggressive tumors while minimizing the impact to surrounding tissue."</p>



<p>As a leading National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center with locations in Florida, Minnesota and Arizona, Mayo Clinic is uniquely qualified to bring carbon ion therapy, as well as the dual carbon ion and proton treatment option, to the Americas.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is building a better future where more cures are possible&nbsp;—&nbsp;giving new hope to patients with aggressive cancers," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/documents/2019/09/12/20/18/gianrico-farrugia.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=D1B315B05A8056FE1FA32F1738D86AA50D18CFD7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gianrico Farrugia, M.D.</a>, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic. "This is the latest demonstration of our commitment&nbsp;to patient-centered healthcare transformation through our Bold. Forward. strategy."</p>



<p>While treatment with carbon ion therapy is expected to begin in 2028 and proton therapy in 2027, the opening of the Duan Family Building marks a significant milestone. Beginning this summer, other cancer treatment options will be offered in the new building, including photon therapy, immunotherapy, chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy (CAR-T cell therapy) and more, along with sophisticated imaging technology.</p>



<p>"The emerging treatments that will be offered in the Duan Family Building, including carbon ion therapy, are an important part of the integrated cancer practice at Mayo Clinic, ensuring constant, research-driven innovation in the care we are providing to patients," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/documents/2019/09/12/20/18/kent-thielen.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=CB300258C2FA133B3C470D27393B2A81E2099699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kent Thielen, M.D.</a>,&nbsp;CEO of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, working with outside global experts, are also exploring the use of other heavy ions beyond carbon in clinical studies to evaluate their potential benefits in future cancer care.</p>



<p>This building and the advances in cancer care treatment technology housed within represent a significant investment, largely thanks to the generosity and vision of our benefactors.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Advancing radiation therapy</h2>



<p>Many patients with cancer require radiation therapy during their treatment.&nbsp;Different forms of radiation therapy have varying biological impacts on cancer cells.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Photon therapy:&nbsp;</strong>This is the most common form of radiation therapy, which uses X-rays or gamma rays — packets of light energy called photons — to treat cancer. Beams are directed at the tumor, preventing the cancer cells from growing or dividing.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Proton beam therapy:</strong> This particle therapy directs a precise dose of positively charged particles (protons) at cancer cells, destroying their genetic material while minimizing the impact on surrounding, healthy cells. This is especially beneficial for treating tumors near vital organs and cancer in children.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Carbon ion therapy:</strong> This heavy particle therapy delivers positively charged particles (carbon ions) that release their energy upon hitting the targeted cancerous tumor. The particles destroy cancer cells with very little damage to surrounding tissue. It is particularly effective against cancer cells that are resistant to other forms of radiation.</li>
</ul>



<p>Advances in radiation therapies, such as carbon ion and dual modality treatments of proton beam and carbon ion, enable clinicians to create highly individualized, precise and effective treatments, ultimately bringing more cures to patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How radiation therapies work</h2>

<p><em>Late-breaking abstract featured at ASCO 2025</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colon cancer</a> is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S., and while screening has helped detect and prevent colon cancer from spreading, major advancements in treating colon cancer have lagged.</p>



<p>Now, new research led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> found that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery for patients with stage 3 (node-positive) colon cancer — and with a specific genetic makeup called deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) — was associated with a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence and death compared to chemotherapy alone. Approximately 15% of people diagnosed with colon cancer exhibit dMMR and, to date, these tumors appear less sensitive to chemotherapy. The results of the multi-center <a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244715">study</a> were presented during a plenary session at the <a href="https://www.asco.org/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting</a> in Chicago.</p>



<p>"The findings from our study represent a major advance in the adjuvant treatment of dMMR stage 3 colon cancer and will now change the treatment for this type of cancer," says oncologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, who led the study. "It's extremely rewarding to be able to offer our patients a new treatment regimen that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve their chances of survival."</p>



<p>Until now, the standard treatment after surgery for any stage 3 colon cancer has been chemotherapy. However, the researchers note that approximately 30% of patients experience cancer recurrence despite this treatment.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

<p>The clinical trial enrolled 712 patients with dMMR stage 3 colon cancer that had been surgically removed and who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes<a>.</a> The immunotherapy given in this study was an immune checkpoint inhibitor, known as atezolizumab, which activates one's immune system to attack and kill cancer cells, which are responsible for cancer recurrence and spread. The patients — who lived in the U.S. and Germany — received chemotherapy for six months along with immunotherapy and then continued with immunotherapy alone for another six months.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope and others previously studied patients with colon cancer whose cells are unable to repair errors during DNA replication that create a nucleotide mismatch, a condition called dMMR. They noted that these patients' tumors showed a striking increase in inflammatory cells within the tumor, including those that express the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This sparked the idea of using immune checkpoint inhibitors to make the immune cells more effective in attacking and killing the cancer cells.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the data from this study, Dr. Sinicrope recommends this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment to be the new standard treatment for stage 3 deficient mismatch repair colon cancer. The research team plans to approach the <a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>, a nonprofit organization consisting of 33 leading cancer centers, including Mayo Clinic, with this recommendation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study included patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, as these patients can have tumors that show deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).</p>



<p>"We're changing the paradigm in colon cancer treatment. By using immunotherapy at earlier stages of disease, we are achieving meaningful benefits for our patients," says Dr. Sinicrope.</p>

<p><em>International Thyroid Awareness Week is May 25-31<br><br></em>ROCHESTER, Minnesota— Globally, women are roughly twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354161">thyroid cancer</a>. However, recent research shows that men face an equal risk. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> experts say that men and women alike should be aware of thyroid cancer risk.</p>



<p>The thyroid is a small gland located at the front of your neck. It plays a role in regulating the body's metabolism. Thyroid cancer happens when cells in the thyroid develop changes in their DNA.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Worldwide, thyroid cancer is the <a href="/Users/m086474/Downloads/CA%2520A%2520Cancer%2520J%2520Clinicians%2520-%25202024%2520-%2520Bray%2520-%2520Global%2520cancer%2520statistics%25202022%2520%2520GLOBOCAN%2520estimates%2520of%2520incidence%2520and%2520mortality%2520(1).pdf">seventh most common cancer</a>, statistics from the <a href="https://gco.iarc.who.int/media/globocan/factsheets/cancers/39-all-cancers-fact-sheet.pdf">Global Cancer Observatory</a> show.</p>



<p>Most forms of thyroid cancer can be cured, and minimally invasive surgery may be an option, sometimes sparing much of the noncancerous thyroid gland tissue, says Dr. Eric Moore, a head and neck surgeon and chair of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084">otolaryngology</a> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and medical director, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/international">Mayo Clinic International</a>.</p>



<p>“Some thyroid cancer, though rarer, is very aggressive and more difficult to treat,” Dr. Moore adds. “While these were once thought untreatable, we have made great strides in treatment of the most aggressive of these cancers, and our research and treatment have made transformative strides in the outcomes for our patients with these types of thyroid cancer.”</p>



<p>It’s not known in most cases what caused the DNA changes that triggered thyroid cancer: Exposure to high levels of radiation, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162">radiation therapy</a> to the head and neck, may increase the risk, and some types of thyroid cancer may run in families.</p>



<p>In the past, it was believed that women developed thyroid cancer more than men.&nbsp;However, <a href="https://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/november-2021/vol-14-issue-11-p-11-12/">more recent data</a> shows that women are often diagnosed with a less aggressive, relatively non-life-threatening form of thyroid cancer: When it comes to advanced thyroid cancer, the risks are the same for both men and women.</p>



<p>"Men have a risk, and we're not catching them as much," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bernet-victor-m-d/bio-20055366">Dr. Victo</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bernet-victor-m-d/bio-20055366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">r</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bernet-victor-m-d/bio-20055366">&nbsp;Bernet</a>, an endocrinologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/">Mayo Clinic</a> in Jacksonville, Florida.</p>



<p>The reason is unclear. But one theory is that women are more proactive about their health and seeing their doctor regularly, leading to more diagnoses.</p>



<p>"So, in actuality, they probably don't have as much of a higher risk than we thought," explains Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>Thyroid cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. But as it grows, it can cause signs and symptoms, such as swelling in your neck; changes to your voice, such as increased hoarseness; neck and throat pain; and difficulty swallowing.</p>



<p>Most people with thyroid cancer that requires treatment will have surgery to remove part or all of the thyroid. Which operation your health care team might recommend depends on your type of thyroid cancer, the size of the cancer and it has spread beyond the thyroid to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353902">lymph nodes</a>. Your care team also considers your preferences when creating a treatment plan.</p>



<p>Operations used to treat thyroid cancer include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Removing all or most of the thyroid (thyroidectomy).</strong>&nbsp;An operation to remove the thyroid gland might involve removing all of the thyroid tissue (total thyroidectomy) or most of the thyroid tissue (near-total thyroidectomy). The surgeon often leaves small rims of thyroid tissue around the parathyroid glands to reduce the risk of damage to the parathyroid glands, which help regulate the calcium levels in your blood.</li>



<li><strong>Removing a portion of the thyroid (thyroid lobectomy).</strong>&nbsp;During a thyroid lobectomy, the surgeon removes half of the thyroid. Lobectomy might be recommended if you have a slow-growing thyroid cancer in one part of the thyroid, no suspicious nodules in other areas of the thyroid and no signs of cancer in the lymph nodes.</li>



<li><strong>Removing lymph nodes in the neck (lymph node dissection).</strong>&nbsp;Thyroid cancer often spreads to nearby lymph nodes in the neck. An ultrasound examination of the neck before surgery may reveal signs that cancer cells have spread to the lymph nodes. If so, the surgeon may remove some of the lymph nodes in the neck for testing.</li>
</ul>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, people with thyroid cancer are cared for by a team that includes a variety of specialties, such as endocrinologists; endocrine and head and neck surgeons; ear, nose and throat specialists; oncologists; radiologists; and pathologists. Team members have access to the latest technology, techniques and evidence, and weigh <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thyroid-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20354170">treatment options</a> to create a personalized plan for each patient.</p>



<p>Among Mayo physicians dedicated to treating thyroid cancer, Mayo Clinic’s <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/overview/ovc-20457302">Advanced Thyroid Cancer Multidisciplinary Clinic</a> focuses on advanced and aggressive thyroid cancers. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-otorhinolaryngology/divisions/head-neck-cancer-reconstructive-surgery/thyroid-cancer">Mayo researchers</a> are studying the full range of the disease, from early stages to advanced cancers, to constantly refine the understanding and approach to all aspects of thyroid cancer and help physicians achieve the best outcomes for patients.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s Note: May is National Skin Cancer Awareness Month&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melanoma</a> is an aggressive form of skin cancer. In 2025, an estimated 104,960 cases of invasive melanoma will be diagnosed in the U.S., and an estimated 8,430 people will die of melanoma, according to the <a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/annual-cancer-facts-and-figures/2025/2025-cancer-facts-and-figures-acs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. When detected early, however, the five-year survival rate for melanoma is 99%.</p>

<p>When it comes to who may be most at risk of developing melanoma, it is often thought that those with darker complexions do not have to take the same precautions as those with fair complexions. The reality is that no one is immune to melanoma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While people with a darker complexion may have significantly increased protection from the sun, they are still prone to developing melanoma skin cancer. More commonly for those with a darker complexion, melanoma develops on the extremities — hands and feet — with worse tumors at the time of diagnosis and poorer subsequent outcomes if not caught early.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Skin checks</strong></h2>



<p>That is why it is incredibly important to become familiar with your skin and conduct regular skin exams at home. When performing skin checks, you'll want to look out for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A new growth on the skin that might look like a mole, bump or scab.</li>



<li>A rough patch on the skin.</li>



<li>A sore on the skin that won’t heal.</li>



<li>Changes to a mole or freckle — getting bigger or changing color.</li>



<li>Itchy skin around a skin growth.</li>



<li>Pain around a skin growth.</li>
</ul>



<p>Regardless of your <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/melanoma-in-darker-skin-tones-race-and-sex-play-a-role-mayo-study-finds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin color</a>, if you notice any of the above, then you should see a healthcare professional. A skin check by a dermatologist usually only takes a few minutes, but that short time spent in the doctor's office could add years to your life if skin cancer is detected early.</p>



<p>For higher risk individuals, including those with a personal or family history of melanoma, people over age 65, those with a suppressed immune system, people that burn easily, as well as those who have light-colored eyes and hair, a baseline evaluation with a dermatologist is critical and then continued at recommended intervals going forward, as determined by your healthcare team.</p>



<p>Most skin cancers can be prevented by taking a few simple precautions to protect yourself from the sun. It is recommended that you wear sunscreen year-round and reapply during peak sun conditions.&nbsp;</p>

Currently, there is no cure for it.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have established the world's first biobank of human salivary gland tissue-organoids that opens the door to research to find a cure.</p>

<p>"This unique biobank resource overcomes a major barrier we've faced in the field, namely: limited access to standardized salivary specimens suited for salivary gland regeneration research. This collection provides a foundation for regenerative therapy development, especially for radiation-induced chronic dry mouth," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kannan-nagarajan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20233074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</a>, lead author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-025-00410-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in NPJ Regenerative Medicine. Dr. Kannan is also the director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/stem-cell-and-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>Nearly 70% of patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy experience permanent damage to their salivary glands. People with this condition experience diminished quality of life from a constant feeling like cotton is lining their mouths. Besides being uncomfortable, chronic dry mouth can lead to difficulties with chewing, tasting, speaking and swallowing. It also can cause tooth decay.</p>



<p>"Chronic dry mouth can extend long after radiation treatments are complete. It's among the top concerns I hear from patients with head and neck cancer. Unfortunately, there aren't many therapeutics available commercially for these patients," says&nbsp;co-author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/janus-jeffrey-jeff-r-m-d/bio-20206511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey Janus, M.D.</a>, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>One promising avenue of research is the cultivation of rare regenerative cells to greater numbers that can help people someday heal and grow new, healthy salivary gland cells. The biobank consists of specimens collected from 208 donors. From this repository, researchers have already found biomarkers for mature, saliva-producing cells, and with the help of a high-resolution protein map, they have identified the potential tissue origin of rare, self-renewing salivary cells.</p>



<p>The research team also developed a radiation injury model, which paired with the biobank, provides an integrated platform to discover new, personalized regenerative biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>This is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-medicine/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>.</p>
