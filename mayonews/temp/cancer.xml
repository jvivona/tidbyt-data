<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A medication commonly used to treat overactive bladder significantly reduced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hot-flashes/symptoms-causes/syc-20352790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot flashes</a> in men receiving hormone therapy for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a>, according to a study published in the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO-25-01486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a> which included several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers.</p>



<p>The phase 2 study found that oxybutynin, a medication commonly prescribed to treat overactive bladder, worked better than a placebo at reducing how often hot flashes occurred and how intense they were in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Men who took oxybutynin also reported improvements in their day-to-day functioning and overall quality of life.</p>



<p>Hot flashes affect an estimated 60% to 80% of men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy and can interfere with sleep, mood and overall well-being. For some patients, these symptoms are severe enough to make it difficult to continue treatment.</p>

<p>"Hot flashes are often underestimated in men, but they can have a real and lasting impact on quality of life during prostate cancer treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stish-brad-j-m-d/bio-20340352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Stish, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "This trial shows that oxybutynin can provide significant relief with a favorable safety profile."</p>



<p>The study enrolled 88 men with prostate cancer who were experiencing frequent hot flashes while receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oxybutynin at one of two doses or a placebo for six weeks.</p>



<p>Men who received the higher dose of oxybutynin experienced the greatest benefit, with an average reduction of nearly seven hot flashes per day, compared with about two fewer hot flashes per day in the placebo group. More than 75% of men receiving the higher dose achieved at least a 50% reduction in hot flash severity.</p>



<p>Patients taking oxybutynin also reported less disruption to sleep, work, social activities and overall quality of life. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred during the study. The most common side effect was dry mouth, which was more frequent at higher doses.</p>



<p>Oxybutynin has previously been shown to reduce hot flashes in women, but evidence in men had been limited. This trial is among the first randomized, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate its effectiveness for men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy.</p>



<p>"These results expand the options available to clinicians and patients who are trying to manage a challenging side effect of prostate cancer treatment," says Dr. Stish. "Having additional, well-tolerated choices matters."</p>



<p>Researchers note that larger studies will be needed to confirm the findings and determine the optimal dose, but the results support the use of oxybutynin as a treatment option for men with bothersome hot flashes related to hormone therapy.</p>



<p>The study was conducted through the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, part of the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trial Network. It included participants from academic and community cancer centers across the U.S. Mayo Clinic has a financial interest in the technology referenced in this news release. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt8706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers suggests that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a> cells quickly activate a survival response after PARP inhibitor treatment, and blocking this early response may make this class of drugs work better.</p>



<p>PARP inhibitors are a common treatment for ovarian cancer and can be especially effective in cancers with impaired DNA repair. However, many tumors eventually stop responding, even when the drugs initially show results. The new research identifies a way cancer cells may survive PARP inhibitor treatment early on, and it points to a potential strategy to block that response.</p>



<p>In the study, researchers found that ovarian cancer cells rapidly activate a pro-survival program after exposure to PARP inhibitors. A key driver of this response is FRA1, a transcription factor that helps turn on genes that allow cancer cells to adapt and avoid cell death.</p>



<p>"This work shows that drug resistance does not always emerge slowly over time — cancer cells can activate survival programs very early after treatment begins," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kanakkanthara-arun-ph-d/bio-20445738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arun Kanakkanthara, Ph.D.</a>, an oncology investigator at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. "By targeting that early response, we may be able to improve how well existing therapies work and potentially delay or prevent resistance."</p>



<p>The research team tested whether brigatinib, an FDA-approved drug currently used to treat certain lung cancers, could block this survival response and enhance the effects of PARP inhibitors. Brigatinib was selected because of its ability to inhibit multiple signaling pathways involved in cancer cell survival.</p>



<p>The results showed that combining brigatinib with a PARP inhibitor was more effective than either treatment alone. Importantly, this effect was seen only in cancer cells, not in normal cells, suggesting the potential for a more targeted and safer treatment approach.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that brigatinib helps in a completely new way. Rather than acting through traditional DNA repair pathways, brigatinib shuts down two key signaling molecules, FAK and EPHA2, that aggressive ovarian cancer cells rely on to survive. Blocking both signals at once weakened the cancer cells' ability to adapt and resist treatment, leaving them far more vulnerable to PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>The researchers also found a potential clue for identifying which patients might benefit most from this treatment. Tumors with higher levels of the signaling molecules FAK and EPHA2 responded better to the drug combination. Other data suggest that ovarian cancers with high levels of these molecules are often more aggressive, highlighting the promise of this approach for harder-to-treat cases.</p>



<p>"From a clinical perspective, resistance remains one of the biggest challenges in treating ovarian cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/weroha-john-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Weroha, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. "By combining mechanistic insights from Dr. Kanakkanthara's laboratory with my clinical experience, this preclinical work supports the strategy of targeting resistance early, before it has a chance to take hold. This strategy could improve patient outcomes."</p>



<p>This research sheds new light on how ovarian cancer evades treatment, and it points to a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic announced today additional capabilities within <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/orchestrate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform_Orchestrate</a> that make it more efficient for researchers to access standardized, real-world cancer data from Mayo Clinic and participating <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/focus-areas/healthcare-providers/connect/#overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform_Connect</a> partners. This gives researchers the ability to generate insights that can accelerate cancer research and improve patient care.</p>



<p>Developing new cancer therapies is a long and complex process that typically takes many years. Orchestrate's capabilities can help shorten this timeline by giving researchers faster access to high-quality, real-world cancer data.</p>



<p>Orchestrate is now using an industry-leading, standardized framework to organize complex cancer information, known as Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Oncology. The new function can present de-identified data in a consistent, structured and research-ready format. This includes standardized information such as tumor characteristics, biomarkers, staging, treatments, progression and outcomes. These key oncology attributes are refined from a rich background of structured data (e.g., diagnoses, lab test results) and unstructured data (e.g., imaging, pathology and radiology reports) already integrated on Mayo Clinic Platform to enable better clinical insights and research.</p>



<p>The OMOP Oncology model is a product of the global <a href="https://www.ohdsi.org/who-we-are/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI)</a> initiative. The model's standardized structureallows researchers to analyze complex cancer data more rapidly, accurately and on a larger scale than before.</p>



<p>"The integration of OMOP Oncology into Mayo Clinic Platform has the power to accelerate discovery, improve clinical trial design, unlock real-world insights and support the development of next-generation therapies for patients worldwide," said <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heath-elisabeth-i-m-d/bio-20576547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elisabeth Heath, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Oncology at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nemesis.health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nemesis&nbsp;Health</a>,&nbsp;a&nbsp;research&nbsp;and technology service&nbsp;provider&nbsp;for&nbsp;Mayo&nbsp;Clinic Platform, contributed to the development of OMOP Oncology capabilities on Orchestrate.</p>



<p>This year, Mayo Clinic Platform will also incorporate tokenization, a technology that connects de-identified information from across a patient's care experience to provide a more complete, longitudinal view of their healthcare journey. Combined with the OMOP Oncology model, this will give researchers a more comprehensive understanding of a patient's cancer care pathway before, during and after their care at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A Mayo Clinic study is providing new insights into how treatment sequence can affect survival in patients with early-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatic-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20355421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatic cancer</a>, suggesting that many patients may benefit from receiving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> before surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings, published in the <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fjnccn.org%2Fview%2Fjournals%2Fjnccn%2F24%2F2%2Farticle-p27.xml&amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeboom.Emily%40mayo.edu%7Cdae0a8e36f874fed8dfe08de65c3612b%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C639060086987855425%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=1X5dHNT9bLW58K54krBrpu%2BWUZQn3PNMQ1ZnTalwdqo%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JNCCN<em>—</em>Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>, were based on more than 1,400 patients treated across <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's campuses</a> in Minnesota, Arizona and Florida. Researchers found that when pancreatic tumors were in contact with the superior mesenteric vein — a major blood vessel by the pancreas — patients who underwent surgery first experienced reduced survival rates. In contrast, patients who received chemotherapy before surgery had similar survival outcomes to those whose tumors were not touching the vein.</p>



<p>"Many patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer undergo surgery first because it is historically believed to be the best chance for cure," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fong-zhi-ven-m-d-dr-ph/bio-20555871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zhi Ven Fong, M.D., Dr.PH.</a>, surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and co-senior author of the study. "Our findings suggest that chemotherapy first, even in cases thought to be more straightforward, provides patients with the best opportunity for long-term survival."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/detecting-pancreatic-cancer-through-changes-in-body-composition-and-metabolism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pancreatic cancer</a> is notoriously aggressive, and progress over the past decade to increase patient survival has been limited. Chemotherapy before surgery, called neoadjuvant chemotherapy, aims to shrink the tumor and target cancer cells that may have spread. This approach increases the chance of complete tumor removal during an operation and improves survival outcomes.</p>



<p>"Our data confirms what we've seen in practice at Mayo Clinic for years," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/truty-mark-j-m-d-m-s/bio-20055639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Truty, M.D.</a>, surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and co-senior author. "The timing of surgery relative to chemotherapy is critically important for patient outcomes."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rethinking pancreatic tumor classification</strong></h2>



<p>The study also highlights opportunities to refine how pancreatic cancer is classified. Current guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network categorize tumors by how much they touch certain critical blood vessels. Those with less than 180 degrees on the vein are considered upfront resectable, meaning surgery should be performed right away without chemotherapy first. Mayo Clinic's data suggest that these patients may do better if chemotherapy is considered before surgery.</p>



<p>"Our findings suggest that guidelines could be updated to reclassify tumors with any vein involvement as borderline resectable and to only include cancers with no vein involvement as upfront resectable," says Dr. Fong.</p>



<p>The findings reinforce Mayo Clinic's approach, which already prioritizes chemotherapy before surgery for all pancreatic cancer patients, regardless of stage. Researchers believe this evidence will encourage continued discussion within the oncology community and support thoughtful refinements to national treatment recommendations.</p>



<p>"Our hope is that this study empowers both patients and clinicians to think carefully about treatment sequencing," says Dr. Truty. "We want people to know they have options, and that starting with chemotherapy may be the best path forward."</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>My husband has been diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>. I know his treatment will be hard on him, and I want to help in any way with his diet. What do you recommend for us?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Cancer treatments can take a toll on a person's body. Your husband's treatment may cause nausea, changes in appetite, taste and smell, diarrhea, or constipation, making it harder to meet his nutritional needs. Fortunately, there are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer/art-20045046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strategies</a> you can use to cope with these side effects.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting nutrition during cancer treatment</h2>



<p><strong>Weight changes.&nbsp;</strong>Weight changes are common. Weight loss without trying can reduce muscle mass, stamina and quality of life. Weight gain can lead to the development of other diseases, like diabetes or heart disease. Try to maintain your weight during treatment, even if it's outside a normal range.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Appetite changes.&nbsp;</strong>Cancer and cancer treatment may make you lose your appetite or eat more than usual.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>If you lose your appetite:&nbsp;<ul><li>Eat smaller snacks that are high in calories, including yogurt, nuts, peanut butter and avocado.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Eat more when your appetite is better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><ul><li>Food may sound unappealing even when you're hungry, making it difficult to eat. Try to find something that's appetizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Keep snacks on hand.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>If you eat more when stressed:<ul><li>Choose snacks such as fruits, vegetables and popcorn.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Find ways to manage stress without food, such as going for a walk or calling a friend.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Nausea.&nbsp;</strong>Feeling sick or throwing up due to your treatments makes it hard to eat. Small changes to what and how you eat may help you feel better.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat foods that are easy on your stomach, such as crackers, toast, broth or broth-based soups, ice pops, hard candies, plain pasta and rice.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Eat five or six small meals a day. Smaller meals are often easier to keep down.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Don't skip meals or snacks. Even when you're not hungry, try to eat; an empty stomach can make nausea worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Sip small amounts of fluid during meals and throughout the day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Try pretzels or crackers with your medicines if your care team says it's OK.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Taste and smell changes.&nbsp;</strong>Cancer treatment can alter the taste or smell of food. Some people say food tastes bland. Others say it tastes metallic or too sweet or salty. You may need to try different foods to find what works for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help with taste changes:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Brighten the flavor. Add a little lemon, lime or vinegar unless your mouth is sore.</li>



<li>Try strong flavors. Use spices such as cinnamon, ginger, basil or rosemary.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Make foods sweeter. Add sugar or another sweetener if food tastes bitter or sour.</li>



<li>Use marinades before cooking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Choose other proteins. If meat doesn't taste good, try beans, nuts or fish.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Use plastic or bamboo utensils. These may help if food tastes metallic.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Try new foods. You won't have expectations about the taste.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>To help with strong smells:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Cook food in the microwave or use a crockpot or instant cooker in the garage.</li>



<li>Eat foods cold or at room temperature.</li>



<li>Cover food while it cooks.</li>



<li>Use a window or fan to help remove unpleasant odors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>



<li>Drink from a covered cup.</li>



<li>Ask a friend to cook for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Sore throat, mouth or trouble swallowing.&nbsp;</strong>When your throat is sore or it's hard to swallow, eating may be painful or tiring. These tips can help:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Soften the texture. Opt for smooth foods, such as cooked cereal, mashed potatoes or scrambled eggs.</li>



<li>Cool things down. Choose smoothies, ice pops or a bowl of ice cream.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Take smaller bites and cut food into tiny pieces.</li>



<li>Avoid what bothers you. Spicy, sour, crunchy or vinegar-based foods, citrus fruits, tomato sauce or carbonated beverages can cause discomfort.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Suck on ice chips or ice pops.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Diarrhea and constipation.&nbsp;</strong>Bowel changes are unpleasant but common side effects of cancer treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help with diarrhea:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat small, frequent meals and snacks.</li>



<li>Choose soft, low-fiber foods.</li>



<li>Avoid caffeine and alcohol.</li>



<li>Limit lactose found in milk and yogurt.</li>



<li>Avoid sugar substitutes such as sorbitol, xylitol or mannitol, which are often found in sugar-free candy or gum.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Drink plenty of fluids, including electrolyte-containing fluids, to stay hydrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>For constipation, aim to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Drink enough fluid to stay hydrated and keep stools soft. Try to drink eight to 10 cups of water each day. Warm coffee, tea or broth-based soup in the morning can help your bowels move. Use the bathroom when you feel the urge.</li>



<li>Move your body. Even short walks help your digestive system work better.</li>



<li>Keep regular mealtimes.</li>



<li>Eat a high-fiber diet.<br><br></li>
</ul>



<p>Your husband's care team is an excellent resource for what you can expect during treatment and for the symptoms that may affect his diet and weight.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> is expanding surgical options for patients undergoing treatment or risk reducing procedures for breast cancer through the adoption of robotic nipple-sparing mastectomy at its Minnesota and Florida campuses. Following recent Food and Drug Administration approval of the use of this platform and device for these procedures, Mayo Clinic surgeons are now offering a minimally invasive approach designed to improve cosmetic outcomes, preserve skin and nipple viability, and broaden opportunities for potential sensory restoration.</p>



<p>Nipple-sparing mastectomy preserves the nipple–areolar complex and healthy breast skin, creating a more natural appearing reconstructed breast after reconstruction. The improved cosmetic result can offer meaningful psychological benefits for patients compared with traditional mastectomy. Many patients, however, continue to experience visible scarring, diminished or absent sensation in the breast and nipple, and risk of loss of nipple or skin due to low blood flow.</p>



<p>The robotic approach provides a way to address some of these challenges by enabling a small, lateral incision, gentle tissue retraction with gas insufflation, and enhanced visualization of the surgical field. Mayo Clinic surgeons also are integrating sensory restoring procedures in some cases, including neurotization (reinnervation) of the nipple–areolar complex, to help patients regain protective sensation of their reconstructed breasts.</p>



<p>"When we remove the breast tissue and keep the envelope of the breast skin and nipple, it provides the most natural-appearing breast from a cosmetic standpoint," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/piltin-mara-a-d-o/bio-20487425" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mara Piltin, D.O.</a>, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. "The next step is to improve the process so that patients regain feeling in their breasts and are not constantly seeing scars that remind them of their cancer journey. It will positively impact their sexual health, self-image and recovery."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic continues to lead in NSM innovation, consistently refining surgical techniques and expanding clinical trials to enhance patient outcomes. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-jeffrey-e-m-d/bio-20519730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey E. Johnson, M.D.</a>, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, explains, "At Mayo Clinic, our goal is to ensure that more patients can benefit from innovations that support not only their physical recovery but also their emotional well-being so every patient can move forward with confidence and hope."</p>

<p></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Our neighbors were selling their home and had it tested for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/radon-the-odorless-invisible-threat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radon</a>. The test was positive. Why should we be concerned about radon, and should we have our home tested too?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>The positive test for radon in your neighbors' home has given you a heads-up that your home should be tested as well.</p>



<p>Radon is an odorless, invisible radioactive gas. It's naturally released from rocks, soil and water — and it can get trapped inside your home, office or school. There's no known safe level of radon. Unfortunately, there are no symptoms associated with radon exposure, unlike with carbon monoxide poisoning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why radon is so dangerous</strong></h2>



<p>Breathing high levels of radon over time can lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>&nbsp;since this gas is a Class A carcinogen. It's the No. 1 cause of lung cancer in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/connected-care/can-you-get-lung-cancer-if-youve-never-smoked/cpt-20413370" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonsmokers</a> and the second-leading cause of lung&nbsp;cancer overall. Nationwide, 21,000 people die from radon-caused lung cancer each year.</p>



<p>Smoking and secondhand smoke, combined with exposure to high radon levels, increase your risk of lung cancer. If you or your family are experiencing breathing issues, consult with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-cancer-screening/about/pac-20385024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonologist</a>.</p>



<p>Radon can be found in any home — old or new — and typically enters through cracks in the foundation caused by natural settling and windows. Radon levels often are higher in lower levels and basements. Across the U.S., 1 in 15 homes have elevated radon levels, and levels are higher in the Midwest. For example, radon levels range from 4.7 picocuries per liter of air (pCi/L) in Indiana to 9.6 pCi/L in North Dakota. The nationwide average is 1.3 pCi/L.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Testing for radon</strong></h2>



<p>There's a simple solution to this close-to-home health hazard: testing. That's what the Environmental Protection Agency urges all homeowners to do, especially those in high-radon areas. Testing is the only way to determine the radon level in your home.</p>

</div>


<p>You can find radon testing kits at hardware or other home maintenance stores and online. They cost around $20 or less and are easy to use. It typically takes two to seven days for results. Although there's no safe level of radon, look for test results of 4.0 pCi/L or less.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your home tests higher than 4.0 pCi/L, then you'll need to have a professional&nbsp;fix the radon issue, which includes installing venting equipment. The equipment looks like a big tube that reaches below the foundation&nbsp;of your home and vents radon up and out of the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cost of a radon mitigation system varies according to the size and design of your home, as well as the system being installed. Costs average $1,000-$2,000. Check with your local city and county housing agencies to see if they have funds available for low-interest loans or grants for radon mitigation, and learn if you're eligible for these funds.</p>



<p>Once the mitigation system has been installed, your home should be tested again to make sure the fix is effective. Even if your home passes the first test, you should retest every two years.</p>



<p>Also, radon testing isn't required when selling a home. However, if you're a buyer, you should insist on it. If levels are high, you may be able to negotiate the costs of the mitigation with the seller.</p>



<p>Radon testing and mitigation are investments in your home — and in your health.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;<br>A close friend of mine recently had an abnormal result on a routine&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/pap-smear/about/pac-20394841" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pap test</a>&nbsp;that led to a cancer diagnosis.&nbsp;I know cancer screenings are important, but&nbsp;it's&nbsp;hard to keep track of which ones I should prioritize.&nbsp;Could you help me&nbsp;better understand <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cervical cancer screening</a> and&nbsp;other screenings I should&nbsp;consider&nbsp;now?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;<br>Cancer screenings play a critical role in protecting long-term health. They can detect cancer early, when treatment is most effective, and in some cases help prevent cancer before it develops. While screening recommendations&nbsp;vary based&nbsp;on age, sex, family history and personal risk&nbsp;factors, several key&nbsp;cancer&nbsp;screening&nbsp;tests should be reviewed regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cervical cancer screening is an important part of preventive care and has helped significantly reduce deaths from this disease. Understanding how screening works can help people stay up to date.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cervical cancer:&nbsp;Why screening is essential</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cervical-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cervical cancer</a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;most often caused by long-term infection with certain high-risk types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">human papillomavirus (HPV)</a>.&nbsp;HPV is common, and&nbsp;while most&nbsp;of these&nbsp;infections are cleared by a person's immune system,&nbsp;other&nbsp;HPV&nbsp;infections&nbsp;can persist for years without causing symptoms.&nbsp;People&nbsp;also&nbsp;can become&nbsp;infected with HPV more than once in their lifetime.&nbsp;That's&nbsp;why routine screening is the best way to detect abnormal changes early.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Pap test&nbsp;and HPV&nbsp;test</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>During a Pap test, a healthcare professional gently collects cells from the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina. These cells are examined for abnormal changes that could develop into cancer if left untreated. The test is usually quick and can be done during a routine gynecologic visit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An HPV test is often done at the same time as a Pap test using the same cell sample,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;checks for high-risk types of HPV that are most likely to lead to cervical cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cervical cancer screening does more than look for cancer. Pap tests and HPV tests can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;precancerous changes in the cervix. When these changes are found and treated early, cervical cancer&nbsp;often&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;prevented.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cervical cancer screening recommendations</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ages 21 to 29:</strong>&nbsp;A Pap test every three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Ages 30 to 65:</strong>&nbsp;Several screening options may be&nbsp;appropriate:&nbsp;
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>HPV test alone every five years.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Pap&nbsp;test&nbsp;every three years.&nbsp;</li>



<li>combined Pap and HPV&nbsp;(called co-testing)&nbsp;testing every five years.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Over age 65:</strong>&nbsp;Some people may be able to stop screening if they&nbsp;have&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;normal&nbsp;Pap or co-test&nbsp;results and no history of&nbsp;severe&nbsp;cervical&nbsp;precancer. The&nbsp;decision&nbsp;to stop cervical cancer screening&nbsp;should always be made&nbsp;together with a&nbsp;healthcare professional.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>If a Pap or HPV test shows abnormal results,&nbsp;additional&nbsp;evaluation may be recommended. This can include repeat testing,&nbsp;a&nbsp;colposcopy&nbsp;—&nbsp;a cervical exam&nbsp;done by a clinician using&nbsp;a special magnifying scope&nbsp;—&nbsp;or&nbsp;a cervical&nbsp;biopsy. While abnormal results can be concerning, they often detect changes long before cancer develops, allowing for effective treatment and careful follow-up.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Other cancer screenings to review</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Depending on age and personal risk factors, other cancer screenings&nbsp;also&nbsp;may&nbsp;be recommended.&nbsp;A healthcare professional can help&nbsp;determine&nbsp;which screenings&nbsp;you&nbsp;should&nbsp;schedule.&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Breast cancer screening</strong></a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;mammography&nbsp;is&nbsp;advised&nbsp;for many people beginning at midlife.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Low-dose&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lung-cancer-screening/about/pac-20385024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>CT screening for lung cancer</strong></a>&nbsp;for those with a significant history of smoking&nbsp;may be&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;every&nbsp;year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-screening/art-20046825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Colorectal cancer screening</strong></a>&nbsp;is&nbsp;recommended for most adults beginning at midlife and sometimes earlier for those with a family history or other risk factors. Screening options include colonoscopy and stool-based tests. These screenings can detect colorectal cancer at an early stage or remove precancerous polyps before they develop into cancer.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<li><strong>Anal cancer</strong>&nbsp;is less common, but&nbsp;it's&nbsp;also associated with HPV infection. Routine screening&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;recommended for the general population. However, people with certain risk factors, such as a weakened immune system or a history of HPV-related&nbsp;precancers or cancers, may&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from closer monitoring. Symptoms,&nbsp;including rectal bleeding, pain,&nbsp;itching&nbsp;or a lump,&nbsp;should always be evaluated by a healthcare professional.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Make&nbsp;screening part of your routine</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>An annual visit with a primary care clinician or gynecologist is a good opportunity to review your screening history, discuss vaccines and address new symptoms or concerns. Keeping track of when your last Pap&nbsp;test, HPV&nbsp;test,&nbsp;mammogram&nbsp;or colorectal screening&nbsp;occurred&nbsp;can help ensure&nbsp;that&nbsp;care&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;delayed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cervical Cancer Awareness Month&nbsp;is&nbsp;an important reminder that prevention works. Through regular screening and&nbsp;timely&nbsp;follow-up, cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers. Taking a proactive approach to screenings this year can&nbsp;help&nbsp;protect health now and in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — In a new <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-025-05308-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot feasibility study</a>, researchers from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, the University of Washington School of Medicine, the University of California San Francisco, and Nextrast Inc. found that a new imaging oral agent, also known as a "contrast agent," helps radiologists better see bowel structures and disease in CT imaging when compared with the current oral contrast agents.</p>

<p>The introduction of a new oral contrast agent for CT imaging addresses common challenges in the diagnosis of bowel diseases, says by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fletcher-joel-g-m-d/bio-20053419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Fletcher, M.D.</a>, lead author on the study and medical director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/ct-clinical-innovation-center/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic CT Clinical Innovation Center</a>. "The new oral contrast agent," he explains, "is ingested by patients prior to CT imaging and helps detect pathologies within and outside of the bowel wall in ways current imaging agents do not."</p>



<p>"We carefully designed this new class of oral contrast agent to overcome many of the diagnostic shortcomings of existing contrast agents for a broad range of diseases," says <a href="https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/benjamin-yeh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Yeh, M.D.</a>, a co-author on the study, radiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and co-founder of Nextrast, which created the new agent. "The Clinical Phase 2 results confirm that our dark agent can reveal previously impossible-to-detect findings, including very small bowel tumors and subtle inflammatory conditions that are often missed with conventional agents at CT."</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-025-05308-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, the authors report findings that suggest this new agent significantly improves visualization of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or cancer within the abdomen, and may provide earlier and more confident diagnoses.</p>



<p>The study compared CT scans of 32 patients with the dark borosilicate oral contrast agent and scans with conventional water or iodine-based oral contrast agents, to look at anatomical structures and disease presence.</p>



<p>"The novel dark borosilicate contrast agent has the potential to improve the assessment of numerous pathologies, including the detection of cancer and inflammatory disorders," says <a href="https://rad.uw.edu/people/amileto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achille Mileto, M.D.</a>, a radiologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and first author of the study.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-1024x576.jpg" alt="CT images from a patient who ingested the new oral solution that better distends the stomach (see the white S) and small bowel (asterisks) so that enhancing pathologies inside and outside the bowel wall can be better displayed and detected by radiologists." class="wp-image-409656" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/CT-Image.jpg 1360w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">CT images from a patient who ingested the new oral solution that better distends the stomach (see the white S) and small bowel (asterisks) so that enhancing pathologies inside and outside the bowel wall can be better displayed and detected by radiologists.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Evaluators identified clinically relevant findings in seven patients that were not detected using the standard contrast.</p>



<p>"CT scans performed with the new agent will likely do a better job of displaying pathologies in the stomach and proximal small bowel, areas where CT with traditional oral contrast performs poorly," Dr. Fletcher says. "Pathologies within the lumen will be better displayed because the lumen is more distended, and the brightness of the pathologies on the CT images will be increased, making them more conspicuous.”</p>



<p>The researchers say further study using a larger patient population is needed, but the initial findings show promise.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Our daughter was recently diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370594">cancer</a>. She's interested in participating in a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/about-cancer-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a> but doesn't really know what that means or how to get involved. Can you help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>A cancer diagnosis can feel overwhelming and often comes with a long list of decisions to make.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people are surprised to learn that clinical trials aren't just for people who have run out of standard treatment options, but are an important part of cancer care at every stage and most aspects of diagnosis and treatment. They help physicians study new and better ways to diagnose, treat and improve the quality of life for people. They also give patients access to promising treatments that they might not otherwise receive.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What happens in a cancer clinical trial?</strong></h2>



<p>During a clinical trial, participants may receive specific interventions or potentially the standard treatment. Researchers measure how safe and effective the interventions are and usually compare them to standard treatments. These may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>New cancer drugs or drug combinations.</li>



<li>New medical procedures or devices.</li>



<li>New surgical techniques.</li>



<li>New ways to use existing treatments.</li>



<li>Lifestyle or behavioral approaches.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the biggest misconceptions is that joining a trial means you might not receive treatment or be given a placebo. Most clinical trials compare a new treatment with the current standard of care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who's eligible for a trial?</strong></h2>



<p>Your daughter’s care team is the best starting point. Feel free to ask if she is a candidate for any trial. Physicians at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> routinely review whether patients qualify for available trials. If there's a study that's potentially right for your daughter, your team can connect her with research coordinators and help navigate eligibility, consent, scheduling and next steps.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do people find and sign up for trials?</strong></h2>



<p>Patients can find out about trials in several ways:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Direct referral from their care team (medical oncologist, surgical oncologist, radiation oncologist, radiologist to name a few).</li>



<li>Search tools, such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic clinical trials website</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>.</li>



<li>Trial navigators or research coordinators who help determine eligibility and guide enrollment.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>When a clinician identifies that a patient may be a good candidate for a study, they review the study purpose, what participation involves, potential risks and benefits, and available alternatives. Patients can take time to decide whether to participate and may bring family members or caregivers into these conversations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinic Trials Beyond Walls: Expanding who can participate</strong></h2>



<p>Participating in a clinical trial typically has meant frequent trips to a major medical center, which is something that can be difficult for people balancing work, caregiving responsibilities, transportation needs or facing financial strain.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-to-expand-access-to-state-of-the-art-cancer-care-through-transformational-gift/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Cancer Trials Beyond Walls</a> is an initiative that brings elements of cancer clinical trials closer to home, such as lab draws, remote patient monitoring and virtual visits. This brings the benefits of research directly to patients' doorsteps and makes trial participation more manageable for families.</p>

</div>


<p>Mayo Clinic's decentralized research initiative uses telehealth, remote monitoring, mobile phlebotomy and home-based services so patients can complete parts of a clinical trial without traveling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The care of these patients being managed at home, with the support of a dedicated clinical team, may include vital sign monitoring, symptom reporting, medication administration or follow-up assessments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why do clinical trials matter so much?</strong></h2>



<p>Every cancer therapy available today exists because patients such as your daughter volunteered to participate. Volunteering for trials is a crucial way to advance medical treatment.<br><br>Joining a trial may give your daughter access to cutting-edge care and contribute to future breakthroughs.</p>
