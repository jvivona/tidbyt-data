<p>Judge Audrey Moran is known for her strength and fairness in the courtroom in Florida's Duval county. But one of the most difficult cases she's faced is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> that spread to the lining of her brain.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of a dedicated <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/breast-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20459469">care team</a> and precise treatment, Judge Moran is back on the bench, and recent scans show something remarkable.  Alex Osiadacz (oh-SIGH-dus) has her story.</p>

<p>"I work as a county court judge."</p>



<p>Judge Moran doesn't shy away from a challenge, whether in her legal career, solving issues in her community or even her health.<br><br>"We were treating the metastatic breast cancer in my abdomen about two years ago now. I began noticing that my balance wasn't very good, and then I started limping," she says.</p>



<p>Scans in early 2024 showed the cancer had spread to the lining of her brain and spine. Treatment would pose another challenge after Judge Moran developed an infection where a port would deliver <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> into the lining of her brain.</p>



<p>"I said, 'We're going to have to figure something else out.' My wonderful oncologist, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/advani-pooja-p-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20464247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Pooja Advani</a>, said she thought she had an idea because a new chemo had come out that she thought might be just the right thing for me," she says.</p>

<p>Instead of delivering treatment directly into the lining of her brain, Judge Moran's care team was able to deliver a newly approved therapy through her arm.&amp;nbsp;The results were better than expected.</p>



<p>"The last scan I got of my brain, the results were that the brain cancer has resolved. And I got to tell you, I couldn't even believe it when I read it on my report," Judge Moran says.</p>



<p>"So many emotions but the biggest of gratitude, you know, to all the people that have worked as a part of her team," says Dr. Advani.</p>



<p>Follow-up appointments have confirmed that the treatment is still working for the metastasis in her abdomen.&amp;nbsp;Beyond her diagnosis, Judge Moran remains active with her family and career.</p>



<p>She says, "You know, my life is back. I am at work. And I'm getting to do that work that I love."</p>

<p>In late September, Dr. Advani and Judge Moran had a chance to meet again.</p>



<p>"It almost brought me to tears to have seen how she was in 2024 when she was going through this <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20352479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journey </a>and the remarkable clinical progress that she has made," Dr. Advani says.</p>



<p>Judge Moran adds, "I'd gotten to the point where I almost didn't want to try anything anymore, and she really helped me realize this wasn't the time to give up. It was time to keep going. And boy, I'm glad I did. I'm really, really glad I did."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I understand surgery is often included as part of the treatment plan for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>. If I'm a candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> but am also considering a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a>, what are some things I should keep in mind? Should my breast density be a factor in my decision-making?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Women diagnosed with breast cancer are almost immediately confronted with treatment decisions. If your&amp;nbsp;surgical oncologist&amp;nbsp;gave you a choice between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy to remove a tumor, that's often because either option will lead to a similar long-term health outcome.</p>



<p>A lumpectomy is commonly known as breast conservation surgery because it keeps most of the breast intact, whereas a mastectomy removes the entire breast.&amp;nbsp;Regardless of which procedure you choose, the risk of breast cancer recurrence is roughly the same.</p>



<p>Lumpectomy is a treatment option for early-stage breast cancer.&amp;nbsp;Compared with a mastectomy, it's less invasive and tends to have a quicker recovery. It also can help preserve the cosmetic appearance and sensation of the breast. Your healthcare professional will recommend radiation therapy after a lumpectomy to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning in the breast.</p>



<p>A mastectomy removes the whole breast. In many cases, radiation therapy is not needed after mastectomy. Individuals&amp;nbsp;with a genetic predisposition for breast cancer, such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, may opt for a mastectomy as a preventive measure following their diagnosis.</p>



<p>After a mastectomy, some women choose to forgo <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-implants/about/pac-20384934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconstructive surgery</a>, opting for what is called an aesthetic flat closure.&amp;nbsp;There can be many reasons for this, including wanting to limit future surgeries, reducing risks and complications, and desiring a faster return to daily life and activities.</p>



<p>For other patients, having a breast mound is part of how they identify as women.&amp;nbsp;Multiple types of breast reconstruction procedures are available following either a lumpectomy or mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery can occur at the same time as breast cancer surgery, or you can plan your reconstruction weeks, months or years after treatment.</p>



<p>The surgical technique and cosmetic outcomes after mastectomy and reconstruction have improved over the past 20 years. More women can keep their nipple and areolar complex and, in many cases, a procedure can be performed to help improve sensation to the nipple and areolar complex.<br><br>Breast density also could be a factor in your decision-making. About half of people who have screening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammograms</a> have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breasts</a>. Dense breast tissue is harder to see through on a mammogram image. Having dense breast tissue should not affect one's decision to undergo a mastectomy or lumpectomy.</p>



<p>However, dense breast tissue may influence the need for additional tests before surgery, such as an MRI. An MRI looks for abnormal blood flow within the breast and can "see through" dense tissue. This may help surgeons better determine the extent of disease and guide them in the removal.</p>



<p>Ultimately, determining the option that is best for you is a nuanced decision that can be based on a variety of factors, including cancer-based reasons, family history and genetics, and peace of mind. Choosing which surgical route to take is deeply personal, and there is no one "best choice" for every woman. After careful consideration and&amp;nbsp;consultation with your healthcare team, you should make the decision that you determine is best for you, based on the specifics of your cancer and your individual needs and preferences. <strong>— </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mclaughlin-sarah-a-m-d/bio-20055048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Sarah McLaughlin, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

<p><em>Researchers are leading the nation in developing powerful and precise radiopharmaceutical theranostics</em><strong> </strong><em>intended to treat people with deadly cancers. &amp;nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> recently became the first institution to administer an investigational radioactive medicine to a patient with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer. The investigational medicine is a targeted <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiopharmaceutic/about/pac-20587480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiopharmaceutical</a> theranostic (RPT) that is designed to target a novel protein called glypican-3 (GPC3). The RPT was administered to the patient as part of a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20583570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-in-human clinical trial</a> for the targeted therapy. This investigational RPT includes both a diagnostic imaging agent, intended to identify the cancer cells, and a therapeutic agent, intended to target and kill cancer cells.</p>



<p>GPC3 was identified as a potentially viable and promising target because it is produced at higher levels in HCC tissue than in a normal, healthy adult liver. It is also considered an oncofetal cell surface protein because GPC3 is normally only active during fetal development. In adults, the protein is turned off, but when cancer forms, it "reawakens" the protein to support rapid growth and evade the immune system. This means that GPC3 is found only on cancer cells, which makes it a strong potential target for treatment. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>With this knowledge, Mayo Clinic researchers are participating in a first-in-human clinical trial investigating alpha-emitting RPTs, which use alpha particle radiation to precisely and powerfully diagnose, target, and potentially kill cancer cells. In this trial, the RPT includes an agent that binds to GPC3.</p>



<p>The phase 1/1b study is being conducted at all three academic Mayo Clinic sites in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester</a>; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona/campus-buildings-maps/mayo-clinic-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix</a>; and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. The first person to receive the clinical trial procedure was at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>"Whole-body GPC3 targeted molecular imaging shows high localization to the tumor and minimal accumulation in normal tissues, indicating that the therapeutic radiation effects will be limited to sites of disease," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parent-ephraim-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20445440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ephraim Parent, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a radiologist and division chair of Nuclear Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Florida. Dr. Parent is co-principal investigator on the trial.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic in Florida researchers recently <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-treats-first-person-in-the-us-with-a-novel-radiopharmaceutical-therapy-for-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were the first in the U.S. to apply</a> an investigational alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy in a treatment setting to a patient living with metastatic breast cancer. Mayo Clinic has now marked another remarkable first by delivering a different novel alpha-emitting investigational therapy to a patient with liver cancer, the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, we are committed to advancing innovative therapies that expand possibilities for those facing this devastating disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kankeu-fonkoua-lionel-a-m-d/bio-20512666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lionel Kankeu Fonkoua, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and principal investigator of the trial. "Being able to offer access to this novel radiopharmaceutical approach reflects our dedication to pushing the boundaries of liver cancer care."</p>



<p>The drug for the study is being developed by RayzeBio Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb Company, the sponsor of the active phase 1/1b clinical trial.</p>

<p>"The first thing to know if you get notified is that dense breast tissue is completely normal.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of all women will have dense tissue," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>He says dense breasts are identified through a mammogram. Additional testing is the next step.</p>



<p>"The most widely available supplemental screening test for women with dense tissues is probably an ultrasound of the breast or an MRI," says Dr. Sharpe. "There have been lots of studies showing that MRI is the most sensitive test for finding breast cancer."</p>



<p>An MRI is meant to be used along with a mammogram, not instead.</p>



<p>"MRI is the most sensitive test we have for finding breast cancer. It can see through density. It can find hard-to-see, small cancers," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>But it's not for everyone. You'll lie face down on a table and then guided into the MRI machine."Some patients that have challenges with claustrophobia might struggle to be comfortable in the smaller space&amp;nbsp;of the MRI scanner," explains Dr. Sharpe.</p>

<p>The benefit is clear, he says.</p>



<p>"Women with dense tissue or high risk for breast cancer that undergo breast MRI, we are able to see cancers that would be hiding from the mammogram."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supplemental screening options</h2>



<p>Other supplemental screening options include&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging (MBI)</a>, ultrasound and contrast-enhanced mammography.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Sharpe says choosing what screening method works for you is an individual decision that should be made with your healthcare team, but he says it's important to start with your annual screening.</p>



<p>"The most important thing for women to know is that you should get your annual mammogram, starting at age 40. Also, if you have dense tissue, consider a supplemental screening, another imaging test looking at the breast tissues in a different way — and you should get that exam regularly as well," he says.</p>

<p>Breast cancer receives much attention during October's awareness month. Although sightings of pink ribbons and breast cancer-related information increase during the month, it's crucial to keep screenings and clinical breast exams at the forefront of preventive care year-round.</p>



<p>A Mayo Clinic Health System high-risk breast consultant and breast cancer awareness advocate shares the top&amp;nbsp;10 questions about breast cancer asked by people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Why do I need to worry about breast cancer and having routine mammograms?</strong><br>This is the most common question shared during breast clinic consultations. Many people mention that they don't have any family history of breast cancer. However, approximately just 20% of breast cancer is related to family history and genetic links. People are considered at the highest risk after a breast cancer diagnosis in a first-degree relative, such as a mom or sister.</li>



<li><strong>What can I do to prevent breast cancer from developing?</strong><br>For most people, the answer is to live a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, minimizing alcohol consumption and maintaining an ideal body weight through diet and exercise. The majority of the risk for breast cancer comes from being female, having breasts and aging.</li>



<li><strong>What steps can I take to be informed of my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>This answer has two parts. The first part is to learn about your family's medical history. The second part is to follow your healthcare team's recommended preventive screening plan, including a mammogram if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Should I continue doing self-checks of my breasts and have an annual clinical breast exam?</strong><br>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce update breast screening recommendations annually, but more research studies need to be done. Your health history and conversations with your healthcare team will help inform the best approach for you. Although not all healthcare professionals perform a yearly clinical breast exam as part of an annual physical, you may choose to perform monthly or quarterly self-checks to increase your breast awareness. Both a yearly breast exam by a medical professional and regular self-checks are recommended if you have a higher risk of breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>What does it mean to have dense breasts, and how does that affect mammograms?</strong><br>Approximately 30% of people have moderately dense breasts and up to 10% have extremely dense breasts. While dense breast tissue does affect the detection of breast cancer through mammography, a mammogram is still a recommended annual screening starting at age 40 for people with average breast cancer risk.</li>



<li><strong>Does taking a birth control pill increase my risk of developing breast cancer?<br></strong>No strong connection has been identified to suggest any such connection in average-risk patients during childbearing years. However, studies suggest that continuing hormone therapy after age 60 can increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Does pregnancy and breastfeeding increase my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>No, it's quite the opposite. The risk of developing breast cancer decreases based on the duration of time spent pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>



<li><strong>How do environmental toxin exposure and radiation affect breast cancer?<br></strong>Certain factors, such as radiation exposure from previous cancer treatment, working in an environment with toxins, or other radiation exposure can increase your risk of many cancer types, including breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Should I have genetic testing to determine if I have a family-related risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>The short answer is, for some people, yes. However, genetic testing is recommended only after a discussion with your healthcare team or breast specialist about your cancer risks. You may be asked to meet with a genetics counselor to ensure that there is a strong indication for testing.</li>



<li><strong>Does my age affect my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>Yes. Age is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. As people get older, genetic changes and lifetime hormone exposure can increase risk. Aging is one of several risk factors you cannot change, along with family history and breast density. Because risk rises over time, it’s important to follow screening recommendations and maintain healthy habits such as staying active and limiting alcohol.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you have been identified as having a higher risk of breast cancer and referred to a high-risk breast clinic, you can expect a comprehensive meeting with a healthcare professional who is skilled and passionate about breast cancer prevention and survivorship.</p>

<p>She and her research team studied 2,978 women with dense breasts between 40-75 years&amp;nbsp;old at five separate centers. The study participants received two annual breast cancer screenings that included the combination of a supplemental MBI test and a 3D mammogram, also called digital breast tomosynthesis.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Breast radiologists detected more cancerous tissue from the combined MBI and mammography screenings compared to either technique alone.</p>



<p>"MBI is a fairly simple, low cost and safe option for women who have dense breasts and are seeking a supplemental screening test," says Dr. Hruska. <br><br>MBI combined with a mammogram is available at about 30 sites in the U.S., including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a>; and Mayo Clinic campuses in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacksonville, Florida</a>.<br></p>

<p>With more screening, there is a risk of being called back for additional testing to evaluate the findings. The researchers were pleased to find that although the addition of MBI to mammography led to 279 more women being called back in the first year of screening, this rate of callbacks decreased by half in the second round of screening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps to improve breast cancer screening</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Hruska's team is working on developing an algorithm that would cut the time it takes from 40 minutes to about 20 minutes or less to capture an image using this technique. This would make it more comfortable for women and enable more women to schedule this screening.</p>

<p><em>From early detection to targeted therapies, breast cancer survival has reached record highs — with Mayo Clinic leading what's next.</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — For more than 40 years, Mayo Clinic has been at the forefront of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> innovation, transforming a once-limited diagnosis into a story of record survival rates, groundbreaking therapies and renewing hope for millions of patients worldwide. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Detecting cancer earlier</strong></h2>



<p>Mammography revolutionized breast cancer care in the 1980s by finding tumors earlier, making them more treatable. Advances in digital mammography and 3D tomosynthesis have since improved accuracy, reduced false alarms and revealed cancers hidden in dense breast tissue.</p>



<p>Genetic testing has also reshaped care. Discoveries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations — and later, additional <a href="https://perspectivesinmedicine.cshlp.org/content/14/8/a041318" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">genetic markers</a> — have allowed healthcare teams to personalize screening and prevention. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> researchers, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yadav-siddhartha-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20489847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Siddhartha Yadav, M.B.B.S., M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>, have helped refine <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2005936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">risk predictions</a> so patients and care teams can make more informed choices about surgery, surveillance or medication.</p>



<p>"By offering more precise, individualized risk estimates, our work supports shared decision-making between patients and their care teams to reduce the risk of breast cancer," says Dr. Yadav, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist. He is expanding this work to better understand how inherited genetic changes influence tumor biology, treatment response and long-term outcomes in breast and ovarian cancers.</p>



<p>New tools such as <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/rg.2021200167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contrast-enhanced digital mammography</a>, which uses a special dye along with mammography, are showing promise in detecting cancers that traditional scans may miss. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/patel-bhavika-m-d/bio-20130475" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bhavika Patel, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiologist, is leading clinical trials that show its potential to move toward more personalized screening. "We aim to match the right test to the right woman at the right time because earlier detection means treatment can start sooner, which improves outcomes and saves lives," says Dr. Patel.</p>



<p>Dr. Yadav and Dr. Patel predict that over the next 10 years, risk assessment and breast imaging will work together to become even more personalized and integrated with artificial intelligence (AI) to tailor care and improve outcomes for every patient.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding breast cancer subtypes</strong></h2>



<p>In the 1990s, researchers discovered that breast cancer is a collection of biologically distinct subtypes: hormone receptor–positive, HER2-positive and <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/381/bmj-2022-071674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">triple-negative breast cancer</a> (TNBC). This opened the door to more personalized treatment.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, researchers are now pushing this even further with studies led by breast medical oncologists <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/leon-ferre-roberto-a-m-d/bio-20463845" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roberto Leon-Ferre, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goetz-matthew-p-m-d/bio-00027285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Goetz, M.D.</a>, that <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-study-finds-triple-negative-breast-cancer-tumors-with-an-increase-in-immune-cells-have-lower-risk-of-recurrence-after-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggest</a> people who have early-stage TNBC and high levels of immune cells within their tumors (called immune infiltrating cells or TILs) may have a lower risk of recurrence and better survival rates even when not treated with chemotherapy.</p>



<p>Based on this work, Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Laboratory of Medicine and Pathology</a> routinely reports TILs in all patients with early-stage TNBC. And Dr. Leon-Ferre and Dr. Goetz are developing a national clinical trial to evaluate TIL levels in patients with stage 1 TNBC. "The data will inform whether patients need or do not need chemotherapy, and could change standard practice," says Dr. Leon-Ferre.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New treatments, better outcomes</strong></h2>



<p>Tamoxifen was one of the first breakthroughs in hormone-targeted therapy. Two decades later, trastuzumab transformed outcomes for HER2-positive breast cancer. And new classes of drugs — including hormone therapies like aromatase inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors, PARP inhibitors and immunotherapies — have dramatically extended survival for many patients.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers are leading national trials of next-generation therapies, like Dr. Goetz's study of drugs that more effectively block or degrade the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/endo/article/162/12/bqab191/6364076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">estrogen receptor</a>. Other trials are testing whether lower doses of tamoxifen can reduce side effects while still decreasing risk of further breast cancer events.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/haddad-tufia-c-m-d/bio-20055534" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tufia Haddad, M.D.</a>, breast medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center, is leading efforts to identify novel therapies to transform cancer care, such as showing the Aurora A kinase inhibitor, alisertib, <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaoncology/fullarticle/2802267" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">can reduce or eradicate breast cancer</a> stem cells within a tumor to shrink or stabilize the disease.&nbsp;Such work was enabled by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/d-assoro-tony-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027386">Tony D’Assoro, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, an oncology scientist at Mayo Clinic, who discovered the novel non-Mitotic role of Aurora-A Kinase in promoting the enrichment of cancer stem cells and provided the therapeutic rationale for the clinical development of alisertib. Dr. Haddad&nbsp;is now studying it in combination with different endocrine therapies, in hopes that a lower dose with fewer side effects will be better for patients.</p>



<p>Further, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chumsri-saranya-m-d/bio-20114242" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saranya Chumsri, M.D.</a>, also a breast medical oncologist at the cancer center, is leading vaccine clinical trials in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/26/5/1045/83151/Rapid-Generation-of-Sustainable-HER2-specific-T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HER2-positive</a> and TNBC that may one day prevent cancer from returning altogether.</p>



<p>"In 10 years, we will see growth of a new class of targeted treatment approaches to intercept cancer that is detected at a microscopic stage. Preventing cancer will become the new cure," says Dr. Haddad.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Smarter chemotherapy and genomic testing</strong></h2>

<p>Chemotherapy has become smarter and more tolerable with advances like shorter intervals between chemotherapy cycles and better supportive care. Mayo Clinic researchers are now exploring optimized treatment schedules and new combinations.</p>



<p>Genomic tests such as <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33444922/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oncotype DX</a> analyze tumor biology to predict whether chemotherapy will help, sparing many women from unnecessary treatment. Liquid biopsies — blood tests that detect cancer DNA — are beginning to guide real-time treatment decisions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advances in surgery and radiation</strong></h2>



<p>Surgery and radiation also have evolved with a focus on survival and quality of life. Research proved that breast-conserving surgery with radiation was as effective as mastectomy, and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1245/s10434-024-15715-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentinel lymph node surgery</a> reduced the need for extensive operations, sparing many patients from long-term complications.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A future of hope</strong></h2>



<p>Since 1989, breast cancer deaths in the U.S. have dropped nearly 40%. That progress is the result of decades of discovery — better imaging, smarter drugs, less invasive surgery and personalized medicine.</p>



<p>"Breast cancer care is one of the fastest-evolving areas in medicine," says Dr. Boughey. "Every clinical trial takes another step forward to improve outcomes and reduce side effects for patients."</p>



<p>For patients with breast cancer and their families, the last four decades tell a story of hope: survival is higher than ever, treatment is more personalized, and the future has never looked brighter.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new international study led by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;researchers has identified a genetic factor that may explain why some patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a>&nbsp;that has spread to the liver experience more severe liver damage after chemotherapy.</p>



<p>For patients with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stage-4-colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20584697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal liver metastases</a>, surgery offers the best chance of long-term survival. To improve outcomes, many patients receive chemotherapy before surgery. While this approach can shrink tumors to make them more operable, one potential side effect is injury to the liver. Until now, it hasn't been clear why certain patients' livers are more prone to chemotherapy-associated liver injury.</p>



<p>"This is the first study to clearly show that a genetic predisposition plays a significant role in how the liver tolerates chemotherapy," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starlinger-patrick-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Starlinger, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&amp;nbsp;hepatobiliary and pancreas surgeon and senior author of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/ebiom/article/PIIS2352-3964(25)00372-X/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&amp;nbsp;published in The Lancet eBioMedicine.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers reviewed 551 patients who had chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. They looked at liver health tests to see how chemotherapy affected liver function and genetic markers that are already linked to liver disease in other settings.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>They found that a specific gene variant in the PNPLA3 gene, which is known to affect fat metabolism in the liver, was strongly linked to liver injury after chemotherapy. Patients with two copies of this variant were especially vulnerable, and all of them developed signs of significant liver injury after chemotherapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Genetic differences help explain global variation</strong></h2>



<p>According to Dr. Starlinger, the PNPLA3 variant is common worldwide, but its prevalence differs by population. For example, in Japan, the mutation is present in more than 41% of the population. It's found in more than 71% among people of Peruvian descent, but fewer than 10% of people in some European populations have it.</p>



<p>Because the genetic variation is more common in certain groups, such as people of Asian or Latin American descent, this may help explain why previous studies in different countries have reported conflicting results about the benefits of giving chemotherapy before and/or after surgery when treating colorectal liver metastases.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Personalizing care to maximize benefit, minimize risk</strong></h2>



<p>The findings suggest that a blood test to check for the PNPLA3 variant, along with monitoring liver health, could help doctors identify patients at higher risk for liver damage from chemotherapy.</p>



<p>"These findings offer us insight into how we can adjust treatment strategies to best manage the care for patients diagnosed with colorectal liver metastases, while potentially avoiding a negative side effect of chemotherapy," says Dr. Starlinger. "Chemotherapy may still be an appropriate treatment option, and with this information, we can personalize treatment for each patient — for example, tailoring chemotherapy or allowing more time for the liver to recover before surgery."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> researchers will present their latest radiation oncology findings at the <a href="https://www.astro.org/meetings-and-education/micro-sites/2025/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) Annual Meeting</a>, scheduled to be held Sept. 27–Oct. 1 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The ASTRO Annual Meeting is recognized as the largest radiation oncology gathering in the world, and this year's event will feature 14 education sessions and 45 abstracts highlighting Mayo Clinic's advancements in radiation oncology.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's presentations this year span innovative clinical research, advanced imaging techniques and innovative treatment approaches that are reshaping radiation oncology and diversifying its benefits to patients.</p>



<p>Highlights of the event include:</p>



<p><a href="https://amportal.astro.org/sessions/pro-04-21554/liquid-biopsy-early-detection-of-cancer-106372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Education Session:</strong></a><strong> </strong>Liquid Biopsy Early Detection of Cancer<br><strong>Presentation time: </strong>Saturday, Sept. 27, 1:17–1:32 p.m. PDT<br><strong>Session title: </strong>PRO 04 - Liquid Biopsies in Cancer<br><strong>Description:</strong> Dr. Aadel Chaudhuri will co-lead this session highlighting Mayo Clinic's leadership in advancing liquid biopsy (circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA) technologies for cancer care, with a focus on clinical applications in post-treatment monitoring and early detection. The session is designed for clinicians and colleagues, emphasizing practical use, near-term innovations and Mayo's role in shaping precision medicine.<br><strong>PRESENTER: </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chaudhuri-aadel-a-m-d-ph-d/bio-20564708" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aadel Chaudhuri, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, radiation oncologist</p>



<p><a href="https://amportal.astro.org/sessions/ss-05-21603/mid-treatment-ctdna-to-predict-outcomes-in-stage-iib-iiic-nsclc-treated-with-mri-adapted-chem-106753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Scientific Session:</strong></a><strong> </strong>127 - Mid-Treatment ctDNA to Predict Outcomes in Stage IIB-IIIC NSCLC Treated with MRI-Adapted Chemoradiation<br><strong>Presentation time: </strong>Sunday, Sept. 28, 2:30–2:40 p.m. PDT<br><strong>Session title: </strong>SS 05 - Lung 1: NSCLC Locally Advanced and Oligometastatic<br><strong>Description: </strong>This study showed that a simple, Medicare-covered blood test could help care teams identify — before treatment begins — which patients with stage 3 lung cancer are most likely to benefit from treatment and which may be at higher risk of relapse. Repeating the test during the second week of therapy revealed early signs of whether treatment was working, well before changes appeared on scans. This could potentially create an opportunity to adjust treatment sooner, possibly sparing patients from ineffective therapy and added side effects.<br><strong>PRESENTER: </strong><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/liquid-biopsy-translational-immunogenomics/faculty-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ayesha Hashmi, M.D.</a>, postdoctoral research fellow, Radiation Oncology (senior author is Aadel Chaudhuri, M.D., Ph.D.)</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION:&amp;nbsp;</strong>I'm a guy in my late 40s and trying to pay more attention to my health. But I'm confused about whether I should be <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/prostate-cancer-screening-and-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screened</a> for prostate cancer. Can you help?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The importance of all health screenings is that they can detect issues early.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prostate cancer</a>&amp;nbsp;is one of the most common cancers in the world, and the second-leading cause of cancer deaths among men in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While many prostate cancers grow slowly and remain localized, other types are aggressive and spread quickly. Screening can find prostate cancer early, when it's still confined to the prostate gland. That's when patients have the best chance for successful treatment. If caught early (stage 1), the survival rate after five years is almost 100%. At stage 4, the survival rate is 37% to50% at the five-year mark.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>It's recommended that men begin talking about prostate cancer screening with a healthcare professional around age 50. During this discussion, you and your clinician will decide if the prostate-specific antigen test is right for you based on your personal risk level and age, as well as the chance of overdiagnosis or underdiagnosis, possible biopsy complications, and testing intervals.</p>



<p>The screening is relatively simple. The most common is a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/psa-test/about/pac-20384731?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test</a>. It's conducted by your primary care clinician once a year. Here's what you need to know about the PSA test:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>It's a blood test used to measure the amount of prostate-specific antigen in your blood.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>High levels may indicate the presence of cancer. However, other conditions may also increase this level.</li>



<li>Screening intervals are personalized. Based on test results, men with low long-term risk may decide to discontinue testing or lengthen the time between tests. Those with higher PSA levels may require more frequent screening.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who's at risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Risk factors include age, family history and race.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Age:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The risk for prostate cancer is highest beginning at age 50 or older.</p>



<p><strong>Family history:</strong>&amp;nbsp;If you have a blood relative who has or has had prostate cancer, a family history of genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 that increase the risk of breast cancer, or a strong family history of breast cancer, your risk may be higher.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Race:</strong>&amp;nbsp;In the U.S., prostate cancer is deadlier for Black men than for men of other races. They're more likely to get prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to die from it than other men. Black men should consider being screened starting at age 40.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Active surveillance</strong></h2>



<p>Not all prostate cancers need to be treated — some can remain under&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/active-surveillance-for-prostate-cancer/about/pac-20384946?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active surveillance</a>. When prostate cancer is found early, it can be watched for many years. If it becomes aggressive, treatment can begin. In active surveillance, regular follow-up tests may be performed to monitor the progression of your cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment options</strong></h2>



<p>Along with active surveillance, a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353097?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full range</a>&amp;nbsp;of treatments for prostate cancer is available, including radiation, hormone therapy, chemotherapy, cryosurgery and surgery, including robotic removal of all or part of the prostate.</p>



<p>Many patients who have just a few sites of metastatic disease, meaning that the cancer isn't widely spread, also can benefit from aggressive treatment. This treatment combines radiation and oral or IV cancer medication therapy to put the cancer into remission and extend the patient's life.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Another radiation technique includes intensity-modulated&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488">proton b</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">am therapy</a>&amp;nbsp;with pencil beam scanning. This localized treatment can minimize significant adverse events from the treatment.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare professional to learn more about prostate cancer screening and if it's right for you.</p>
