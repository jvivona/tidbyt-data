<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>I've always been active, but after being diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> and starting my treatment, I'm a little worried about getting back into my routine. Is it OK to exercise during cancer treatment?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Exercise <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/cancer-prevention/art-20044816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decreases</a> the risk of developing cancer. Studies have shown there is a 30%- 35% reduction in the risk of breast cancer among the most physically active women compared with those who are least active. Exercise also plays a protective role in many other cancers, including lung, endometrial, colon, kidney, bladder and esophageal<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/cancer-survivor/art-20044015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise</a> can also be helpful during and after cancer treatment. According to the American Cancer Society, research shows that exercise during cancer treatment can improve physical functioning and quality of life.</p>



<p>Moderate exercise can:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Increase strength and endurance.</li>



<li>Strengthen the cardiovascular system.</li>



<li>Reduce depression.</li>



<li>Decrease anxiety.</li>



<li>Diminish fatigue.</li>



<li>Improve mood.</li>



<li>Raise self-esteem.</li>



<li>Lessen pain.</li>



<li>Improve sleep.</li>
</ul>



<p>Of course, there may be certain issues that prevent or affect a person's ability to exercise due to disease or type of treatment, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Anemia — having a low number of red blood cells or quantity of hemoglobin or protein.</li>



<li>Weak immune system.</li>



<li>Some forms of radiation treatment.</li>



<li>Some surgeries limit certain exercises.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some people should use extra care to reduce the risk of injury, including <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-aging-and-the-benefits-of-exercising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older people</a> and those with bone disease, arthritis, or nerve damage, also called peripheral neuropathy.</p>



<p>Exciting studies show that regular physical activity is linked to increased life expectancy after a cancer diagnosis. In many cases, it also decreases the risk of cancer recurrence. Multiple studies in cancer survivors, with the strongest evidence in breast and colon cancer survivors, have suggested that physically active cancer survivors have a lower risk of cancer recurrence and improved survival compared with those who are inactive.</p>



<p>The American Cancer Society, the American Institute for Cancer Research, the American College of Sports Medicine, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services all advocate physical activity for cancer patients and survivors.</p>



<p>The American Cancer Society recommends cancer survivors take these actions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Participate in regular physical activity.</li>



<li>Avoid inactivity and return to normal daily activities as soon as possible after diagnosis.</li>



<li>Exercise at least 150 minutes per week.</li>



<li>Include strength training exercises at least two days per week.</li>
</ul>



<p>Not everyone is ready to head to the gym during or after cancer therapy. However, reconnecting with an activity you like to do can increase your enjoyment and ability to stick with an exercise program. Exercise may include a bike ride with friends or chasing your dog around the park.</p>



<p>Walking is a great activity for almost everyone, and swimming can be a wonderful alternative for those with joint issues. Yoga is fantastic for strengthening, flexibility and balance concerns.</p>

<p><br>For years, cancer researchers have been trying to halt a type of molecule that's involved in several cancers. The molecules — enzymes known as trypsins — split proteins that help tumors grow and spread.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="450" height="600" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Evette-Radisky.vert_.crop_.jpg" alt="Portrait of Dr. Evette Radisky" class="wp-image-405578" style="width:270px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Evette-Radisky.vert_.crop_.jpg 450w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Evette-Radisky.vert_.crop_-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Evette Radisky, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mayo Clinic cancer biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/radisky-evette-s-ph-d/bio-00094471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evette Radisky, Ph.D.</a>, previously found that one trypsin, called mesotrypsin, plays a role in breast, prostate, pancreatic and lung cancer. Like other enzymes, the molecule has an active site that kicks off reactions with other molecules. Researchers have tried to block the active site but haven’t found a molecule with a specific enough lock-and-key fit to jam the active region.</p>



<p>Recently, however, Dr. Radisky's lab at Mayo Clinic in Florida discovered a new way to block mesotrypsin. They found a "hidden pocket" in the molecule.</p>



<p>"The hidden pocket is separate from the active site, but we found that blocking it has a similar effect of locking the enzyme in an inactive state," says Dr. Radisky, principal investigator of the study that appeared in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu9129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Advances</a>. The team now is taking steps to discover drugs that fit the hidden pocket.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A mystery in the data</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Coban-Mathew-A._16094085_202109280353.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-405580" style="width:276px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Coban-Mathew-A._16094085_202109280353.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Coban-Mathew-A._16094085_202109280353-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mathew Coban</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"It was a serendipitous finding," says the study’s lead author, Mathew Coban, of the pocket's discovery. As a research technologist in the Radisky lab and a master's degree student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, Coban had aimed to understand the structure of mesotrypsin through X-ray crystallography.</p>



<p>The complex technique, which records scattered X-rays as shadows, can describe the overall folds of amino acids in the enzyme and suggest complementary molecules that fit like a puzzle. While reviewing the X-ray crystallography results, Coban noticed a segment of the enzyme that looked out of place. The research team thought it might be an error in the data and set the results aside.</p>



<p>But Coban continued to wonder about the strange area. He had the idea to begin looking for alternate nooks in the mesotrypsin enzyme that could potentially contribute to a stable, non-active enzyme.</p>



<p>What Coban found was a site that was hidden. The team dubbed it a "cryptic pocket." The pocket, adjacent to the active site, opened at moments when mesotrypsin stabilized itself. The next step was clear. "If the pocket is there some of the time, maybe a drug would be able to bind at that site and trap the enzyme in its inactive state," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Finding a drug that binds</strong></h2>



<p>The team worked with a colleague, Thomas Caulfield, Ph.D., a former Mayo researcher and drug discovery expert, to conduct a computational screen of potential drug compounds that might fit in the cryptic pocket. They found a single molecule that could bind in the cryptic pocket and inhibit the activity of mesotrypsin.</p>



<p>Importantly, the researchers note, the molecule blocks mesotrypsin selectively, without affecting other trypsins. This could mean less toxicity or fewer side effects for a patient. The finding also means that other cryptic pockets may exist in other trypsin molecules related to cancer, presenting new potential drug targets. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The team is continuing to look for drug molecules that fit mesotrypsin even better. "Based on the structural information of mesotrypsin that we have now, we've been able to do more computational prediction to identify additional, more potent compounds that we’re now testing in the laboratory," says Dr. Radisky.</p>



<p>"This has been an important step in the understanding of this key enzyme. Our next steps will be to start testing how well our candidate drug molecules fit the cryptic pocket and block cancer invasion and metastasis in models of disease," she says.</p>



<p><em>The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program and Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility. &nbsp;The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</em></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I received a notice from my health system that I'm due for a colorectal cancer screening. I'm 45. Do I really need to have this done now?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>It's easy to be confused or overwhelmed by screening recommendations for common types of cancer. Your healthcare team is a trusted resource for keeping you up to date on screenings, including screening for colorectal cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why, when and how should you be screened for this cancer? Test your knowledge of colon cancer screening with these myths and facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Colorectal cancer is rare.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Myth:</strong>&nbsp;Colorectal cancer is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/colon-rectal-cancer/about/key-statistics.html#:~:text=Deaths%20from%20colorectal%20cancer,about%2052%2C550%20deaths%20during%202023." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second-leading cause</a>&nbsp;of cancer-related death in men and women combined. Roughly 1 in 26 women will have colorectal cancer, and about 1 in 24 men will have colorectal cancer. To put that in perspective, when watching a football game, of all the players on the field, about one player would be diagnosed with colorectal cancer in their lifetime.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Colorectal cancer can happen when you're young.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The rate of colorectal cancer is increasing in people under 50. Rates of colorectal cancer in people under 50 have doubled since 1990. In people over 65, the diagnosis rates have been decreasing, most likely because of colorectal cancer screening.</p>



<p>Many younger adults don't consider themselves at risk. That's why it's especially important to know the&nbsp;<a href="https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/115/8/909/7147891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warning signs</a>&nbsp;of colorectal cancer and not put off getting medical attention. Early diagnosis is essential to surviving colorectal cancer. If this cancer is found when it's only in the colon or rectum, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. That survival rate drops to roughly 15% if the cancer spreads beyond the colon and rectum.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Screening for colorectal cancer starts at age 45.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;In 2021, the recommendation for colorectal cancer was updated to begin screening at age 45. This is because the rate of diagnosis is increasing at younger ages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Colorectal cancer can be prevented with screening.</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The goal of colorectal cancer screening is to prevent cancer, not just find it when it has already developed. Most colorectal cancer develops from a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/polyps-colon-cancer-culprits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyp</a>, a small, precancerous growth. The presence of polyps can easily be identified using colonoscopy screening tests. Polyps can be removed during a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/what-to-expect-before-and-during-a-colonoscopy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>&nbsp;to prevent them from developing into cancer.</p>



<p>You can also help keep your colon healthy by:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Add bulk to your diet with lots of veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li>Eat healthy fats found in olive oil, salmon, avocados and nuts.</li>



<li>Strive for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.</li>



<li>Watch your weight. Carrying extra pounds has been shown to increase your risk for colon cancer.</li>



<li>Drink alcohol in moderation, and don't smoke.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Family history is the only risk factor for colorectal cancer.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Myth:</strong>&nbsp;While a family history of colorectal cancer influences your risk of developing cancer, other important risk factors increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Medical conditions including obesity and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/differences-between-ibd-and-ibs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a> (IBD), and lifestyle choices, such as a diet high in red meats, smoking and alcohol use, increase risk. Because colorectal cancer is common, all adults over 45 should be screened regardless of family history.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>African Americans have a higher risk of developing colorectal cancer, and American Indian/Alaska Native people have the highest risk of colorectal cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A positive stool-based screening for colorectal cancer is the same as a cancer diagnosis.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p><strong>Myth:</strong>&nbsp;A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-questions-about-stool-dna-tests-for-colon-cancer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stool-based test</a>&nbsp;looks for more than cancer, and it can identify precancerous lesions or polyps. These tests don't address the polyp if a polyp is present in the colon. A follow-up colonoscopy is needed to identify the polyp and potentially remove it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>When Dr. Bobby Mukkamala found himself on the other side of the exam table, he relied on the cutting-edge surgical techniques at Mayo Clinic to get him back to his professional work.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>While presenting at a professional meeting, Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, normally an eloquent speaker, began speaking incoherently for about 90 seconds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Given my age of 53 at the time, I thought it was a 'senior moment,'" says Dr. Mukkamala, an otolaryngologist and head and neck surgeon from Flint, Michigan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His colleagues suspected he was having a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-things-to-know-about-stroke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> and convinced Dr. Mukkamala to go to a nearby emergency department for evaluation. Doctors suggested he may have had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/transient-ischemic-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20355679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transient ischemic attack</a>, or ministroke. They recommended an MRI when he returned home.</p>



<p>That scan revealed something far more serious: a brain tumor. His journey as a patient had begun — and it would ultimately lead him to Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Finding the right brain cancer care</strong></h2>



<p>After sharing the news with his family, Dr. Mukkamala tapped into his professional network. "Within a week of my diagnosis, I had half a dozen Zoom calls with neurosurgeons around the country," he says. "They were all wonderful with similar but slightly different perspectives on how to approach my case."<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:29% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Parney_Ian_F._MD_PhD_15095771_201805180159.jpg" alt="Dr. Ian Parney" class="wp-image-375694 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Parney_Ian_F._MD_PhD_15095771_201805180159.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/Parney_Ian_F._MD_PhD_15095771_201805180159-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>One call, however, stood out — his conversation with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parney-ian-f-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055129?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=yext&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=featureneuro&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=neuro&amp;cauid=102836&amp;y_source=1_MzkzMTA2Ny00ODMtbG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ian Parney</a>, (pictured here) a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota and member of Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>
</div></div>



<p><br>Dr. Parney knew the tumor was large, complex and near critical speech areas in the brain. "It was important to Dr. Mukkamala to protect those areas," says Dr. Parney.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike other surgeons who recommended two brain surgeries, Dr. Parney recommended a single<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/awake-brain-surgery/about/pac-20384913'" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> awake craniotomy</a> with speech mapping. During the procedure, the patient answers questions, and brain activity is monitored. This helps surgeons avoid damaging parts of the brain responsible for speech. His extensive experience — about 200 similar brain tumor procedures per year — gave hope to Dr. Mukkamala that the single operation was the best choice.</p>



<p>"Dr. Parney spent time answering every question we had," Dr. Mukkamala says. "That is what healthcare should be. As soon as we got off the call, my wife and kids said, 'That's it. That's where you're going.'"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using advanced surgical techniques to guide care</strong></h2>



<p>In December 2024, Dr. Mukkamala underwent an awake craniotomy with speech mapping. The surgical team also used an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/intraoperative-magnetic-resonance-imaging/about/pac-20394451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intraoperative MRI</a>. This advanced imaging technique provides real-time, high-resolution MRI scans while the surgery is in progress.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We do an MRI during the procedure to get the most accurate image so that we can remove the tumor safely," says Dr. Parney. Integrating functional imaging into image-guided systems in the operating room is a technique that Dr. Parney's team develops and tests to improve patient safety. He also correlates these techniques with novel strategies such as intraoperative electrophysiological mapping (using electrodes or electrical simulation to identify and preserve functions) and fluorescence-guided resection.</p>



<p>In Dr. Mukkamala's case, as part of the speech mapping,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ince-nuri-f-ph-d/bio-20562159" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nuri Ince</a>, a professor of neurosurgery and biomedical engineering at Mayo Clinic, provided a novel electrocorticography technique that showed critical areas of function without requiring direct cortical stimulation (electrical signals to the brain's outer layer), as is usually necessary.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

Right: Post-operative MRI showing resection cavity (black) and resolution of brain stem compression</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Parney and his colleagues were able to remove more than 90% of Dr. Mukkamala's tumor without damaging the speech areas. Six weeks after surgery, he was once again speaking professionally and confidently to large groups.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Coordinating multidisciplinary cancer care</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Mukkamala's cancerous brain tumor was a low-grade IDH-mutant <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/astrocytoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20576675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">astrocytoma</a>. This type of brain tumor arises from astrocytes (a type of glial cell in the brain) and carries a mutation in the IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase) gene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After surgery, Dr. Mukkamala met&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sener-ugur-t-m-d/bio-20534761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ugur Sener</a>, a neuro-oncologist at Mayo Clinic, who prescribed a new targeted drug to treat any remaining cancerous cells. The less toxic therapy allowed Dr. Mukkamala to avoid chemotherapy and radiation, which are standard treatments for brain cancer that can cause side effects such as fatigue and nausea.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We've built one of the largest brain tumor practices in the world here at Mayo," Dr. Parney says. "We have the right resources and the right teams in place to provide cutting-edge therapies and holistic care."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bringing new 'tumor wisdom' to the bedside</strong></h2>



<p>While his life today looks much like it did before his diagnosis, Dr. Mukkamala says his perspective is forever changed by his experience. "I used to be more science than emotion, but I've learned there's room for both," he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Mukkamala was alone when he received the news that he had cancer, much like most of his patients were when he delivered hard news. "It never occurred to me before that it was a problem to share a diagnosis when a patient was alone," Dr. Mukkamala says. He now tries to ensure his patients have support.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It's one of the many lessons he attributes to "tumor wisdom." "My brain may be a little smaller," says Dr. Mukkamala, "but I think it's happier and wiser."</p>

<p><em>Researchers are leading the nation in using powerful and precise radioactive drugs to treat people with complex cancers. &nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> has treated the first person in the U.S. using a novel radioactive medicine for advanced breast cancer as part of an international multisite <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>.</p>



<p>The medicine used in this clinical trial contains actinium-225, a highly potent alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy that was first developed for a subtype of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which are rare and can form in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract. The alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy is intended to work by passing through the blood to stick to cancer cells, delivering powerful and precise radiation without harming healthy cells.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic researchers are the first to apply this therapy in America to a patient with metastatic breast cancer. The phase 1b/2 open-label trial is being conducted at all three academic Mayo Clinic sites in Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix; Jacksonville, Florida; and approximately 20 other sites across the U.S. The first person treated was at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>

<p>The principal investigator at Mayo Clinic is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoffrey Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a professor of radiology and a leader in radiopharmaceutical therapies. He says these are innovative cancer treatments that use radioactive medicines designed to target and kill cancer cells with high precision.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has nearly 20 active radiopharmaceutical therapy clinical trials, with 10 more preparing to launch, targeting many different types of cancer. Mayo Clinic in Rochester treats more patients with modern radiopharmaceutical therapies, such as lutetium dotatate for neuroendocrine cancers and lutetium PSMA for prostate cancers, than any other center in the world.</p>



<p>Lutetium dotatate and lutetium PSMA are beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals. They use beta particles, which are tiny subatomic particles, to radiate at a low level. In contrast, alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals use alpha particles that are 8,000 times more massive than beta particles, and travel only three cell diameters after they are emitted from the therapy.</p>



<p>"This means alpha emitters can deliver a much more powerful impact over a shorter distance. If you consider killing a cancer cell is like knocking down a brick wall, then the difference is like throwing a 10-pound dumbbell (beta) at the wall versus a fully loaded Mack truck (alpha)," says Dr. Johnson. "The alpha emitter's potential lies in its power and in its ability to precisely kill even a single cancer cell without injuring surrounding healthy tissue, making it a next-generation therapy."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.233408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a>, data indicates actinium-225 DOTATATE that targets the somatostatin receptor subtype 2expression demonstrated feasibility and potential efficacy for treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer in the laboratory. The drug was developed by RayzeBio Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb Company, the sponsor of the active phase 1b/2 clinical trial.</p>



<p><strong>Study Title</strong>: Phase 1b/2 Open-label Trial of 225Ac-DOTATATE (RYZ101) in Subjects with Estrogen Receptor-positive (ER+), Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, Locally Advanced and Unresectable or Metastatic Breast Cancer Expressing Somatostatin Receptors (SSTRs) and Progressed After Antibody-drug Conjugates And/or Chemotherapy (TRACY-1)</p>

<p></p>



<p>In April 2023, CV Rao had just returned from a work trip in Europe when he started experiencing abdominal pain on his right side. His wife, a doctor, recognized that he needed to see his primary care physician for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ultrasound/about/pac-20395177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultrasound scan</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the ultrasound didn't show anything, CV's care team ordered a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a>. The results were alarming — a 7 centimeter tumor, the size of a large peach, was in his liver.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It was a shock to the system," CV recalls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The initial diagnosis suggested intrahepatic <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-cholangiocarcinoma-and-how-is-it-treated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cholangiocarcinoma</a>, a rare and aggressive cancer of the bile ducts.</p>



<p>CV quickly received a PET scan, an MRI and a biopsy at a local hospital which confirmed those suspicions. Within eight days, CV was undergoing chemotherapy to shrink the tumor so he might be eligible for surgery.</p>



<p>After six cycles of chemotherapy, the tumor was reevaluated. The good news was that the cancer was responsive to chemotherapy, and the tumor had shrunk by about 50%. Unfortunately, because the tumor surrounded major blood vessels, local surgeons still deemed it inoperable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking a second opinion</strong></h2>



<p>Determined to explore all options, CV sought a second opinion at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I was working on 3D printing investments and kept running into Mayo's innovative approaches," he explains. "Everywhere I looked, they had this 3D printing effort where the surgeons were able to visualize what they were operating on using 3D printed organs."</p>



<p>This led him to believe that Mayo Clinic could offer a solution.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new hope</strong></h2>



<p>Six months after diagnosis, CV and his wife, Madhavi, sat across from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/malhi-harmeet-m-b-b-s/bio-20054991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harmeet Malhi</a>, M.B.B.S., a hepatologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.<br></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:29% auto"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="891" height="891" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Harmeet-Malhi-MBBS-1-x-1.jpg" alt="Harmeet Malhi, MBBS" class="wp-image-405018 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Harmeet-Malhi-MBBS-1-x-1.jpg 891w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Harmeet-Malhi-MBBS-1-x-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Harmeet-Malhi-MBBS-1-x-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Harmeet-Malhi-MBBS-1-x-1-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>"We want to give every patient every chance. Undergoing surgery was his best chance at being tumor-free."          </p>



<p>                                  Harmeet Malhi, M.B.B.S.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">

</blockquote>
</div></div>



<p><br>After reviewing his imaging and personalized treatment plan with Dr. Malhi, CV and his wife met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/starlinger-patrick-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20533712" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Starlinger</a>, M.D., Ph.D., a hepatobiliary and pancreas surgeon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Dr. Starlinger looked at me and said, 'You came to the right place. We can help you with this,'" CV remembers.</p>



<p>All three liver veins appeared to be involved. This type of tumor usually is not removable because there must be at least one vein to drain the liver, according to Dr. Starlinger.</p>



<p> </p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile" style="grid-template-columns:auto 36%"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p><br>"We told him to continue chemotherapy to maximize his response, aiming to get the tumor even smaller. And then we planned for advanced, complex liver surgery."         </p>



<p>                                              Patrick Starlinger, M.D.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="857" height="857" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Dr.-Patrick-Starlinger-1-x-1.jpg" alt="Dr. Patrick Starlinger" class="wp-image-405016 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Dr.-Patrick-Starlinger-1-x-1.jpg 857w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Dr.-Patrick-Starlinger-1-x-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Dr.-Patrick-Starlinger-1-x-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Dr.-Patrick-Starlinger-1-x-1-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 857px) 100vw, 857px"></figure></div>



<p><br>Although CV understood this would be a high-risk procedure, he remembers feeling reassured after speaking with Dr. Starlinger.</p>



<p>"Dr. Starlinger looked at his fellows and said, 'Would you say this is routine?' And they all said 'Yes, it's a routine surgery for us,'" CV says.</p>



<p>As a native of Austria, Dr. Starlinger explains, "In German, we have a word that means saying 'yes' to life, 'lebensbejahend,' and that's how CV approached this. Both CV and his wife had such positive attitudes and a willingness to fight this with all they had." </p>



<p>CV believes the same can be said of Dr. Starlinger's approach to his case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The very first day, Dr. Starlinger walked in with a positive attitude, which is one of the things that you realize you absolutely need to get through things like this," CV says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Resecting the unresectable</strong></h2>



<p>CV's surgery was scheduled for November 22, 2023,&nbsp;the day before Thanksgiving.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To prepare for the operation, Dr. Starlinger turned to a 3D printed model of CV's anatomy, just like the ones that had led CV to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"3D models are incredibly helpful in complex surgical procedures because they allow for optimized surgical planning prior to the actual surgery," Dr. Starlinger explains.</p>



<p>At 6 a.m. on Nov. 22, CV was taken back to the operating room for the complex, 4.5-hour surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We carefully dissected through the liver until we approached the right hepatic vein, which was really the critical portion of CV's operation," Dr. Starlinger says. "We had everything prepared to reimplant the only remaining liver vein, but with meticulous precision, using an ultrasound dissection device, we were ultimately able to peel the tumor off the majority of the right hepatic vein and perform a primary repair of the vessel."</p>



<p>Dr. Starlinger and the surgical team removed roughly 50% of CV's liver, along with the entire tumor. The surgery was a success.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Experiencing cherished milestones</strong></h2>



<p>Nearly two years after his diagnosis, CV is returning to the activities he loved. He has resumed skiing, attended his younger son's robotics competitions, and even traveled to Switzerland and Austria with his wife.&nbsp;<br></p>

<p>"I can't wait to see my older son graduate and drop him off at college," he shares with a smile. "We are in a stage of life where a lot of life events are happening. It's amazing to do these things that are important to the family."</p>



<p>These moments, once clouded by uncertainty, are now cherished milestones.</p>



<p>Reflecting on his care at Mayo Clinic, CV expresses deep gratitude to the team that provided him with expert and compassionate treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The Mayo Clinic staff is beyond what we've experienced elsewhere," he says. "During my seven days in the hospital, we interacted with many nurses, and through changes in shifts, it was just a uniformly amazing experience. Every, every single person we came in touch with was such a positive experience."</p>



<p>"We wish Dr. Starlinger the longest career possible because the number of lives he has and will save is incredible," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the American Cancer Society, someone in the U.S. is diagnosed with cancer every 15 seconds. That staggering statistic drives the urgent push for more patient-centered, accessible care models. But what does that look like in practice?</p>



<p>For Dr. Dronca, this mission is personal — her daughter's cancer diagnosis revealed just how taxing traditional care can be. Out of that experience came a passionate commitment to transform how and where cancer care is delivered.</p>



<p>"I think cancer care, part of the scariness of it is how unknown it is, how unfamiliar it is in its approach," said Dr. Kamal. "But what if we could soften it by making components of it actually feel as normal as we can?"</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's response: Cancer CARE (Connected Access and Remote Expertise) Beyond Walls, a new model offering expert care outside of hospital walls. The initiative minimizes travel and maximizes access by combining in-home services with a Mayo Clinic-based command center staffed by advanced practice providers, nurses and hospitalists. This team remotely coordinates care, ensuring seamless integration with each patient's medical history.</p>



<p>"I see that there is no choice every time I speak about Cancer CARE Beyond Walls," stated Dr. Dronca.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In today's world, "Patients live longer, they need more treatments and we have more cancer diagnoses. We're really being outpaced in our ability to offer treatment to everyone in our physical spaces. So, we either think creatively and design a system where we can get care to more patients and also make the care more patient-friendly, or we build more chemotherapy units."</p>



<p>At-home cancer care isn't just a vision — it's happening now. Join us as we explore this transformative approach to care and what it means for the future of oncology.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;Talking to loved ones about a recent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck cancer</a> diagnosis can be overwhelming. Of course, there is no one “right” or “wrong” way to handle these conversations — or&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/07/30/living-with-cancer-guidance-from-mayo-clinic-experts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adjusting to your life with cancer</a>. Everyone has their own pace, preferences and relationship patterns. But taking the time to consider your approach can help make these conversations more manageable.</p>



<p>If you have been diagnosed with a head and neck cancer, consider these tips to talk more openly with your loved ones.</p>



<p>Anxiety and fear are a natural response to a cancer diagnosis, says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/moore-eric-j-m-d/bio-20053794" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Moore, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and medical director, International, Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>“People justifiably want to know what this diagnosis means for them. Am I going to live? Is it going to require aggressive treatment?” he says. “One of the first things I say is to take a breath. There are specialists that are passionate about and have studied your disease. And the vast majority of cancers that are encountered are treatable and very many of them are likely curable.”</p>



<p>The next step is to learn as much as you can about your cancer diagnosis. If possible, Dr. Moore recommends having a loved one accompany you to appointments and take notes. That way, both you and your loved one have the opportunity to fully process and discuss the information shared.</p>



<p>From there, Dr. Moore says it is important to understand that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/head-and-neck-cancers/symptoms-causes/syc-20354171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">head and neck cancer</a>&nbsp;isn‘t a specific diagnosis. Rather, head and neck cancer is a general category that describes many different types of cancer that impact the head and neck region. Cancers in the mouth, tongue, tonsils, pharynx (throat), larynx (throat box), nasal cavity and other areas are all considered types of head and neck cancer.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/squamous-cell-carcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squamous cell carcinoma</a>&nbsp;— a type of cancer that develops in the skin cells that line the lips, sinuses, and inner mouth and throat — is one of the most common types of head and neck cancer. However, the incidence of oropharyngeal cancer is on the rise in the United States. Often involving the tonsils and base of the tongue,&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/04/25/less-is-more-the-new-approach-to-treating-hpv-related-throat-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oropharyngeal cancer is thought to be caused by exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV)</a>, a sexually transmitted infection.</p>



<p>Given the variety of head and neck cancers, it is key to talk with your care team about the exact type of cancer, stage and treatment options available. Having a firm grasp of your cancer diagnosis can also help you determine what to share with loved ones moving forward.</p>



<p>Consider when and how to talk to loved ones about your head and neck cancer</p>



<p>Before you begin disclosing your diagnosis, it can be helpful to first consider the different relationships in your life. It may be helpful to ask yourself the following questions:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><em>Who do you want to talk to?</em>&nbsp;For many people, this may be a partner, parent or close friend — anyone important to you who can provide emotional support throughout your cancer journey.</li>



<li><em>Who do you need to talk to?</em>&nbsp;From a practical or logistical standpoint, certain people in your life may need to be informed of a diagnosis sooner rather than later. For example, a&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/07/11/cancer-caregivers-3-rules-for-communicating-with-your-loved-ones-care-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">caregiver may need to speak to your care team on your behalf</a>&nbsp;or an employer may need to accommodate your treatment schedule.</li>



<li><em>Who can you talk to at a later time?&nbsp;</em>When you first receive a diagnosis, there are some people in your life who may not need to be informed immediately, for both personal and practical reasons. For example, you can speak with more-distant relatives and friends, neighbors and coworkers when you feel ready to talk.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you have a better understanding of who you’d like to speak to and when, it’s a good idea to think about the best method of communication. For a friend or family member, you may choose to make a personal phone call or set aside time to meet in person. If you’re&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/early-breast-cancer/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-a-cancer-diagnosis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talking with a child about a cancer diagnosis</a>, being as open and honest as possible about both the diagnosis and your feelings are good first steps. In other situations, a text message, letter, email or even social media post may feel more appropriate.</p>



<p>Each method comes with its own considerations — a personal conversation can feel affirming, but over time it may be exhausting to speak so intimately with everyone in your life. On the other hand, a social media post may require less time and emotional investment, but it may be a less personal or private option. To avoid emotional burnout or repeating yourself multiple times to multiple people, you also may choose to lean on the support of a loved one to inform extended family and friends. That way, they can inform your support network about your diagnosis, the best ways to support you and any specific requests you may have.</p>



<p>Most people know that it’s important to ask for help, but this is often easier said than done. To start, determine exactly what kind of help you need — be it logistical or emotional — and who exactly can provide it.</p>



<p>For example, if you can’t drive to your medical appointments or struggle with eating during treatment, consider asking a reliable friend to create a rideshare or meal prep schedule. By delegating this task, your loved ones have a tangible, consistent way to provide support and you can rest easier knowing certain tasks are taken care of.</p>



<p>Other times, you may need space to&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/mental-health/the-emotional-side-of-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talk about your feelings and concerns</a>. Think about the core message or emotion you’d like heard. Are you looking to vent? Do you want advice or reassurances? Before starting a conversation, stating the exact type of feedback and support that you’re looking for can ensure you get what you need.</p>



<p>“If you don’t have that kind of support network of family and friends, that doesn’t mean it’s nonexistent,” says Dr. Moore. “I encourage you to discuss your concerns during the initial consultation with your healthcare professional.” In many situations, there are a number of resources your care team can connect you with, including support groups, care coordinators and social work programs.</p>



<p>Finally, if you are experiencing sleep deprivation, feel overwhelmed or fatigued, or notice any difficulties with concentration and memory, Dr. Moore says these are early signs that you may need more support.</p>

<p>Curtis Jackson was living his dream life — a loving and supportive wife, three wonderful kids, and a future that looked as bright as could be.</p>



<p>Then, one day, without warning, the dream was shattered.</p>



<p>At only 46, Curtis was diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408">cholangiocarcinoma</a>, one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of cancer. It's a silent killer that strikes the liver. It is often diagnosed in later stages, leaving patients with few treatment options and little time to live.</p>



<p>The Jackson family turned to Mayo Clinic, where a team of experts fought the cancer with a weapon rarely used in the battle against this aggressive form of cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Years before his cancer diagnosis, Curtis was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)</a>. PSC is a chronic liver disease that causes inflammation and scarring to the bile ducts, which work with the liver to help with digestion.</p>



<p>PSC put the Arizona man at higher risk for liver cancer, requiring him to get regular diagnostic screenings. As with most forms of cancer, but particularly cholangiocarcinoma, doctors say early detection is key to improving patient outcomes.</p>



<p>However, with cholangiocarcinoma, there are often no warning signs or symptoms alerting patients of the need to consult with their doctor about getting screened, until it's too late. In Curtis' case, the cholangiocarcinoma was detected in one of his routine screenings at Mayo Clinic, which doctors say likely helped save his life.</p>

<p>"It's a very rare cancer that tends to grow unnoticed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bekaii-saab-tanios-s-m-d/bio-20413464">Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab</a>, an oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</a>. "If the cancer gets to the point where it's too advanced for surgery or transplantation, universally this is a noncurative or noncurable cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare weapon</strong></h2>



<p>Doctors say a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant </a>can sometimes be an option for some patients. However, not many transplant centers perform liver transplants on patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Mayo Clinic is one of the few centers that do offer liver transplantation for some patients who meet certain criteria.</p>



<p>In Curtis' case, doctors at Mayo Clinic determined a liver transplant was his best chance for survival.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We're not just here treating the cancer. We're also treating the disease that led to the cancer."</p><cite>Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It is a unique form of therapy that is based on research that started at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093">Dr. Bashar Aqel</a>, director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<p>"We developed some protocols that helped us improve the outcome of transplant in these patients, and without these protocols, a lot of patients with this type of cancer would not make it to transplant," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Mayo Clinic's ability to offer this curative option for rare cancers like this has differentiated us from many other transplant centers."</p><cite>Dr. Bashar Aqel, Director, Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Curtis first underwent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a> at Mayo Clinic. He was then placed on the liver transplant waiting list for a donor organ. While waiting, Curtis says he kept his focus on his family.</p>



<p>"I spent all the time I could with my wife and kids, like basketball practices, homework, anything we could do to help our kids," says Curtis.</p>



<p>When Curtis got the call a donor organ was found, he immediately reported to Mayo Clinic to undergo his lifesaving liver transplant. The surgery was a success. Four weeks later, Curtis was back at home with family recovering well and feeling a deep sense of gratitude for his organ donor and his team at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>"This truly is the gift of life," says Curtis.</p>

<p>For most athletes, the road to the Olympics is paved with years of training and sacrifice. As professional tennis player Gaby Dabrowski was preparing for her 2024 season and a chance to play in the Summer Olympics, her journey took an unexpected detour. A diagnosis of breast cancer threatened her dream and her life.</p>



<p>What followed was a carefully coordinated plan at Mayo Clinic, designed not only to treat the cancer but also to preserve her ability to compete on the world stage.</p>

<p>"I started playing tennis when I was 7 years old," Gaby says. "Growing up, the Olympics were always on TV for two weeks in the summer, so it was always my dream to compete at the Olympics."</p>



<p>Heading into the 2024 season, Gaby was ready to realize her childhood dream. But when she found a lump on her breast, Gaby's focus went immediately to her health.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maynard-jennifer-r-m-d/bio-20055247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jennifer Maynard</a>, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician specializing in sports medicine, helped coordinate Gaby's care.</p>



<p>"We recommended a pretty urgent evaluation, as she was over 30, we wanted to get the mammogram and the ultrasound," says Dr. Maynard.</p>



<p>Those results were abnormal. A <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-mri-for-dense-breasts-what-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast MRI</a> followed, then a biopsy confirmed the lump was cancer.</p>



<p>"When I was diagnosed, I didn't know if I would be able to play tennis again," Gaby says.</p>



<p>"She knew her ultimate goal was to be an Olympian at the Paris Olympics, so we had to be innovative and think outside the box," says Dr. Maynard.</p>



<p>Gaby's care team had to consider how to treat her cancer in a way that avoided the muscles used in playing tennis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-serving-ball-1024x576.jpg" alt="Gaby Dabrowski on the tennis court" class="wp-image-404084" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-serving-ball-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-serving-ball-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-serving-ball-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-serving-ball-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-serving-ball.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Gaby's care team developed a plan where treatment would not affect her tennis serve.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In the spring of 2024, she underwent surgery, then targeted radiation. Treatment was successful, and Gaby was cancer-free.</p>



<p>"Even though I wasn't playing on court and playing the game that I love, it was like swapping in the care team as my partners," Gaby says.</p>



<p>As soon as her care team cleared her, Gaby resumed training. Her dedication paid off in Paris. Gaby and her doubles partner earned an Olympic bronze medal, living out a dream.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-with-medal-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-404090" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-with-medal-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-with-medal-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-with-medal-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-with-medal-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Gaby-with-medal.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Gaby with her Olympic medal.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"When I was on the podium holding the medal, I really just felt full elation," Gaby says. "I didn't feel like it was just a win for me. I felt like it was a win for everyone: my best friends, my parents, my coaching team, my care team."</p>



<p>Gaby has continued to find success on the court in tournaments and off, as an advocate for personal health.</p>



<p>"I certainly have a newfound appreciation for playing a sport as my job, but at the same time, if you took it away from me right now, I'd be OK because I have my health, and that's the most important thing," Gaby says.</p>
