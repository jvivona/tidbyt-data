<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A genomic test co-developed by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://www.skylinedx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SkylineDx</a> can identify whether people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a> are at low or high risk for cancer in their <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353902%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymph nodes</a> — a finding that could guide treatment decisions and help some people avoid lymph node biopsy surgery. The study results are <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2840207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in JAMA Surgery.</p>



<p>In the largest prospective study of its kind, about 93% of people classified as low risk had no cancer in their lymph nodes, while about 25% in the high-risk group did. The multicenter clinical trial enrolled 1,761 people with early- or intermediate-stage melanoma at nine U.S. cancer centers between 2021 and 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decoding the tumor’s genomic blueprint</strong></h2>



<p>The test measures the activity of eight genes in a melanoma tumor and combines that data with a person's age and tumor thickness to estimate the chance that cancer has reached the lymph nodes. The Merlin CP-GEP Test analyzes tissue from the tumor already collected during an initial biopsy, so no additional procedure or visit is required for the test.</p>



<p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed under anesthesia to remove one or a few lymph nodes and check for microscopic cancer. The procedure usually requires a second incision and can have side effects, yet nearly 80% of people who undergo the surgery have no cancer in their lymph nodes.</p>



<p>"Surgery will always be central to cancer care, but this study shows that sentinel lymph node surgery might be avoided for selected patients with melanoma," says first author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, a surgical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/oncology/sections/overview/ovc-20198225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncologist</a> at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and co-principal investigator of the study. "This test lets us use a patient's own tumor biology to guide care with true precision."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning molecular insight into clinical impact</strong></h2>



<p>Melanoma is the deadliest form of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin cancer</a>. While early-stage disease can often be treated successfully, once melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, the risk of recurrence increases. Determining whether the cancer has reached the lymph nodes is a key step in guiding treatment.</p>



<p>"Melanoma progression is driven by subtle molecular processes that we're only beginning to understand," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/meves-alexander-m-d-m-b-a/bio-00027476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexander Meves, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dermatology/sections/overview/ovc-20420526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dermatologist</a> at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center who led earlier validation studies of the test. "This work translates that biology into tools that can improve care."</p>



<p>Researchers are now studying how incorporating the test into melanoma care might help healthcare professionals understand the risk of recurrence and guide follow-up care.</p>

<p>Patients with breast cancer now have more options when it comes to radiation treatments. The goal is to remove any remaining cancer cells following chemotherapy or surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In other situations, we use radiation if the cancer is more advanced, or spread to the lymph nodes," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Advancements in technology allow healthcare professionals to treat patients more safely. One technique called "prone positioning" reduces the chance of beams targeting other organs. For this procedure, patients lie on their stomachs.</p>



<p>"We take advantage of gravity, the breast pulls away from the body, and we can treat the breast without exposing the underlying lung and heart to unnecessary radiation," explains Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is cutting-edge. Unlike traditional radiation, this procedure delivers X-rays directly to the targeted area from multiple angles, allowing for higher, more effective doses.</p>



<p>"Before intensity-modulated radiation therapy, we were not able to conform the dose around the chest wall," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>For patients undergoing radiation therapy, it's crucial to stay hydrated and try to sleep well to fight fatigue. It's also important to use sunscreen after treatment.</p>

<p>Nuclear pores are entries to the nucleus made up of proteins called <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/genome-function-stability-nuclear-organization-cancer/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nucleoporins</a>. While nucleoporins usually stay at their post and help regulate the flow of molecules that can come in and out of the nucleus, researchers discovered that soluble POM121 — a subtype of the nucleoporin POM121 — uses its ability to navigate freely to help cancer cells grow and spread.</p>

<p></p>



<p><br>"Nobody had looked at the role of this soluble 'off-pore' nucleoporin because in gene expression analyses across databases, everything is classified under the primary nucleoporin. But through detailed analysis we saw an increase in sPOM121 in prostate cancer when compared to noncancerous tissue and a further increase in metastatic therapy resistant tumors," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.</p>

<p>"We started digging for its purpose and found it had a distinctly relevant role in driving prostate cancer progression to lethal stages of the disease," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo. The study combined patient tumor analyses, molecular profiling and preclinical models to identify the protein and test its role in metastatic prostate cancer.</p>



<p>The study builds on her&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30100187/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous research</a>, which identified POM121's key role in transporting cancer-promoting proteins into the nucleus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Logistic centers' that promote cancer</strong></h2>



<p>As a soluble protein, sPOM121 can roam freely in the nucleus, where DNA instructions are stored. "Because it's not attached to the structure that surrounds the nucleus, it can form condensates — which act like logistic centers — and bind to other proteins that regulate gene accessibility and activation," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.</p>



<p>Most notably, sPOM121 partners with a protein called SMARCA5 that modifies DNA packaging to allow a protein called beta-catenin to enhance its expression. Beta-catenin is known to drive therapy resistance and immunosuppressing genes.</p>



<p>Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo says this discovery offers a possible explanation for prostate cancer growth and spread when treated with standard therapy and poor response to immunotherapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A potential key to treatment-resistant prostate cancer</strong></h2>



<p>The study tested whether blocking sPOM121-driven cancer programs like beta-catenin could improve the effectiveness of treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which help the immune system attack cancer.</p>



<p>"We found that targeting the soluble POM121-beta-catenin pathway really enhances the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The tumors started getting a lot of T-cell infiltration and shrank," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo. "Beta-catenin inhibitors are currently being investigated in multiple tumor types, and our results provide the rationale to investigate the efficacy of these inhibitors alone or in combination with immunotherapy for prostate cancer."</p>



<p>Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo also pinpoints the strong unmet need to develop specific nucleoporin inhibitors that could target multiple cancer-driving signal pathways by disrupting these critical logistic centers. The disruption of these logistic centers by targeting sPOM121 would induce a blackout in the cancer cell, increasing the effectiveness of current therapies, but further investigation is needed to directly target sPOM121, says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Broader impact beyond prostate cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo says this study has observed the accumulation of POM121 in multiple tumor types. Her team now hopes to investigate whether the soluble form, sPOM121, is a common cancer driver or plays an earlier role in disease progression.</p>



<p>"If this is really controlling fundamental pathways fueling tumor progression, targeting sPOM121 might potentially benefit more patients in the future," she says.</p>



<p>She also hopes the study will encourage researchers to investigate how cancer might exploit other off-pore nucleoporins.</p>



<p>"We believe sPOM121 is one of many other nucleoporins that orchestrate key transcriptional hubs in the depth of the nucleus. Cancer likes to have a lot of tools on its belt, so we propose these off-pore nucleoporins are selected and used efficiently during tumor evolution," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I just had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammogram</a>, and I was told that I have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breast tissue.</a> What does that mean?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>About half of women are considered to have <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-research-improves-dense-breast-cancer-screening-and-early-detection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breasts,</a> based on the appearance of their breast tissue on a mammogram. The main concerns about dense breast tissue are that it makes&nbsp;breast cancer screening&nbsp;more complex and increases the risk of breast cancer. Here are some answers to questions you might have:<br></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is dense breast tissue?</strong></h2>



<p>Breast tissue is composed of milk glands, milk ducts and supportive tissue, which make up dense tissue. Breasts also include fatty tissue, which is nondense tissue. When viewed on a mammogram, women with dense breasts have more dense tissue than fatty tissue.</p>



<p>Nondense breast tissue typically appears dark and transparent on a mammogram. In contrast, dense breast tissue appears as a solid white area, which makes it difficult to see through.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How do doctors determine if you have dense breast tissue?</strong></h2>



<p>The radiologist who analyzes your mammogram determines the ratio of nondense to dense tissue and assigns a level of breast density. These levels are determined by results from the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System from the American College of Radiology.</p>



<p>The levels of density are designated by letters:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;Breasts are almost entirely composed of fat. About&nbsp;10%&nbsp;of women have this result.</li>



<li><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;Scattered areas of density, but most breast tissue is nondense. About&nbsp;40%&nbsp;of women have this result.</li>



<li><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;Heterogeneously dense indicates some areas of nondense tissue, but most breast tissue is dense. About&nbsp;40%&nbsp;of women have this result.</li>



<li><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;Extremely dense indicates that nearly all breast tissue is dense. About&nbsp;10%&nbsp;of women have this result.</li>
</ul>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="878" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Female-breast-density-1154793_3350944-002-2-1024x878.jpg" alt="Examples of each of the four breast density categories." class="wp-image-407031" style="width:579px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Female-breast-density-1154793_3350944-002-2-1024x878.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Female-breast-density-1154793_3350944-002-2-300x257.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Female-breast-density-1154793_3350944-002-2-768x659.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Female-breast-density-1154793_3350944-002-2.jpg 1312w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What causes dense breast tissue?</strong></h2>



<p>It's not clear why some women have a lot of dense breast tissue and others don't. Dense breasts are more likely if you:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Are younger.</strong>&nbsp;Your breast tissue tends to become less dense as you age, although some women may have dense breast tissue at any age.</li>



<li><strong>Have a lower body mass index.</strong>&nbsp;Women with less body fat are more likely to have more dense breast tissue compared with women who are obese.</li>



<li><strong>Take hormone therapy for menopause.</strong>&nbsp;Women who take combination hormone therapy to relieve signs and symptoms of menopause are more likely to have dense breasts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why does breast density matter?</strong></h2>



<p>Having dense breast tissue won't affect your daily life. However, it increases the chance that breast cancer may go undetected by a mammogram, since dense breast tissue can mask a potential cancer. It also increases your risk of breast cancer, though healthcare professionals aren't yet certain why.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do screening recommendations change for dense breasts?</strong></h2>



<p>Women with dense breasts but no other risk factors for breast cancer are considered to have a higher risk of breast cancer than average. Dense breast tissue makes it more challenging to interpret a mammogram, since cancer and dense breast tissue both appear white on a mammogram. This may increase the risk that cancer won't be detected on a mammogram.</p>



<p>However, mammograms are still effective screening tools. The most common type is a digital mammogram, which is more effective at detecting cancer. It saves images of your breasts as digital files, allowing for more detailed analysis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are other tests more effective?</strong></h2>



<p>Other tests carry both risks and benefits, although MRI and molecular breast imaging have demonstrated superior cancer detection in women with dense breasts.</p>



<p>Supplemental tests for breast cancer screening can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>3D mammogram, also known as breast tomosynthesis</strong><br>Tomosynthesis uses X-rays to collect multiple images of the breast from several angles. A computer synthesizes the images to form a 3D image of the breast. Many mammogram centers are transitioning to incorporate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/3d-technology-provides-enhanced-breast-cancer-detection">3D mammograms</a>&nbsp;as part of the standard mammogram technology.</li>



<li><strong>Breast MRI</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-mri/about/pac-20384809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI </a>uses magnets rather than radiation to create images of the breast. This option is recommended for women with a very high risk of breast cancer, such as those with genetic mutations.</li>



<li><strong>Molecular breast imaging</strong><br>This&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710">imaging</a>&nbsp;uses a gamma camera to record the activity of a radioactive tracer. The tracer is injected into a vein in your arm. Normal tissue and cancerous tissue react differently to the tracer, which can be seen in the images captured by the camera.</li>
</ul>



<p>Every test has pros and cons. Talk with your healthcare professional about your breast cancer risk factors. Together, you can decide whether additional screening tests are right for you.</p>

<p>Judge Audrey Moran is known for her strength and fairness in the courtroom in Florida's Duval county. But one of the most difficult cases she's faced is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a> that spread to the lining of her brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With the help of a dedicated <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/breast-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20459469">care team</a> and precise treatment, Judge Moran is back on the bench, and recent scans show something remarkable.  Alex Osiadacz (oh-SIGH-dus) has her story.</p>

<p>"I work as a county court judge."</p>



<p>Judge Moran doesn't shy away from a challenge, whether in her legal career, solving issues in her community or even her health.<br><br>"We were treating the metastatic breast cancer in my abdomen about two years ago now. I began noticing that my balance wasn't very good, and then I started limping," she says.</p>



<p>Scans in early 2024 showed the cancer had spread to the lining of her brain and spine. Treatment would pose another challenge after Judge Moran developed an infection where a port would deliver <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> into the lining of her brain.</p>



<p>"I said, 'We're going to have to figure something else out.' My wonderful oncologist, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/advani-pooja-p-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20464247" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Pooja Advani</a>, said she thought she had an idea because a new chemo had come out that she thought might be just the right thing for me," she says.</p>

<p>Instead of delivering treatment directly into the lining of her brain, Judge Moran's care team was able to deliver a newly approved therapy through her arm.&nbsp;The results were better than expected.</p>



<p>"The last scan I got of my brain, the results were that the brain cancer has resolved. And I got to tell you, I couldn't even believe it when I read it on my report," Judge Moran says.</p>



<p>"So many emotions but the biggest of gratitude, you know, to all the people that have worked as a part of her team," says Dr. Advani.</p>



<p>Follow-up appointments have confirmed that the treatment is still working for the metastasis in her abdomen.&nbsp;Beyond her diagnosis, Judge Moran remains active with her family and career.</p>



<p>She says, "You know, my life is back. I am at work. And I'm getting to do that work that I love."</p>

<p>In late September, Dr. Advani and Judge Moran had a chance to meet again.</p>



<p>"It almost brought me to tears to have seen how she was in 2024 when she was going through this <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20352479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">journey </a>and the remarkable clinical progress that she has made," Dr. Advani says.</p>



<p>Judge Moran adds, "I'd gotten to the point where I almost didn't want to try anything anymore, and she really helped me realize this wasn't the time to give up. It was time to keep going. And boy, I'm glad I did. I'm really, really glad I did."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I understand surgery is often included as part of the treatment plan for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>. If I'm a candidate for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> but am also considering a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a>, what are some things I should keep in mind? Should my breast density be a factor in my decision-making?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> Women diagnosed with breast cancer are almost immediately confronted with treatment decisions. If your&nbsp;surgical oncologist&nbsp;gave you a choice between a lumpectomy and a mastectomy to remove a tumor, that's often because either option will lead to a similar long-term health outcome.</p>



<p>A lumpectomy is commonly known as breast conservation surgery because it keeps most of the breast intact, whereas a mastectomy removes the entire breast.&nbsp;Regardless of which procedure you choose, the risk of breast cancer recurrence is roughly the same.</p>



<p>Lumpectomy is a treatment option for early-stage breast cancer.&nbsp;Compared with a mastectomy, it's less invasive and tends to have a quicker recovery. It also can help preserve the cosmetic appearance and sensation of the breast. Your healthcare professional will recommend radiation therapy after a lumpectomy to reduce the risk of breast cancer returning in the breast.</p>



<p>A mastectomy removes the whole breast. In many cases, radiation therapy is not needed after mastectomy. Individuals&nbsp;with a genetic predisposition for breast cancer, such as the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation, may opt for a mastectomy as a preventive measure following their diagnosis.</p>



<p>After a mastectomy, some women choose to forgo <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/breast-reconstruction-implants/about/pac-20384934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reconstructive surgery</a>, opting for what is called an aesthetic flat closure.&nbsp;There can be many reasons for this, including wanting to limit future surgeries, reducing risks and complications, and desiring a faster return to daily life and activities.</p>



<p>For other patients, having a breast mound is part of how they identify as women.&nbsp;Multiple types of breast reconstruction procedures are available following either a lumpectomy or mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery can occur at the same time as breast cancer surgery, or you can plan your reconstruction weeks, months or years after treatment.</p>



<p>The surgical technique and cosmetic outcomes after mastectomy and reconstruction have improved over the past 20 years. More women can keep their nipple and areolar complex and, in many cases, a procedure can be performed to help improve sensation to the nipple and areolar complex.<br><br>Breast density also could be a factor in your decision-making. About half of people who have screening <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/about/pac-20384806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mammograms</a> have <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mammogram/in-depth/dense-breast-tissue/art-20123968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dense breasts</a>. Dense breast tissue is harder to see through on a mammogram image. Having dense breast tissue should not affect one's decision to undergo a mastectomy or lumpectomy.</p>



<p>However, dense breast tissue may influence the need for additional tests before surgery, such as an MRI. An MRI looks for abnormal blood flow within the breast and can "see through" dense tissue. This may help surgeons better determine the extent of disease and guide them in the removal.</p>



<p>Ultimately, determining the option that is best for you is a nuanced decision that can be based on a variety of factors, including cancer-based reasons, family history and genetics, and peace of mind. Choosing which surgical route to take is deeply personal, and there is no one "best choice" for every woman. After careful consideration and&nbsp;consultation with your healthcare team, you should make the decision that you determine is best for you, based on the specifics of your cancer and your individual needs and preferences. <strong>— </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mclaughlin-sarah-a-m-d/bio-20055048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Sarah McLaughlin, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Surgical Oncology, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></strong></p>

The investigational medicine is a targeted <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiopharmaceutic/about/pac-20587480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiopharmaceutical</a> theranostic (RPT) that is designed to target a novel protein called glypican-3 (GPC3). The RPT was administered to the patient as part of a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/clinical-trials/cls-20583570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first-in-human clinical trial</a> for the targeted therapy. This investigational RPT includes both a diagnostic imaging agent, intended to identify the cancer cells, and a therapeutic agent, intended to target and kill cancer cells.</p>



<p>GPC3 was identified as a potentially viable and promising target because it is produced at higher levels in HCC tissue than in a normal, healthy adult liver. It is also considered an oncofetal cell surface protein because GPC3 is normally only active during fetal development. In adults, the protein is turned off, but when cancer forms, it "reawakens" the protein to support rapid growth and evade the immune system. This means that GPC3 is found only on cancer cells, which makes it a strong potential target for treatment. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With this knowledge, Mayo Clinic researchers are participating in a first-in-human clinical trial investigating alpha-emitting RPTs, which use alpha particle radiation to precisely and powerfully diagnose, target, and potentially kill cancer cells. In this trial, the RPT includes an agent that binds to GPC3.</p>



<p>The phase 1/1b study is being conducted at all three academic Mayo Clinic sites in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester</a>; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona/campus-buildings-maps/mayo-clinic-hospital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix</a>; and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. The first person to receive the clinical trial procedure was at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>"Whole-body GPC3 targeted molecular imaging shows high localization to the tumor and minimal accumulation in normal tissues, indicating that the therapeutic radiation effects will be limited to sites of disease," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parent-ephraim-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20445440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ephraim Parent, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a radiologist and division chair of Nuclear Medicine at Mayo Clinic in Florida. Dr. Parent is co-principal investigator on the trial.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic in Florida researchers recently <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-treats-first-person-in-the-us-with-a-novel-radiopharmaceutical-therapy-for-breast-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were the first in the U.S. to apply</a> an investigational alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy in a treatment setting to a patient living with metastatic breast cancer. Mayo Clinic has now marked another remarkable first by delivering a different novel alpha-emitting investigational therapy to a patient with liver cancer, the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, we are committed to advancing innovative therapies that expand possibilities for those facing this devastating disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kankeu-fonkoua-lionel-a-m-d/bio-20512666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lionel Kankeu Fonkoua, M.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and principal investigator of the trial. "Being able to offer access to this novel radiopharmaceutical approach reflects our dedication to pushing the boundaries of liver cancer care."</p>



<p>The drug for the study is being developed by RayzeBio Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb Company, the sponsor of the active phase 1/1b clinical trial.</p>

<p>"The first thing to know if you get notified is that dense breast tissue is completely normal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Half of all women will have dense tissue," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>He says dense breasts are identified through a mammogram. Additional testing is the next step.</p>



<p>"The most widely available supplemental screening test for women with dense tissues is probably an ultrasound of the breast or an MRI," says Dr. Sharpe. "There have been lots of studies showing that MRI is the most sensitive test for finding breast cancer."</p>



<p>An MRI is meant to be used along with a mammogram, not instead.</p>



<p>"MRI is the most sensitive test we have for finding breast cancer. It can see through density. It can find hard-to-see, small cancers," says Dr. Sharpe.</p>



<p>But it's not for everyone. You'll lie face down on a table and then guided into the MRI machine."Some patients that have challenges with claustrophobia might struggle to be comfortable in the smaller space&nbsp;of the MRI scanner," explains Dr. Sharpe.</p>

<p>The benefit is clear, he says.</p>



<p>"Women with dense tissue or high risk for breast cancer that undergo breast MRI, we are able to see cancers that would be hiding from the mammogram."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supplemental screening options</h2>



<p>Other supplemental screening options include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/molecular-breast-imaging/about/pac-20394710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">molecular breast imaging (MBI)</a>, ultrasound and contrast-enhanced mammography.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Sharpe says choosing what screening method works for you is an individual decision that should be made with your healthcare team, but he says it's important to start with your annual screening.</p>



<p>"The most important thing for women to know is that you should get your annual mammogram, starting at age 40. Also, if you have dense tissue, consider a supplemental screening, another imaging test looking at the breast tissues in a different way — and you should get that exam regularly as well," he says.</p>

<p>Breast cancer receives much attention during October's awareness month. Although sightings of pink ribbons and breast cancer-related information increase during the month, it's crucial to keep screenings and clinical breast exams at the forefront of preventive care year-round.</p>



<p>A Mayo Clinic Health System high-risk breast consultant and breast cancer awareness advocate shares the top&nbsp;10 questions about breast cancer asked by people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Why do I need to worry about breast cancer and having routine mammograms?</strong><br>This is the most common question shared during breast clinic consultations. Many people mention that they don't have any family history of breast cancer. However, approximately just 20% of breast cancer is related to family history and genetic links. People are considered at the highest risk after a breast cancer diagnosis in a first-degree relative, such as a mom or sister.</li>



<li><strong>What can I do to prevent breast cancer from developing?</strong><br>For most people, the answer is to live a healthy lifestyle, including not smoking, minimizing alcohol consumption and maintaining an ideal body weight through diet and exercise. The majority of the risk for breast cancer comes from being female, having breasts and aging.</li>



<li><strong>What steps can I take to be informed of my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>This answer has two parts. The first part is to learn about your family's medical history. The second part is to follow your healthcare team's recommended preventive screening plan, including a mammogram if necessary.</li>



<li><strong>Should I continue doing self-checks of my breasts and have an annual clinical breast exam?</strong><br>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Preventive Services Taskforce update breast screening recommendations annually, but more research studies need to be done. Your health history and conversations with your healthcare team will help inform the best approach for you. Although not all healthcare professionals perform a yearly clinical breast exam as part of an annual physical, you may choose to perform monthly or quarterly self-checks to increase your breast awareness. Both a yearly breast exam by a medical professional and regular self-checks are recommended if you have a higher risk of breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>What does it mean to have dense breasts, and how does that affect mammograms?</strong><br>Approximately 30% of people have moderately dense breasts and up to 10% have extremely dense breasts. While dense breast tissue does affect the detection of breast cancer through mammography, a mammogram is still a recommended annual screening starting at age 40 for people with average breast cancer risk.</li>



<li><strong>Does taking a birth control pill increase my risk of developing breast cancer?<br></strong>No strong connection has been identified to suggest any such connection in average-risk patients during childbearing years. However, studies suggest that continuing hormone therapy after age 60 can increase the risk of breast and endometrial cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Does pregnancy and breastfeeding increase my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>No, it's quite the opposite. The risk of developing breast cancer decreases based on the duration of time spent pregnant and breastfeeding.</li>



<li><strong>How do environmental toxin exposure and radiation affect breast cancer?<br></strong>Certain factors, such as radiation exposure from previous cancer treatment, working in an environment with toxins, or other radiation exposure can increase your risk of many cancer types, including breast cancer.</li>



<li><strong>Should I have genetic testing to determine if I have a family-related risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>The short answer is, for some people, yes. However, genetic testing is recommended only after a discussion with your healthcare team or breast specialist about your cancer risks. You may be asked to meet with a genetics counselor to ensure that there is a strong indication for testing.</li>



<li><strong>Does my age affect my risk of breast cancer?</strong><br>Yes. Age is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. As people get older, genetic changes and lifetime hormone exposure can increase risk. Aging is one of several risk factors you cannot change, along with family history and breast density. Because risk rises over time, it’s important to follow screening recommendations and maintain healthy habits such as staying active and limiting alcohol.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you have been identified as having a higher risk of breast cancer and referred to a high-risk breast clinic, you can expect a comprehensive meeting with a healthcare professional who is skilled and passionate about breast cancer prevention and survivorship.</p>

But we've learned that in areas of dense breast tissue, breast cancers can hide from detection on a mammogram until they reach an advanced size. Our research focuses on detecting the most lethal cancers, which can include invasive tumors that grow quickly. If these are detected earlier, we likely can save more lives," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hruska-carrie-b-ph-d/bio-00027852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Hruska, Ph.D.</a>, a professor of medical physics and the lead author of a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.243953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Radiology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She and her research team studied 2,978 women with dense breasts between 40-75 years&nbsp;old at five separate centers. The study participants received two annual breast cancer screenings that included the combination of a supplemental MBI test and a 3D mammogram, also called digital breast tomosynthesis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Breast radiologists detected more cancerous tissue from the combined MBI and mammography screenings compared to either technique alone.</p>



<p>"MBI is a fairly simple, low cost and safe option for women who have dense breasts and are seeking a supplemental screening test," says Dr. Hruska. <br><br>MBI combined with a mammogram is available at about 30 sites in the U.S., including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/eau-claire" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin</a>; and Mayo Clinic campuses in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rochester</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoenix</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacksonville, Florida</a>.<br></p>

<p>With more screening, there is a risk of being called back for additional testing to evaluate the findings. The researchers were pleased to find that although the addition of MBI to mammography led to 279 more women being called back in the first year of screening, this rate of callbacks decreased by half in the second round of screening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps to improve breast cancer screening</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Hruska's team is working on developing an algorithm that would cut the time it takes from 40 minutes to about 20 minutes or less to capture an image using this technique. This would make it more comfortable for women and enable more women to schedule this screening.</p>
