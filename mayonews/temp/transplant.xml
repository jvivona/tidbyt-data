<p>That innovation came at a critical moment for 74-year-old Joe Harris. His daughter-in-law, Brooke, made the extraordinary decision to donate her kidney, and together with this new surgical approach, it gave Joe not just better health, but a renewed future.</p>

<p>"You're a match." <br><br>The words Brooke Harris was waiting for. Now, to share the news with her father-in-law.</p>



<p>Joe Harris had been on a kidney transplant waiting list since 2016. Worried about his age and ability to care for his wife, he was eager to find a match.</p>



<p>"I just was afraid that things were going to run out and I would get to a point that I could only be on dialysis, and then I wouldn't be, wouldn't be able to take care of her," says Joe.</p>



<p>Multiple setbacks in finding a kidney donor deeply affected Brooke.</p>

<p>"As soon as we found out and they told us that that second person didn't work, it was just this deep knowing in me that I need to test and find out. I didn't know why," she says.</p>



<p>And that test was a match.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/nguyen-michelle-c-m-d/bio-20520642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michelle Nguyen</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains how direct donation works.</p>



<p>"If you have a friend or a loved one who wants to donate a kidney to you, and you match them by blood type and by tissue typing, you can donate your kidney directly to your friend or your loved one," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Not only would Joe get the organ he had been hoping for, but he'd also be the first patient at Mayo Clinic in Arizona to undergo&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robotic kidney transplantation</a>.</p>



<p>"I went, 'Good, let's do it.' I had no hesitancy about the robotic thing. The more I learned about it, the more I thought this is going to be kind of cool," Joe says.</p>



<p>"In patients who meet criteria to receive robotic kidney transplant, the goal is that it will provide improved outcomes for the patient — so smaller incisions, less pain, faster recovery, faster return to work or faster return to their day-to-day life," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Robotic kidney surgery doesn't replace the surgeon. Instead, it gives surgeons advanced tools to operate, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/katariya-nitin-n-m-d/bio-20517065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nitin Katariya</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains.</p>

<p>"It is a console that has four arms that can be placed near the bed and then a separate sort of console where you sit apart from the patient, where you can control the arms. And these arms articulate in ways you can control the camera, and you have multiple different instruments that you can switch out to navigate the anatomy and perform your operation," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Nguyen adds, "One important thing to note about robotic surgery, using this platform, is that at no point in time is the robot making any movements without the surgeons maneuvering the instruments."</p>



<p>For Brooke, she says the experience was easier than she thought.</p>



<p>"Honestly, even going back to the surgery, I have to say it's definitely not as scary as it seems. And recovery was a lot easier than I had anticipated," says Brooke.</p>



<p>And for Joe, his gratitude for his daughter-in-law's selfless donation is hard to put into words.</p>



<p>"How do you thank somebody for that? I don't know. It's so humbling. That's been hard for me, in a way, but I'm grateful. And she knows how I care about her," says Joe.</p>

<p>When Charnel Golis-Tabag picked up her sister from the airport in her home state of Hawaii, she didn't expect to hear that her sister's kidney function had dropped below 11%. That moment changed everything. "She told me she was on the transplant list," Charnel recalls. "Two days later, I called Mayo Clinic to start the living kidney donation process."</p>



<p>Charnel had seen too many family members endure the exhausting cycle of dialysis — three times a week, hours at a time. "They were tired, their veins were shot, they couldn't carry their grandchildren," she says. "I didn't want that for my sister."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The power of living donation</strong></h2>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/about/pac-20569323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donor kidneys</a> are great options for people waiting for a transplant," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jadlowiec-carrie-c-m-d/bio-20358001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Carrie Jadlowiec</a>, surgical director of Kidney Transplant at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. "They have a shorter waiting period, fewer complications, and the kidneys function longer than deceased donor kidneys."</p>



<p>For Charnel, knowing that her sister could live a longer, healthier life with a living kidney solidified her decision to donate. Despite her family's concerns for her own health, she was committed. "I believe we need to start with educating young Native Hawaiian people about living a healthier lifestyle," she says. "In our ohana community, we can reclaim our health," she says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A donor chain of hope</strong></h2>



<p>For Michelle Gabriel, her younger sister's diagnosis was a turning point. "We asked each other, 'Can we do this? Will I be a match? What will it cost?' There were lots of questions and no answers at first," Michelle says.</p>



<p>She turned to Mayo Clinic, the National Kidney Foundation and the National Donate Life Registry. "These resources are fantastic and easily available online. Beyond online, our transplant coordinators walk patients through every step of the process," explains&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ty Diwan</a>, transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "We connect with patients from anywhere in the world via the portal and virtual appointments."</p>

<p>Michelle wasn't a match to her sister, but that didn't stop her. She joined a paired exchange program, creating a donor chain that benefited multiple families. No longer a question but a statement, "We can do this," became the sisters' ongoing mantra. "From that moment, we were all in. I saw the bigger picture: three people received kidneys that day," says Michelle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A husband's promise</strong></h2>



<p>For Albert Harris, June 20, 2024, is a date he'll never forget — it's the day he donated his kidney to his wife, making her "officially his other half," he jokes. "When she got sick, we got sick. I understood the marital vows, in sickness and in health. She's my partner in everything, and I look forward to having her around for a very long time."</p>

<p>Though friends and family worried about his health, Mayo Clinic's transplant team provided the reassurance he needed. He learned he could return to his normal life within weeks and give his wife the chance at a healthier, longer life.</p>

<p>Nearly 60% of people on&nbsp;<a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant waiting lists</a>&nbsp;come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color. This gap makes awareness and education critical — especially during Minority Living Donor Awareness Month, which highlights the need for diverse donors to help reduce disparities in transplant access.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a>&nbsp;and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463">Dr. </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463"> Mao</a>, transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "It is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A shared legacy of hope</strong></h2>



<p>For Albert, Charnel and Michelle, living kidney donation was about more than surgery; it was about love, family and community. "It wasn't just a gift to my sister," Charnel says. "It was a gift to our entire family."</p>



<p>"You become someone's miracle," Michelle adds. "That person is someone's parent, sibling, friend. You give hope to everyone who loves them."</p>



<p>In most states,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a>&nbsp;to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card.

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Comprehensive care at Mayo Clinic</strong></h2>



<p>Living kidney donation is a&nbsp;safe, medically supported procedure, with most donors resuming their lives within weeks.

<p><em>August is National Minority Donor Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Organ donation is a powerful act of generosity and compassion. It is one that can save lives, restore health and offer hope to those facing critical illness. While donation rates vary across different communities, there is a meaningful opportunity in underrepresented communities where donation rates remain disproportionately low. This presents an opportunity for people to help raise awareness and inspire others to consider this vital choice.</p>



<p>More than 106,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)</a>. Many come from diverse backgrounds, yet donor representation from these communities remains low. By learning about organ donation and choosing to register, whether as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living</a> or deceased donor, individuals can help strengthen awareness and directly support the health and well-being of their communities.</p>



<p>"Increasing diversity among organ donors is essential to improving equity in transplantation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/budhiraja-pooja-m-b-b-s/bio-20486288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pooja Budhiraja, M.B.B.S.</a>, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist. "Minority communities often face a higher risk of organ failure and longer wait times, yet they remain underrepresented among donors. Greater donor diversity can improve compatibility, shorten wait times and lead to better outcomes."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic experts share five reasons why expanding organ donor participation across all communities can make a life-saving difference.</p>



<p><strong>1. One donor can save up to eight lives.</strong><br>A single organ donor can save up to eight lives by donating organs such as kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas and intestines. In addition, donors can improve many more lives through tissue and eye donation, helping others regain mobility, sight, and healing after trauma or illness.</p>



<p><strong>2. Living donation is a safe and viable option.</strong><br>Living donation, such as donating one kidney or a portion of the liver, is a life-changing gift and a faster route to transplant for many. Kidney donation is the most common type of living-donor transplant. A healthy person can donate one of their two kidneys and continue living a full, active <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/about/pac-20569323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life</a>.</p>



<p>"Living donors undergo comprehensive health screens to ensure that donation is safe and will not negatively impact their long-term health," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen Mao, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. "Following donation, our living-donor heroes have gone on to bear children, climb mountains and complete marathons."</p>



<p><strong>3. Age isn't a barrier to organ donation.</strong><br>There is no upper age limit for organ, eye or tissue donation. While you must be at least 18 to register in most states, eligibility is based on medical condition at the time of donation, not age alone. Older adults — including those in their 70s or beyond — have successfully donated organs and tissues.</p>



<p><strong>4. Underrepresented populations are more likely to need a transplant.</strong><br>Conditions that can lead to organ failure — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease — are more common in African American, Latino, Asian American and Native American communities. According to the <a href="https://www.kidney.org/take-action/advocate/legislative-priorities/health-disparities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Foundation</a>, kidney disease disproportionately affects underrepresented communities.</p>



<p>"Patients in minority groups face many challenges in accessing transplantation, either for donation or as a potential transplant recipient," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ty Diwan, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. "Bringing awareness of the prospect of donation to specific groups will not only help save lives overall, but continue to foster conversations on how to improve access for patients in these specific populations."</p>



<p><strong>5. A better match can lead to better outcomes.</strong><br>Organs aren't matched by race or ethnicity, but blood types and tissue markers tend to be more compatible among people with shared ancestry. That means recipients may have better outcomes when the donor comes from a similar background.</p>



<p>"Registering as a donor is a simple, powerful act that can change — and even save — multiple lives. I encourage everyone to learn about donation, talk with their families, and take that step to offer hope and healing," says Dr. Budhiraja.</p>



<p>To register as an organ donor, visit <a href="https://www.donatelife.net/nmdam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donate Life America</a>.</p>

<p>In the U.S., about <a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/fast-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17 people</a> die every day while waiting for an organ transplant.</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a> and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says Dr. Mao. "So it is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more organ failures.</p>



<p>"The more people we can help the sooner through transplant, the better," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living donors do not experience a change in their quality of life after surgery, but a recipient's life can change for the better almost immediately.</p>



<p>"If somebody is approved to be a <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donor</a>, we expect they will live a full and normal life following their donation process," says Dr. Mao.</p>

<p>After more than 22 months at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Children's</a>, 13-year-old Ava Weitl went home to Iowa. She and her family were met with tears and cheers as dozens of members from her care team, who are now considered friends of the family, said goodbye and wished her well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was a day Ava had been looking forward to after a long journey with heart failure, two lifesaving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ecmo/about/pac-20484615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</a> therapies, a heart transplant, kidney failure and a kidney transplant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Born with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)</a>, a life-threatening condition where the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped, Ava faced three open-heart surgeries before she would reach her 5th birthday. Within 90 minutes of her birth, her first surgery was performed. Her second surgery was completed months later, but the third, typically required for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-qa-podcast-hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLHS</a> patients between the ages of 3 and 4, was not possible due to other medical concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For a handful of years, Ava's care team monitored her to see what her body would do. During that time, Ava felt good and was "defying the odds," as her mom, Christina DeShaw, would say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was in 2021, during third grade, when Ava began to show signs of her heart and lungs struggling. While cardiac catheterization improved the blood flow to her lungs, it was a temporary improvement, and by early 2023, doctors determined a heart transplant was her only option.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Officially listed for a heart transplant in February 2023, Ava's condition worsened, leading to hospitalization at Mayo Clinic in September 2023. That hospital stay was the start of her long journey of constant monitoring and tests, and it wasn’t easy on her family as they navigated life split between Minnesota and Iowa.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ava's condition took a critical turn. Ava was placed on life-sustaining ECMO, which provides heart and lung support when those organs are failing. Then, Feb. 26, 2024, the call came: a donor heart became available. The surgery was successful, but postoperative challenges arose.</p>



<p>Weeks later, complications with her lungs led to a return to ECMO for three months. She also needed a tracheostomy placed. While trying to save her lungs, her kidney function began to fail, leading to another gift of life — a kidney transplant on Jan. 25, 2025, thanks to a donation from her uncle through a kidney exchange with the National Kidney Registry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"She's a walking miracle," her mother says. "We can't even wrap our heads around what she's been through."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — While immunosuppressive medications are critical to prevent rejection of transplant organs, they also come with plenty of downsides. They can cause harsh side effects, like headaches and tremors, and increase the risk for infection and cancer. But what if there was a way to prevent organ rejection without using these medications?</p>



<p>That goal fuels the work of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stegall-mark-d-m-d/bio-00027542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Stegall, M.D.</a>, a longtime Mayo Clinic transplant researcher. He leads a team of researchers developing pioneering therapies to prevent organ rejection without the need for immunosuppression. A recently published study in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amjtransplant.org/article/S1600-6135(25)00073-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Journal of Transplantation</a>&nbsp;is offering hope for patients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using stem cells to prevent organ rejection</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic participated in the multisite phase 3 clinical trial detailed in the study. The goal was to see whether people who simultaneously received both a kidney and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/bone-marrow-transplant/home/orc-20212005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stem cell transplant</a>&nbsp;from a closely matched sibling could discontinue all immunosuppressive medications after a year. The results were promising. The study found that 75% of participants were able to stop taking the medication for more than two years. At Mayo Clinic, three patients participated, with two off immunosuppression medications for over three years and one on a low dose.</p>



<p>"I've been involved in transplant research for more than 30 years, and we've done quite a few amazing things. But in the scheme of things, this research is right at the very top. It's been a goal — to be able to safely get transplant recipients off immunosuppression — for longer than I've been doing this. We're very excited about it," says Dr. Stegall, a co-author of the study.</p>



<p>The research being done across Mayo Clinic is part of a growing trend in transplant to explore ways to use cellular therapies to prevent organ rejection. It is also a cornerstone of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/transforming-transplant-initiative-aspires-to-save-lives-through-bioengineering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Transforming Transplant Initiative</a>, which has the bold goal of ensuring everyone who wants a transplant can get one and to make transplants more successful.</p>



<p>To qualify for the clinical trial, the transplant recipients and donors needed to be siblings whose tissue types closely matched. The donor agreed to donate their stem cells in addition to their kidney to their sibling. The recipient receives the transplant, undergoes radiation and then receives the stem cell transplant. The goal was to wean recipients off immunosuppression medication after a year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Almost like the transplant didn't happen'</strong></h2>



<p>For Minnesota native Mark Welter, the results have been better than he imagined. Four years ago, he needed a kidney transplant due to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic kidney disease</a>, an inherited condition that causes cysts to grow on the kidneys. The Mayo Clinic patient volunteered to be a part of the clinical trial in hopes of not having to worry about immunosuppression medication the rest of his life. His younger sister Cindy Kendall immediately stepped forward to donate a kidney and her stem cells to help her brother.</p>



<p>"Being able to see him get off those medications has been amazing," Cindy says. "He just gets to live his life to the fullest. He has been able to see both of his daughters get married and meet his grandchildren."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Mark has not taken immunosuppression medication for more than three years.</p>



<p>"I feel fantastic. I actually feel like I did before the transplant, which has been the greatest thing," Mark says. "It's almost like the transplant didn't happen."</p>



<p>There is still plenty of work to be done to advance this research. This clinical trial only involved siblings with closely matching tissue types. Researchers want to know if stem cell transplants can prevent rejection in recipients paired with a less closely matched donor.</p>



<p>"Even in closely matched siblings, immunosuppression is needed lifelong. We have seen stopping medications even at eight to 10 years post-transplant leads to rejection. Our goal is to find ways to reduce or stop immunosuppressive medications after transplant so patients can have longer lasting kidneys with fewer side effects," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bentall-andrew-j-m-b-ch-b-m-d/bio-20340753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Bentall, M.B., Ch.B., M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist.</p>

<p>Curtis Jackson was living his dream life — a loving and supportive wife, three wonderful kids, and a future that looked as bright as could be.</p>



<p>Then, one day, without warning, the dream was shattered.</p>



<p>At only 46, Curtis was diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408">cholangiocarcinoma</a>, one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of cancer. It's a silent killer that strikes the liver. It is often diagnosed in later stages, leaving patients with few treatment options and little time to live.</p>



<p>The Jackson family turned to Mayo Clinic, where a team of experts fought the cancer with a weapon rarely used in the battle against this aggressive form of cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Years before his cancer diagnosis, Curtis was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)</a>. PSC is a chronic liver disease that causes inflammation and scarring to the bile ducts, which work with the liver to help with digestion.</p>



<p>PSC put the Arizona man at higher risk for liver cancer, requiring him to get regular diagnostic screenings. As with most forms of cancer, but particularly cholangiocarcinoma, doctors say early detection is key to improving patient outcomes.</p>



<p>However, with cholangiocarcinoma, there are often no warning signs or symptoms alerting patients of the need to consult with their doctor about getting screened, until it's too late. In Curtis' case, the cholangiocarcinoma was detected in one of his routine screenings at Mayo Clinic, which doctors say likely helped save his life.</p>

<p>"It's a very rare cancer that tends to grow unnoticed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bekaii-saab-tanios-s-m-d/bio-20413464">Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab</a>, an oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</a>. "If the cancer gets to the point where it's too advanced for surgery or transplantation, universally this is a noncurative or noncurable cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare weapon</strong></h2>



<p>Doctors say a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant </a>can sometimes be an option for some patients. However, not many transplant centers perform liver transplants on patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Mayo Clinic is one of the few centers that do offer liver transplantation for some patients who meet certain criteria.</p>



<p>In Curtis' case, doctors at Mayo Clinic determined a liver transplant was his best chance for survival.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We're not just here treating the cancer. We're also treating the disease that led to the cancer."</p><cite>Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It is a unique form of therapy that is based on research that started at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093">Dr. Bashar Aqel</a>, director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<p>"We developed some protocols that helped us improve the outcome of transplant in these patients, and without these protocols, a lot of patients with this type of cancer would not make it to transplant," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Mayo Clinic's ability to offer this curative option for rare cancers like this has differentiated us from many other transplant centers."</p><cite>Dr. Bashar Aqel, Director, Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Curtis first underwent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a> at Mayo Clinic. He was then placed on the liver transplant waiting list for a donor organ. While waiting, Curtis says he kept his focus on his family.</p>



<p>"I spent all the time I could with my wife and kids, like basketball practices, homework, anything we could do to help our kids," says Curtis.</p>



<p>When Curtis got the call a donor organ was found, he immediately reported to Mayo Clinic to undergo his lifesaving liver transplant. The surgery was a success. Four weeks later, Curtis was back at home with family recovering well and feeling a deep sense of gratitude for his organ donor and his team at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>"Thank you because now I get to see my daughters get married, go to college, I get to see my son live his dreams and go to college and get married," says Curtis. "I get to live and grow old with my wife. I can't say this enough to everyone, 'thank you.'"</p>

<p>"We're already observing excellent function from Curtis' new liver, with the majority of his liver tests returning normal results," says Dr. Aqel. "His recovery has been remarkably swift and impressive."</p>



<p>"A lot of love goes out to the people in that family," says Gwyn Jackson, Curtis' oldest daughter in reference to the organ donor's family. "They allowed us to have our dad back and we're so grateful because we love him so much."</p>



<p>Doctors at Mayo Clinic are monitoring Curtis' progress closely. Meanwhile, Curtis' future is back to looking bright, only now with even deeper gratitude in his heart.</p>



<p>"This truly is the gift of life," says Curtis.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size"><strong>Craig Scherer takes a deep breath and a bold step into his second chance at life</strong></h3>



<p>Lung disease is a condition that affects millions of people worldwide. Some of those diseases, like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, are among the top leading causes of death globally.</p>



<p>COPD alone affects over 16 million people, like Arizona resident Craig Scherer. Craig got treatments to manage his condition, but there's no cure. The disease is progressive, meaning it gets worse over time, making it harder and harder for a person to breathe.</p>



<p>Craig's disease progressed until treatments no longer worked, leaving him gasping for air and facing death. Doctors said his only hope for survival was a lung transplant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Craig turned to Mayo Clinic in Phoenix, where doctors just launched a new multidisciplinary, specialized lung transplant program. Craig became the new program's first patient, and today he is breathing easy.</p>

<p>It was love at first sight for Craig and Nanci Scherer.</p>



<p>They met at a little league game in the spring of 1992. Eight months later, they were married. This year, Craig and Nanci celebrated their 32nd anniversary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their smiles today are just as radiant as on their wedding day.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Happiness turns to heartache</strong></h2>



<p>The couple raised four children. Their family grew to include 14 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. They planned for retirement and looked forward to the day when they could travel and enjoy their future together.</p>



<p>But when Craig turned 60, life took a sharp turn. He was diagnosed with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>.&nbsp;COPD is a progressive disease that causes damage to the lungs, making it hard to breathe. Treatments can help manage the disease, but there's no cure. As the disease continues its silent assault, quality of life often slowly slips away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I couldn't do things, and even if I could do things, I didn't have the strength to do it or the stamina because my lungs would wear out," says Craig.</p>



<p>Craig's COPD continued to get worse. Eventually he couldn't breathe, walk or even talk. "It was silent at our house. We didn't talk because he couldn't talk. He didn't have the oxygen," says Nanci. "We lived in silence and isolation."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Last hope for survival</strong></h2>



<p>Eventually, Craig reached end-stage lung disease. Treatments no longer worked and his health continued to decline. Craig was left with only one last hope for survival, a lung transplant. Craig and Nanci turned to Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</p>



<p>"We see this with patients, when there are no other options, no medical interventions you can do at that point," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/d-cunha-jonathan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20471123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jonathan&nbsp;D'Cunha</a>, surgical director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/lung-transplant/home/orc-20211835?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=yext&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=departmenttransplant&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=transplant&amp;cauid=105143&amp;y_source=1_MTA3ODAzNDQwMC03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24ud2Vic2l0ZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo&nbsp;Clinic&nbsp;Lung Transplant Program </a>in Arizona&nbsp;transplant center</p>



<p>For six years, Dr. D'Cunha had been working on building a multidisciplinary team of medical and surgical experts to create a new lung transplant program at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20203899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center</a>&nbsp;is the largest in the country, performing more adult solid organ transplants than any other center in the U.S. The addition of the lung transplant program establishes Mayo Clinic in Arizona as a comprehensive transplant destination medical center.</p>



<p>The program will provide transplantation for the full range of patients with end-stage lung disease. "This is the beginning of a remarkable new era for lung transplantation in Arizona," says Dr. D'Cunha. "We are excited and honored to offer patients and families renewed hope and a second chance at life through Mayo's unrivaled expertise in comprehensive adult organ transplant care."</p>



<p>Craig became the new program's first patient to receive a lung transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading has-large-font-size"><strong>Giving the gift of life</strong></h2>



<p>On May 30, 2025, Dr. D'Cunha led a team of surgeons in performing Craig's lung transplant. The surgery was a success, and soon after, Craig was slowly starting to breathe with his new lungs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It is surreal to be able to breathe and not gasp for air when I talk," says Craig, who was up and walking within days of surgery. "I told the doctors when I got here that I will do whatever it takes. I'm 100% committed. If you want me to walk six times a day, I'll walk seven," says Craig.</p>

<p>"He did phenomenal," says Dr. D'Cunha. "His optimism and energy he brought with him is absolutely critical because the stronger you are going into these big operations, the better you are on the other side.</p>



<p>"I'm very proud of Craig. He always amazing me throughout the journey of transplant," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/omar-ashraf-m-b-b-ch/bio-20553594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashraf Omar, M.B., B.Ch.</a>, medical director of the transplant program.

<p>Sue Baker started having issues with her heart in 2015. By 2019, she began experiencing heart failure. Living in Southeast Georgia, her condition landed her in the hospital seven times before the last visit led to her being transferred to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, nearly 90 minutes away, critically ill.</p>



<p>"She was really sick — in cardiogenic shock, intubated, connected to a breathing machine — she was not going to make it," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/patel-parag-c-m-d/bio-20055567">Dr. Parag Patel</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant cardiologist. "She only had three to six months to live, and we needed to act fast."</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (2:21) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/A-Mayo-first_Innovative-transplant-procedure-saves-patients-life-after-heart-failure_SCRIPT.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Sue's situation had become dire. She was presented with two options: enter hospice care or have a left <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-assist-device/about/pac-20384529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventricular assist device (LVAD)</a> implanted to serve as a bridge to a heart transplant. While she chose the LVAD to buy more time, by 2023 she was experiencing dangerous heart rhythms and other challenges.</p>



<p>Complicating matters, her body was producing more antibodies, making it increasingly difficult to find a suitable transplant donor.</p>



<p>"It was devastating to know that I'm actually going to die," says Sue. Still, she did not lose hope. "You just grab hold of God and keep praying," she says.</p>



<p>Sue's care team also remained determined to help her hold on. They explored an innovative approach — called Heart After Liver Transplant with a Domino Liver to another patient (HALT-D) — that had shown success in patients with similar antibody counts.</p>



<p>HALT-D, however, had never been attempted on someone with a heart pump like hers. This procedure would be a first for Mayo Clinic, at any of its transplant sites.</p>



<p>Although Sue's liver was healthy, she would need to get not just a heart transplant but also a donor liver to help remove the antibodies from her body and reduce the risk of her new heart being rejected. This meant a rare and complex domino transplant, involving both a liver and a heart, where Sue's liver would also become part of the donor chain.</p>



<p>"We take the liver of the patient who's receiving the heart after liver, and we take that liver and we put it into another recipient so that we do not waste an organ," says Patel.</p>



<p>Preparing for this complex procedure involved extensive multidisciplinary collaboration between a variety of Mayo Clinic departments. Sue spent months in the hospital, waiting for a match. During her wait, fellow patients and staff began calling her "mama" for the care and support she provided everyone else, despite her own challenges.</p>



<p>"We get to know each other and kind of help each other out," says Sue. "That was a lot of healing and helpfulness there."</p>

<p>"Sue not only helped people on the floor, but she's helped other patients who didn't have an opportunity" for transplant, says Patel.</p>



<p>Finally, in September 2024, the domino transplant was performed successfully.</p>



<p>Today, Sue is on the path to recovery, growing stronger each day. Her motivation to live is fueled by the desire to honor her donor, whose gift has given her a second chance at life.</p>



<p>"I would love to thank and meet the family," says Sue. "I'm not going to sit back and do nothing. That person will always be special."</p>



<p>Her story is a testament to the power of medical innovation, the dedication of healthcare professionals, and the resilience of the human spirit.</p>



<p>"I love her, and I appreciate the doctors and all the nurses that have been so loving and caring for Sue,” says Charlene Taylor, Sue's caretaker.</p>

<p></p>



<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a><strong> </strong>in Arizona announced it has added lung transplantation to its nationally recognized solid organ transplant program. The program delivers world-class care to critically ill patients battling end-stage lung disease who need a lung transplant to survive and restore their quality of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/lung-transplant/home/orc-20211835" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Lung Transplant Program in Arizona</a>&nbsp;offers a multidisciplinary team of medical and surgical experts in the Southwest, supported by clinical innovation from across Mayo Clinic, bringing unparalleled experience and the latest in research-driven care to every patient.</p>

<p>"With the launch of our new lung transplant program, we are reinforcing our commitment to providing category-of-one care to patients with serious and complex medical needs. This new program strengthens our nationally acclaimed solid organ transplant program in Arizona, giving more patients access to the transformative gift of renewed life," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/gray-richard-j-m-d/bio-20053485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Richard Gray,&nbsp;M.D.</a>, CEO of Mayo Clinic in Arizona.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/d-cunha-jonathan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20471123" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathan D'Cunha, M.D., Ph.D</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/d-cunha-jonathan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20471123">.</a>, surgical director of the transplant program, says the team of experts will provide transplantation for the full range of patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/pulmonary-medicine/sections/overview/ovc-20397865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end-stage lung disease</a>.</p>



<p>"This is the beginning of a remarkable new era for lung transplantation in Arizona," says Dr. D'Cunha. "We are excited and honored to offer patients and families renewed hope and a second chance at life through Mayo's unrivaled expertise in comprehensive adult organ transplant care."</p>



<p>Craig Scherer became the new program's first patient to undergo a lifesaving lung transplant on May 30. Soon after surgery, Craig was already beginning to breathe slowly on his own for the first time in years. He was discharged June 18 and is now back at home.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="610" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/confetti-pom-poms-cheering-discharge-1-1024x610.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-404202" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/confetti-pom-poms-cheering-discharge-1-1024x610.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/confetti-pom-poms-cheering-discharge-1-300x179.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/confetti-pom-poms-cheering-discharge-1-768x457.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/confetti-pom-poms-cheering-discharge-1-1536x915.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/confetti-pom-poms-cheering-discharge-1-2048x1220.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>The lung transplant teams on Craig's discharge day sending him home with a big celebration</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"It is surreal to be able to breathe again and not gasp for air. The reality has not even set in yet. I'm putting a lot of thought into finding the right words to express how deeply grateful I am for this gift," says Craig.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Craig is one of the millions worldwide who have suffered loss of lung function due to chronic respiratory diseases, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/copd-clinic/overview/ovc-20533949" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</a>, or COPD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the years, the progressive disease slowly robbed the Arizona man of his ability to breathe, leaving him dependent on oxygen tanks for survival. "I couldn't go places, couldn't do things. My quality of life was zero. I was always very anxious and afraid the tanks were going to run out," says Craig.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic lower respiratory diseases (CLRDs) are the fifth-leading killer in the U.S., according to a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db521.htm#Key_finding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 report</a>&nbsp;from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report cited CLRD as the cause of death for approximately 145,000 people in the U.S. in one year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Craig's wife, Nanci, says he also lost the ability to speak. "He didn't have the oxygen to talk. We lived in silence and isolated," says Nanci. The couple has been married for 32 years.</p>



<p>Eventually, Craig reached the final stage of lung failure. Oxygen tanks were no longer enough to help him breathe. "We were truly desperate. We were down to weeks," says Nanci. "I didn't think he would make it to his next birthday."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. D'Cunha led the team of surgical specialists that performed Craig's transplant. He said patients like Craig all too often reach a point where supplemental oxygen is no longer sufficient to meet their respiratory needs.</p>



<p>"There are no medical interventions at that point. They have run out of time," he says. "Lung transplant becomes the patient's only option. In Craig's case, without the transplant, it likely would have resulted in his death."</p>

<p>Three weeks after his transplant, with daily physical therapy, Craig is back to walking and talking like he did years ago. "It is not an easy journey," says Dr. D'Cunha. "But it's a journey that gives patients like Craig hope — to see his grandchildren, the next milestone, or whatever his goals may be."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/omar-ashraf-m-b-b-ch/bio-20553594" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashraf Omar, M.B., B.Ch.</a>,&nbsp;medical director of the lung transplant program, took note of Craig's determination from the start. "I'm proud of Craig. He has always amazed me," says Dr. Omar. "He's a special person. Motivation is the cornerstone of his success."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's new program in Arizona will offer the latest advancements in lung transplant innovation, including&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-research-breathes-new-air-into-donor-lungs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ex vivo lung perfusion</a>&nbsp;(EVLP), which is considered one of the most transformative breakthroughs in lung transplantation in recent years. EVLP improves the success of lung transplantation by helping preserve and evaluate donor lungs prior to transplant.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a>, with integrated programs in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arizona</a>, is the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/overview/ovc-20203894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nation's largest provider of adult solid organ transplantation</a>. Mayo Clinic in Arizona is on target to surpass its 2024 record number of&nbsp;<a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/data/view-data-reports/center-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 900 transplants</a>.</p>



<p>In the first week of June alone, the Arizona program successfully performed a record-breaking 36 transplants. The addition of the lung transplant program establishes Mayo Clinic in Arizona as a comprehensive transplant destination medical center.</p>



<p>"As the leader in organ transplantation in the country, we are committed to our vision where no patient dies while waiting for a lifesaving transplant," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>,&nbsp;director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona. "Our new program meets an urgent need for so many patients fighting to survive end-stage lung disease."</p>



<p>On June 23, Craig celebrated his 67<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday. He joined the team of surgeons who performed his lifesaving transplant for a news conference announcing the launch of the new transplantation program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The highlight of the event came when Craig addressed the crowd sharing what the transplant means to him. "These lungs are my 67<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;birthday gift," said Craig, his hands resting on his chest. "This is the best birthday gift I could get in the world. It gave me life."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Craig also expressed his gratitude for the staff at Mayo, the doctors, his family, his organ donor and the donor's family. "My heart goes out to the family. One day I hope I get to communicate my gratitude to them for giving me life. Most people don't get a second chance. I do," said Craig.</p>



<p>Dr. D'Cunha lit candles on a birthday cake for Craig in the shape of a set of lungs. In honor of the gift of life, Craig used his new lungs to blow out the candles with one single breath.&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FtCerSoeVehE&amp;data=05%7C02%7CHames.Marty%40mayo.edu%7C8a3c729adc264552b95c08ddb2b40dc9%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638863208567040051%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=qKoZGcRQbARsM0pA9ZrZZlSRNS7RlwBm5MW73bNUHrQ%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch the emotional moment that was met with cheers and applause in recognition of the gift of life.</a></p>



<p>Craig and Nanci returned home to spend the rest of his birthday with family. Together they share four children, 14 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I have a lot of life left to live in me. Everything is a motivator — my wife, my kids, my grandkids, my health," says Craig. "Before, I had no quality of life and couldn't do anything. Now there’s nothing I can't accomplish."</p>
