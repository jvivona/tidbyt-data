<p>"It was in the summer of 1998," Randy says. "We were having a lot of fires in Jacksonville along I-95, and (I was) having a hard time breathing."</p>



<p>Randy was 35 years old when his care team in Jacksonville, Florida, discovered he had an enlarged heart.</p>



<p>"I was in full-blown heart failure with fluid in my lungs," Randy says. "(My doctor) basically said, 'You need a heart transplant.' I couldn't believe it."</p>



<p>Randy was placed on the transplant list in Rochester, Minnesota, and spent almost three years traveling back and forth for appointments, waiting for a heart.</p>



<p>"My son must have been 8 or 9, and I knew that I had to survive to help raise him and support him," Randy says.</p>



<p>Then, in 2001, Mayo Clinic started a heart transplant program in Jacksonville, which gave Randy a chance to be closer to home.</p>



<p>"I met Dr. Yip when the program first started, and from day one, he and I have connected," Randy says. "I've always felt like I've had a personal connection with the team here, and it just made the whole process so much easier."</p>



<p>After listing and waiting several more months, the day finally came.</p>



<p>"I had my heart transplant on May 27, 2002," Randy says.</p>

<p>"You have someone who is literally on death's doorstep to be able to live a full, healthy life, back to things that they want to do, going back to work, raising their children, going to graduations, going to weddings, raising their grandchildren. That is satisfying," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yip-daniel-s-m-d/bio-20054324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Daniel Yip</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who helped start the heart transplant program in Florida.</p>



<p>Over the last quarter century, Dr. Yip has seen progress in heart transplantation — from advances in medications to new options for patients with the greatest need.</p>



<p>"Being able to expand the donor pool using organs that, in the past, we would say maybe we shouldn't think about using them, but knowing with time, with research, with innovation, with technology, to be able to use these organs," Dr. Yip says. "And now we're able to go a lot farther, even across the country, to be able to get the right heart for a patient. I think that's the biggest thing — to be able to serve patients who need our help."</p>

<p>According to the <a href="https://hrsa.unos.org/data/view-data-reports/national-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)</a>, nearly 4,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a heart transplant.</p>



<p>Randy is grateful for the years he's been given, and he's made it his mission to help others.</p>



<p>"My quality of life before transplant — being sick, being limited — was really hard because I'm go, go all the time," Randy says. "Just learn to live each day for today, live every day for today and appreciate life."</p>

<p><strong><em>With a failing heart and little hope of healing, Alan Lewis sunk into depression, gaining 330 pounds. After he came to Mayo, bariatric surgery enabled the transplant he'd sought for so many years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>



<p>Alan Lewis was lying on the floor — the only position that eased his discomfort — watching a football game. When a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a> commercial came on, the tagline seemed to leap off the screen.</p>



<p>"You know where to go."</p>



<p>With heart failure sapping his strength, Alan had begun to doubt there was an "other side" to his condition. At age 41, he'd already lived a decade with a poorly pumping heart, diagnosed during a hospital visit for a broken ankle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For years, Alan had relied on a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-assist-device/about/pac-20384529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left ventricular assist device</a>, or LVAD, to help his heart circulate blood through his body. After the first one malfunctioned, he received a second device in 2018.</p>



<p>What Alan really needed was a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/heart-transplant/sections/overview/ovc-20212168" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new heart.</a></p>



<p>Even after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/about/pac-20394258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a> helped him lose weight, he still wasn't added to the transplant list. "When we'd ask about transplant, our care team would just say, 'Oh, he's doing fine. Just keep doing what you're doing,'" says his wife, Vida.</p>



<p>As months became years, Alan's hope of healing waned. His mental health spiraled.</p>



<p>"I was a nervous wreck," he recalls. "What if the LVAD malfunctioned? What if there was a power failure? I was scared to go places, worried about backup batteries. I was in my head 24/7. It was torture."</p>



<p>Deeply depressed, Alan gained 330 pounds during the pandemic, reversing his previous weight loss. Without a clear path forward, he resigned himself to dying.</p>



<p>Then, in 2022, Alan saw the Mayo commercial — and Vida saw an opportunity. She made the decision for them. They were going to Rochester.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A journey toward hope</strong></h2>



<p>After driving from Chicago, weak and rapidly declining, Alan sought help from Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>There, Vida's long-simmering concern was confirmed —a tough-to-kill bacteria had infected the wiring that linked his LVAD to its external battery. The battery for his defibrillator was also dead, leaving him vulnerable to potentially deadly arrhythmias.</p>



<p>Right away, Alan received IV antibiotics, a new defibrillator and an introduction to the transplant team. "Day one, they spoke of transplant," says Vida. "I was shocked."</p>



<p>At his first follow-up visit, Sarah Schettle, a physician assistant on the LVAD team, could see the emotional strain of all that Alan and Vida had been through. "There was a lot of hesitancy — 'Will Mayo accept us?'" she recalls. "I also remember the hopefulness, the desire to know what was possible here."</p>



<p>Recognizing that Alan needed complex, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/multidisciplinary-team-approach/gnc-20203912" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multidisciplinary care</a>, the team began formulating a plan.</p>



<p>Within two weeks, the couple relocated to Rochester — and just one year into marriage, Vida unflinchingly pivoted to her new role as caregiver.</p>



<p>"It was embedded in me to love as hard and as much as you can," she says.</p>



<p>Vida vowed to do that for Alan.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Alan and Vida Lewis" class="wp-image-410481" style="width:644px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Alan-and-Vida-Lewis-16-x9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Throughout Alan's journey, his wife, Vida, advocated for his care.</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preparing for tomorrow</strong></h2>



<p>The team said Alan needed to adopt a healthier lifestyle before a second bariatric surgery — a necessary step toward transplant. So Vida signed them up for a gym. She walked next to him on a treadmill, urging him on. She made healthy meals. She pored over the lengthy care plan, still shocked that they had one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Back home, no one gave us clear answers. How long would he have the LVAD? Could he ever get a transplant?" she says. "At Mayo, we never experienced that. The focus was always on getting him well enough for a transplant, like he deserved to be transplanted."</p>



<p>Still, there was fear that the new heart wouldn’t happen. Sensing Alan's struggle, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/da-silva-de-abreu-adrian-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20540178" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adrian da Silva de Abreu, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, one of his cardiologists, spent an hour at his bedside, mostly listening.</p>



<p>"I'd never seen a doctor take that time," says Alan. "I put it all out there, and I could tell he was hearing me."</p>



<p>Peace replaced his once-crippling anxiety. At last, he knew his team wanted what was best for him. As Vida says, "They had a vision. They had a plan. It was healthcare like I've never seen before."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A risk with great reward</strong></h2>



<p>Alan's first bariatric surgery shrunk his stomach to the size of a banana.</p>



<p>To help him lose the weight he'd regained, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ghanem-omar-m-m-d/bio-20491179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Omar Ghanem, M.D.</a>, a bariatric surgeon, planned to reroute part of Alan's small intestine so food would bypass a long segment of his bowel. Known as a modified duodenal switch, this would reduce how many calories and nutrients he absorbed and alter the secretion of hunger-related hormones.</p>



<p>Dr. Ghanem knew the already complex surgery would be even more challenging in Alan's case. &nbsp;</p>



<p>With his heart essentially outside his body, monitoring — and maintaining — his vitals would be difficult. Blood thinners to prevent clots in his LVAD would also elevate his risk of bleeding. Then there was the looming infection, suppressed but still active, only curable if the LVAD was removed. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Seven Mayo Clinic teams — from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/infectious-diseases/sections/overview/ovc-20456906" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Infectious Diseases</a> to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/anesthesiology-and-perioperative-medicine/home/orc-20507831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anesthesiology</a> —&nbsp;worked together to help Alan beat the odds.</p>



<p>"Where else do you have all this expertise in one place? I don't think anything like this can be done outside of a place like Mayo," says Dr. Ghanem. "Here we're able to safely push the limits."</p>



<p>Knowing this path was his best chance at healing, Alan and Vida agreed to go forward.</p>



<p>Despite its complexity, the revision was a success, and so was the recovery.&nbsp;Within months, Alan lost enough weight to qualify for a heart. He was finally on the transplant list. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moving forward at last</strong></h2>



<p>Six weeks later, a middle-of-the-night call brought Alan back to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>After years of heart failure, two LVADs, two bariatric surgeries, dozens of pounds lost and hundreds of tears shed, Alan was receiving another chance at life. He was receiving a new heart.</p>



<p>Less than five hours after opening his chest, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/spencer-philip-j-m-d/bio-20527536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Philip Spencer, M.D.</a>, a cardiovascular and transplant surgeon, brought Alan to the "other side" of heart failure — that place he'd once thought didn't exist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"We had an infection to deal with. And there was scarring within his chest," says Dr. Spencer. "But, once the LVAD was out, it went very well." &nbsp;</p>



<p>IV steroids enabled his body to accept the organ, and with the LVAD out, his infection could finally clear. Even from his hospital bed, Alan felt his confidence returning.</p>



<p>"I'd had this yoke on me. I couldn't move without the LVAD. I couldn't bathe without it. I couldn't eat without it. It was always present," he says. "Mentally, I'd been down so long. Now I had freedom."</p>



<p>For the first time in years, there were no wires to wrestle with. There was no battery to worry about.</p>



<p>Alan could be himself again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new life for Alan</strong></h2>



<p>With Alan's heart fully functioning, the couple is now back in Chicago, enjoying a renewed zeal for life.</p>



<p>For Alan, that means showing his gratitude for everyone who supported him — his family, his close friends and, of course, Vida. Every day, he focuses on caring for her in every way possible. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"When I wake up, I start catering to her," he says. "She had to cook and clean. She helped bathe me and put on my shoes and socks. It's a joy for me to be able to do things for her now."</p>



<p>During the night, Alan sometimes reaches across the mattress, making sure Vida is still there, even though he knows she always will be. She is his safe person, and Mayo Clinic is the safe place that showed him what healthcare should be.</p>



<p>Both their hearts remain in Minnesota, where hope first began to beat, strong and steady, in Alan's chest. The tagline from a football game ad — "You know where to go" — still feels like a summons.</p>



<p>"To have so many people involved in your care, and each one be a beautiful experience, is so rare," says Vida. "God has blessed him, and Mayo has been there for him. We want to move back because Rochester feels like home, you know?"</p>

<p>"This number represents new beginnings full of hope for so many," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>, transplant surgeon and director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant in Rochester</a>. "This incredible milestone is only made possible by the generosity of our donors and donor families, the resilience of our transplant recipients, and the unwavering dedication of our transplant care teams."</p>



<p>The record volume is encouraging, as the number of patients waiting on the national transplant list remains daunting. <a href="https://unos.org/data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">More than 109,000 people in the U.S.</a> are currently waiting for lifesaving organs, according to OPTN data. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</ul>



<p>"Our work doesn't stop with the patients we serve today," says Dr. Heimbach.

<p>For Loren Vinal, the holidays have always carried a gentle kind of magic. Loren's hometown of Corning, New York, and his winters on Jekyll Island, Georgia, offered two peaceful places where music and community shaped his daily life.</p>



<p>In late 2017, everything changed. After months of worsening shortness of breath and repeated misdiagnoses, Loren — a guitarist with 40 years of experience — flew to Nashville, Tennessee,&nbsp;to play a show with a friend.&nbsp;Loren&nbsp;ended up in the&nbsp;emergency department&nbsp;before he could play&nbsp;—&nbsp;diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/news/advanced-heart-failure-complexities-and-when-to-refer-for-specialty-care/mqc-20504989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advanced heart failure</a>.&nbsp;He remembers the shock of that moment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Out of the blue, my life&nbsp;completely&nbsp;shifted,"&nbsp;Loren says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After&nbsp;receiving that diagnosis, Loren spent&nbsp;13 days&nbsp;in the hospital&nbsp;in Nashville.&nbsp;Once stable,&nbsp;he&nbsp;returned to&nbsp;upstate&nbsp;New York and continued care at&nbsp;a&nbsp;local hospital&nbsp;where specialists determined he needed a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ventricular-assist-device/about/pac-20384529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left ventricular assist device (LVAD)</a>. The <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-heart-patients-helped-by-ventricular-assist-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LVAD&nbsp;</a>is&nbsp;a mechanical pump that supports the heart by helping the left ventricle circulate blood throughout the body.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After&nbsp;about seven years with the LVAD, new&nbsp;complications&nbsp;in 2024 meant it was time to revisit transplant. By then, Lorena already&nbsp;knew&nbsp;about&nbsp;Mayo&nbsp;Clinic in Florida. Years earlier, he had been transferred there from a nearby hospital while wintering on Jekyll Island because smaller hospitals were not equipped to manage&nbsp;patients&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;LVAD.</p>



<p>Loren&nbsp;never&nbsp;forgot&nbsp;the care&nbsp;he received then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I was&nbsp;so impressed with the dedication and professionalism at Mayo Clinic,"&nbsp;Loren says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When he learned he was a strong&nbsp;candidate&nbsp;for heart transplant,&nbsp;he says&nbsp;the decision to pursue care&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic&nbsp;felt right.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Heart transplant</h2>



<p>Loren received his first heart&nbsp;transplant&nbsp;on July 1, 2024.&nbsp;However, due to unforeseen circumstances, Loren would need another new heart, and he was relisted on the transplant waiting list in May 2025.&nbsp;He spent nine and a half weeks&nbsp;waiting in the hospital&nbsp;before receiving his second heart&nbsp;transplant&nbsp;on July 19, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Waiting was difficult, but he felt supported at every turn.&nbsp;Today,&nbsp;Loren&nbsp;shares that&nbsp;he&nbsp;exercises&nbsp;and&nbsp;plays music again&nbsp;—&nbsp;feeling stronger with each passing day.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"A good working heart changes everything,"&nbsp;Loren says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Loren speaks openly about the&nbsp;gratitude he feels toward his&nbsp;donors who&nbsp;gave him the incredible gift of&nbsp;life. "It&nbsp;is the greatest gift you can bestow on another human," he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Throughout his journey, Loren learned more about the scope of Mayo Clinic's commitment to transplantation.&nbsp;As one of the largest and most comprehensive transplant programs in the world,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a>&nbsp;provides seamless care across&nbsp;heart, lung, liver, kidney, pancreas&nbsp;and&nbsp;bone&nbsp;marrow&nbsp;transplantation&nbsp;for both adults and children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The transplant center&nbsp;teams in Arizona,&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;and Minnesota work together to advance innovation,&nbsp;research&nbsp;and education, shaping the future of transplantation worldwide.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic also leads research in organ preservation, living donation and regenerative medicine, guided by a vision that no patient should die while waiting for a transplant. These advances have helped expand access for patients with complex needs and support successful outcomes like Loren's.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Loren showed extraordinary resilience,"&nbsp;says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/yip-daniel-s-m-d/bio-20054324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr.&nbsp;Daniel&nbsp;Yip</a>,&nbsp;transplant&nbsp;cardiologist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.&nbsp;"Even in the face of profound&nbsp;challenges, he&nbsp;remained&nbsp;engaged and hopeful. Our team was committed to walking every step of this with him."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Loren looks toward the&nbsp;new year with a new heart, he feels a deeper joy in the moments he once took for granted:&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong, steady heartbeat;&nbsp;music&nbsp;returning&nbsp;to his fingertips;&nbsp;and time with the people he loves.</p>



<p>"I&nbsp;sincerely thank&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;involved,&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope to continue to pay it forward,"&nbsp;Loren says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>His story now carries its own quiet holiday light&nbsp;—&nbsp;hope renewed, life restored and gratitude that stretches far beyond the season.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Dressed as Santa, kidney transplant recipient Dan Reed returned&nbsp;to Mayo Clinic to thank his transplant team and spread holiday cheer.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I knew 2025 would be a big year for me,"&nbsp;Dan&nbsp;says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Dan,&nbsp;May&nbsp;2025&nbsp;brought&nbsp;the greatest gift&nbsp;of all:&nbsp;the gift of life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dan's journey to transplant first&nbsp;came to light&nbsp;in 2024, when he shared his story publicly while awaiting a kidney transplant. That journey came full circle this holiday season when he returned to the Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota&nbsp;—&nbsp;this time healthy, thriving and dressed in a familiar red suit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Not only are kidney transplants possible,&nbsp;they're&nbsp;doable,&nbsp;life-changing.&nbsp;And Mayo is just a phenomenal place to have it done,"&nbsp;Dan says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each holiday season, Dan volunteers as Santa, spreading joy and connection within the community. This year, he wanted that tradition of giving to include the Mayo Clinic transplant team who supported him through his transplant journey.&nbsp;</p>

</div>


<p>Dan was joined by&nbsp;Steve&nbsp;Eckhouse, his best friend of more than 40 years and the person who helped&nbsp;initiate&nbsp;the living donor chain that&nbsp;ultimately led&nbsp;to Dan receiving a kidney. Together,&nbsp;they visited&nbsp;Mayo&nbsp;Clinic&nbsp;physicians, nurses, transplant&nbsp;coordinators&nbsp;and staff to personally express their gratitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I was happy to learn&nbsp;that&nbsp;anybody could possibly be eligible&nbsp;(to be a donor),"&nbsp;Steve says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the transplant team, the visit offered a meaningful opportunity to see the impact of their work&nbsp;—&nbsp;from a patient thriving after&nbsp;transplant, to the friend who helped make it possible.&nbsp;</p>

<p-->ROCHESTER, Minn.&nbsp;—&nbsp;From AI-powered drug discovery to regenerative therapies and next-generation neurology tools,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers made significant strides in 2025 toward predicting,&nbsp;preventing&nbsp;and&nbsp;treating&nbsp;some of the world's most serious and complex diseases.&nbsp;<p></p>



<p>These discoveries reflect progress across three major innovation&nbsp;efforts&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;Mayo Clinic clinicians and scientists are working together&nbsp;to&nbsp;develop tools to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions through the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/search/?search=%22Precure%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Precure initiative</a>.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are advancing new cures for end-organ failure beyond traditional transplantation&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/search/?search=%22Genesis%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis initiative</a>. They are also uniting clinical insight with&nbsp;cutting-edge engineering to deliver novel&nbsp;neurological&nbsp;diagnostics and therapies through the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/search/?search=%22Bioelectronics+Neuromodulation+Innovation+to+Cure%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bioelectronics&nbsp;Neuromodulation Innovation to Cure (BIONIC) initiative</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have created "virtual clinical trials"&nbsp;that&nbsp;advance&nbsp;the discovery of therapies while reducing time,&nbsp;cost&nbsp;and the risk of failed studies by combining advanced computer modeling with real-world patient data&nbsp;as part of the Precure and Genesis initiatives. Through one virtual clinical trial, they have developed a new way to predict whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat heart failure, one of the world's most pressing health challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Clinical trials will always remain essential," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cui&nbsp;Tao,&nbsp;Ph.D.</a>, the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair&nbsp;of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics and vice president of Mayo Clinic Platform Informatics. "But this innovation demonstrates how AI can make research more efficient, affordable and broadly accessible. Integrating trial emulation, simulation,&nbsp;synthetic&nbsp;trials&nbsp;and biomedical knowledge modeling opens the door to a new paradigm in translational science."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have uncovered the molecular "switch" that directs a small but powerful set of cells that choose&nbsp;whether to repair tissue or fight infection, a discovery that could inform regenerative therapies for chronic lung diseases, which is part of Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We were surprised to find that these specialized cells cannot do both jobs at once," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brownfield-douglas-g-ph-d/bio-20522531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64224-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>. "Some commit to rebuilding, while others focus on defense. That division of labor is essential — and by uncovering the switch that controls it, we can start thinking about how to restore balance when it breaks down in disease."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;found&nbsp;that&nbsp;injecting&nbsp;patients' own stem cells from fat cells into the vein before hemodialysis, a treatment for end-stage kidney disease, often&nbsp;helped prevent inflammation and vein narrowing. This could help millions of people tolerate dialysis longer, extending the time before they&nbsp;require&nbsp;a kidney transplant as part of the&nbsp;Mayo Clinic&nbsp;Genesis initiative.&nbsp;</p>

The study also found that autoimmune diseases occur most often in women, and it identified the top autoimmune diseases by prevalence, sex and age.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>"Knowing the number of patients with an autoimmune disease in the U.S. is critical to assess whether these diseases are increasing or decreasing over time and with treatment," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;vice-chair of translational research for the&nbsp;Department of Cardiovascular Medicine&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Florida and corresponding author of the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.<br><br>###&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I was meeting my girlfriends for breakfast," Barbara says. "She actually worked in the World Trade Center. When the actual plane hit the tower, I wasn't right up on the towers, but I was where you could see it."</p>



<p>What followed that day would change Barbara's health and life forever.</p>



<p>"All of this stuff that was in your lungs," Barbara recalls.</p>



<p>Over time, Brown started to notice changes in her health. Then, a pivotal moment in 2006 while being a mom to an active 2-year-old girl.</p>



<p>"(My daughter) jumped up in my arms, and I kind of fell backward. And I fell down, and I couldn't hold her," Barbara says. "That was the first big thing with my lungs."</p>



<p>Barbara was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interstitial lung disease</a>, where inflammation and scarring make it difficult to breathe. Doctors explained that someday she would need a lung transplant.</p>



<p>"I looked at this little girl that I had, and I said, 'You know, if I'm going to fight, I'm going to fight for her, you know,'" Barbara says. "And so that's what I chose to do."</p>



<p>Barbara spent much of the next decade searching for a transplant program that would be the right fit. She traveled across the country speaking with care teams and taking evaluations — all while her lungs grew weaker. Then, Mayo Clinic entered her life.</p>

<p>"Barbara came through our doors, referred to us from an outside provider, with a disease that was fairly advanced," <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/narula-tathagat-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20305908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Tathagat Narula</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> pulmonologist, says. "She was on a lot of oxygen, very, very sick."</p>



<p>After qualifying for a double-lung transplant and spending time on the waiting list, Barbara got the call in April 2017.</p>



<p>"It's the scariest thing in the world because now you're looking at everybody and you're like, 'This is it!'" Barbara says. "'This is really it!'"</p>



<p>Recovery would be long, but after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/physical-medicine-rehabilitation-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20467039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical therapy</a> to regain her strength, Barbara was breathing without assistance and ready to pick up where her life had paused. The journey has also inspired her to share her story and dispel misconceptions about transplant.</p>

</div>


<p>"I decided that I was going to really write about my experience," Barbara says. "If I can do something to get the information out there, and I said, 'I'm going to maybe attempt at it this way.'"</p>



<p>"In Barbara's case, she has had this opportunity to see her daughter grow up, go to college," Dr. Narula says. " Barbara is writing a book to share her journey, to share her story with the wider audience. What more can you ask for?"</p>



<p>Eight and a half years after transplant, she's happy and excited for her next chapter.</p>



<p>"Do I look like someone who's been through a double-lung transplant? No, but what does someone look like? If someone says I look like a happy person, then that's what I would prefer looking like," Barbara says.</p>

<p><em>November is Diabetes Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diabetes</a> affects how the body uses glucose, also known as blood sugar. It can mean that there is too much sugar in the blood. This can harm people in several ways. One serious complication is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ivan Porter II, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nephrology-hypertension/sections/overview/ovc-20464571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nephrologist</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Florida, explains the connection between diabetes and chronic kidney disease.</p>



<p>Up to 40% of people with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, <a href="https://diabetesatlas.org/resources/idf-diabetes-atlas-reports/diabetes-and-kidney-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global statistics show</a>. Their kidneys cannot effectively do their most important job, which is regulating the composition of the blood by filtering out waste and maintaining the balance and amount of salt and water in the body.</p>



<p>Chronic kidney disease may be advanced before symptoms appear and a person is diagnosed. It can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which can be fatal without <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeon-living-kidney-donation-medical-advances-help-patients-avoid-dialysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a>.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 1</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2</a> diabetes can lead to chronic kidney disease. Type 2 diabetes is a far more common cause. With either type, the body can't produce enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps the body convert sugar into energy. Because one of the kidneys' most important jobs is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqsnI_PBKRI&amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning the blood</a>, they help regulate blood glucose levels, Dr. Porter explains.</p>



<p>"The high levels of circulating glucose in the blood are poisonous to nerves and blood vessels, and the kidneys are a big ball of blood vessels," Dr. Porter says. "The presence of high glucose leads to chemical changes that cause protein in urine, and the presence of protein in urine directly activates factors that cause scarring and fibrosis within the kidney, leading to worsening of kidney disease."</p>



<p>How diabetes and chronic kidney disease overlap and interact with each other is complex. Too much glucose in the blood can damage the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease. At the same time, declining kidney function related to chronic kidney disease can lead to insulin resistance, which can cause type 2 diabetes. In addition, declining kidney function can worsen preexisting diabetes.</p>



<p>The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications such as chronic kidney disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are five stages of kidney disease, based on the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/creatinine-test/about/pac-20384646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glomerular filtration rate</a> (GFR). The GFR measures how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood. The stages are:</p>

<p>"For patients with severe heart failure, there are very few options beyond mechanical pumps or transplants. We hope this approach will offer a new way to repair their own hearts," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zhu-wuqiang-m-d-ph-d/bio-20465805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuqiang Zhu, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174270612500649X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Acta Biomaterialia and a cardiovascular researcher at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reversing the irreversible</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart attacks</a> remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, oxygen-starved cells die and are replaced by scar tissue that cannot contract or conduct electrical signals — weakening the heart’s ability to pump blood.</p>



<p>"The adult human heart doesn't regenerate once those cells are lost," Dr. Zhu explains. "That's why heart failure, especially chronic heart failure due to the loss of functional cardiac muscle, is often difficult to treat; the muscle simply can't repair itself."</p>



<p>For years, scientists have been working on ways to replace damaged tissue with healthy heart cells derived from stem cells. Early efforts showed promise, but most required open-heart surgery<a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;</a>a procedure too risky for many patients already struggling with severe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists have long hoped that stem cells could provide a way to rebuild what the body cannot. By reprogramming ordinary adult cells such as skin or blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers can coax them into becoming replacement heart cells.</p>



<p>But safely and effectively delivering engineered heart tissues made from these cells has remained a major challenge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Innovation at heart</strong></h2>



<p>In collaboration with engineers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Mayo researchers developed a flexible, paper-thin patch made of nano- and microfibers coated with gelatin. This hybrid scaffold supports a blend of human heart muscle cells, blood vessel cells and fibroblasts—cells that form the tissue’s structural framework—to create a living, beating piece of heart tissue. Before transplantation, the tissue is infused with bioactive factors such as fibroblast growth factor 1 and CHIR99021 that encourage the growth of new blood vessels and help the cells survive once they are in place.</p>



<p>"The beauty of this design," says Dr. Zhu, "is that it can be folded like a piece of paper, loaded into a slender tube, and delivered precisely where it's needed through a small incision in the chest. Once in place, it unfolds and adheres naturally to the heart's surface."</p>



<p>Instead of using stitches, the team used a biocompatible surgical adhesive that holds the patch in place while minimizing additional trauma to the surrounding tissue.</p>



<p>Testing in preclinical models showed that the minimally invasive method improved heart function, reduced scarring, enhanced vascular growth and lessened inflammation compared with conventional approaches.</p>



<p>"Our results show that these engineered tissues not only survive but actually help the heart heal itself," says Dr. Zhu. "That's the ultimate goal: to replace what's lost and restore function."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A step toward regeneration</strong></h2>



<p>The research aligns closely with Mayo Clinic's Genesis Initiative, which aims to accelerate discoveries that restore or regenerate human organs and tissues.</p>



<p>"Genesis is about pioneering new ways to repair and rebuild the human body," Dr. Zhu says. "What we're doing here is exactly that — using regenerative science and minimally invasive delivery to give the heart a chance to recover."</p>



<p>Currently, more than 4,000 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplants</a> are performed in the United States each year, while thousands more patients die waiting for a donor organ. Dr. Zhu hopes this technology could eventually offer another option.</p>



<p>"Our vision," he says, "is that patients could one day receive engineered heart tissue made from their own reprogrammed cells, delivered through a minimally invasive procedure — no donor organ, no long recovery, just a repaired heart."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The Mayo Clinic team plans to advance this work through larger-scale preclinical testing to ensure the therapy's safety and effectiveness before moving to human clinical trials, a process that Dr. Zhu estimates could take five years or more.</p>



<p>"Heart failure remains a devastating condition," he says. "If we can make stem cell treatment accessible to more patients, especially those too fragile for open-heart surgery, we could save lives."</p>

<p>"Every transplant represents the work of an extraordinary team dedicated to restoring hope and health," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Burcin Taner</a>,&nbsp;chair of the Department of Transplantation at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Reaching this milestone reflects our clinical excellence and the trust our patients place in Mayo Clinic. Together, we're shaping the next era of transplantation — one defined by innovation, collaboration and compassion."</p>



<p>The Florida Transplant Program began as a liver transplant program. Kidney transplant was added in 2000, followed by heart and lung transplants in 2001. The transplant program reports some of the highest survival rates, the lowest median wait times and the highest volumes in the country, according to the <a href="https://www.srtr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients</a>.</p>



<p>The 10,000th transplant places the program among the top transplant centers nationwide for overall transplant volume. Additionally, the transplant center is on track for a record volume year, having performed more than 465 procedures by Oct. 29.</p>



<p>Nationally, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center</a>, which offers transplant services at its campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, is a leader in treating patients with heart disease. Combined volumes rank Mayo Clinic first among all adult transplant centers in the nation.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic physicians have experience treating patients with complex conditions who may need <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/multiorgan-transplants/gnc-20203913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiorgan transplants</a>, including heart-lung, kidney-pancreas, heart-lung-liver transplants and more.</p>



<p>"Every transplant tells a story of teamwork, trust and commitment," Dr. Taner says. "The growing volume of transplants at Mayo Clinic is the ultimate testament that our patients value our expertise and sense the dedication behind our care."</p>
