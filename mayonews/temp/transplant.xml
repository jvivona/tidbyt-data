<p>"I was meeting my girlfriends for breakfast," Barbara says. "She actually worked in the World Trade Center. When the actual plane hit the tower, I wasn't right up on the towers, but I was where you could see it."</p>



<p>What followed that day would change Barbara's health and life forever.</p>



<p>"All of this stuff that was in your lungs," Barbara recalls.</p>



<p>Over time, Brown started to notice changes in her health. Then, a pivotal moment in 2006 while being a mom to an active 2-year-old girl.</p>



<p>"(My daughter) jumped up in my arms, and I kind of fell backward. And I fell down, and I couldn't hold her," Barbara says. "That was the first big thing with my lungs."</p>



<p>Barbara was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/interstitial-lung-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interstitial lung disease</a>, where inflammation and scarring make it difficult to breathe. Doctors explained that someday she would need a lung transplant.</p>



<p>"I looked at this little girl that I had, and I said, 'You know, if I'm going to fight, I'm going to fight for her, you know,'" Barbara says. "And so that's what I chose to do."</p>



<p>Barbara spent much of the next decade searching for a transplant program that would be the right fit. She traveled across the country speaking with care teams and taking evaluations — all while her lungs grew weaker. Then, Mayo Clinic entered her life.</p>

<p>"Barbara came through our doors, referred to us from an outside provider, with a disease that was fairly advanced," <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/narula-tathagat-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20305908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Tathagat Narula</a>, a Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a> pulmonologist, says. "She was on a lot of oxygen, very, very sick."</p>



<p>After qualifying for a double-lung transplant and spending time on the waiting list, Barbara got the call in April 2017.</p>



<p>"It's the scariest thing in the world because now you're looking at everybody and you're like, 'This is it!'" Barbara says. "'This is really it!'"</p>



<p>Recovery would be long, but after <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/physical-medicine-rehabilitation-mayo-clinic/sections/overview/ovc-20467039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical therapy</a> to regain her strength, Barbara was breathing without assistance and ready to pick up where her life had paused. The journey has also inspired her to share her story and dispel misconceptions about transplant.</p>

<p>"I decided that I was going to really write about my experience," Barbara says. "If I can do something to get the information out there, and I said, 'I'm going to maybe attempt at it this way.'"</p>



<p>"In Barbara's case, she has had this opportunity to see her daughter grow up, go to college," Dr. Narula says. " Barbara is writing a book to share her journey, to share her story with the wider audience. What more can you ask for?"</p>



<p>Eight and a half years after transplant, she's happy and excited for her next chapter.</p>



<p>"Do I look like someone who's been through a double-lung transplant? No, but what does someone look like? If someone says I look like a happy person, then that's what I would prefer looking like," Barbara says.</p>

<p><em>November is Diabetes Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diabetes</a> affects how the body uses glucose, also known as blood sugar. It can mean that there is too much sugar in the blood. This can harm people in several ways. One serious complication is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ivan Porter II, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nephrology-hypertension/sections/overview/ovc-20464571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nephrologist</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Florida, explains the connection between diabetes and chronic kidney disease.</p>



<p>Up to 40% of people with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, <a href="https://diabetesatlas.org/resources/idf-diabetes-atlas-reports/diabetes-and-kidney-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global statistics show</a>. Their kidneys cannot effectively do their most important job, which is regulating the composition of the blood by filtering out waste and maintaining the balance and amount of salt and water in the body.</p>



<p>Chronic kidney disease may be advanced before symptoms appear and a person is diagnosed. It can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which can be fatal without <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeon-living-kidney-donation-medical-advances-help-patients-avoid-dialysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a>.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 1</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2</a> diabetes can lead to chronic kidney disease. Type 2 diabetes is a far more common cause. With either type, the body can't produce enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps the body convert sugar into energy. Because one of the kidneys' most important jobs is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqsnI_PBKRI&amp;amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning the blood</a>, they help regulate blood glucose levels, Dr. Porter explains.</p>



<p>"The high levels of circulating glucose in the blood are poisonous to nerves and blood vessels, and the kidneys are a big ball of blood vessels," Dr. Porter says. "The presence of high glucose leads to chemical changes that cause protein in urine, and the presence of protein in urine directly activates factors that cause scarring and fibrosis within the kidney, leading to worsening of kidney disease."</p>



<p>How diabetes and chronic kidney disease overlap and interact with each other is complex. Too much glucose in the blood can damage the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease. At the same time, declining kidney function related to chronic kidney disease can lead to insulin resistance, which can cause type 2 diabetes. In addition, declining kidney function can worsen preexisting diabetes.</p>



<p>The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications such as chronic kidney disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There are five stages of kidney disease, based on the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/creatinine-test/about/pac-20384646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glomerular filtration rate</a> (GFR). The GFR measures how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood. The stages are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 1.</strong>&amp;nbsp;At this stage, the GFR is 90 or higher, which is considered a healthy level. However, there is also another indicator of kidney disease present, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/protein-in-urine/basics/causes/sym-20050656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protein in the urine</a>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 2.</strong>&amp;nbsp;At this stage, the GFR is 60 to 89.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 3.</strong>&amp;nbsp;This stage is broken down into two subtypes — stage 3a and stage 3b. With 3a, the GFR is 45 to 59, and there is mild to moderate decline in kidney function. With 3b, the GFR is 30 to 44, and there is a more severe decline in kidney function.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 4.</strong>&amp;nbsp;The GFR is 15 to 29, and kidney decline is severe.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 5.</strong>&amp;nbsp;This stage is considered <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end-stage renal disease</a>, also called kidney failure. The GFR is under 15. At this point, dialysis or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> is needed.</li>
</ul>



<p>Most often, chronic kidney disease is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-diagnosed-with-chronic-kidney-disease-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosed</a> in stage 3 or later.</p>



<p>"The presence of other comorbidities, such as uncontrolled <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>, uncontrolled diabetes or the presence of protein in the urine, can make what might seem like an earlier stage worse for someone," Dr. Porter says.</p>



<p>Not everyone living with diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease.

<p>"For patients with severe heart failure, there are very few options beyond mechanical pumps or transplants. We hope this approach will offer a new way to repair their own hearts," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zhu-wuqiang-m-d-ph-d/bio-20465805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuqiang Zhu, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174270612500649X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Acta Biomaterialia and a cardiovascular researcher at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reversing the irreversible</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart attacks</a> remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, oxygen-starved cells die and are replaced by scar tissue that cannot contract or conduct electrical signals — weakening the heart’s ability to pump blood.</p>



<p>"The adult human heart doesn't regenerate once those cells are lost," Dr. Zhu explains. "That's why heart failure, especially chronic heart failure due to the loss of functional cardiac muscle, is often difficult to treat; the muscle simply can't repair itself."</p>



<p>For years, scientists have been working on ways to replace damaged tissue with healthy heart cells derived from stem cells. Early efforts showed promise, but most required open-heart surgery<a>&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;</a>a procedure too risky for many patients already struggling with severe&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists have long hoped that stem cells could provide a way to rebuild what the body cannot. By reprogramming ordinary adult cells such as skin or blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers can coax them into becoming replacement heart cells.</p>



<p>But safely and effectively delivering engineered heart tissues made from these cells has remained a major challenge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Innovation at heart</strong></h2>



<p>In collaboration with engineers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Mayo researchers developed a flexible, paper-thin patch made of nano- and microfibers coated with gelatin. This hybrid scaffold supports a blend of human heart muscle cells, blood vessel cells and fibroblasts—cells that form the tissue’s structural framework—to create a living, beating piece of heart tissue. Before transplantation, the tissue is infused with bioactive factors such as fibroblast growth factor 1 and CHIR99021 that encourage the growth of new blood vessels and help the cells survive once they are in place.</p>



<p>"The beauty of this design," says Dr. Zhu, "is that it can be folded like a piece of paper, loaded into a slender tube, and delivered precisely where it's needed through a small incision in the chest. Once in place, it unfolds and adheres naturally to the heart's surface."</p>



<p>Instead of using stitches, the team used a biocompatible surgical adhesive that holds the patch in place while minimizing additional trauma to the surrounding tissue.</p>



<p>Testing in preclinical models showed that the minimally invasive method improved heart function, reduced scarring, enhanced vascular growth and lessened inflammation compared with conventional approaches.</p>



<p>"Our results show that these engineered tissues not only survive but actually help the heart heal itself," says Dr. Zhu. "That's the ultimate goal: to replace what's lost and restore function."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A step toward regeneration</strong></h2>



<p>The research aligns closely with Mayo Clinic's Genesis Initiative, which aims to accelerate discoveries that restore or regenerate human organs and tissues.</p>



<p>"Genesis is about pioneering new ways to repair and rebuild the human body," Dr. Zhu says. "What we're doing here is exactly that — using regenerative science and minimally invasive delivery to give the heart a chance to recover."</p>



<p>Currently, more than 4,000 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplants</a> are performed in the United States each year, while thousands more patients die waiting for a donor organ. Dr. Zhu hopes this technology could eventually offer another option.</p>



<p>"Our vision," he says, "is that patients could one day receive engineered heart tissue made from their own reprogrammed cells, delivered through a minimally invasive procedure — no donor organ, no long recovery, just a repaired heart."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The Mayo Clinic team plans to advance this work through larger-scale preclinical testing to ensure the therapy's safety and effectiveness before moving to human clinical trials, a process that Dr. Zhu estimates could take five years or more.</p>



<p>"Heart failure remains a devastating condition," he says. "If we can make stem cell treatment accessible to more patients, especially those too fragile for open-heart surgery, we could save lives."</p>

<p>"Every transplant represents the work of an extraordinary team dedicated to restoring hope and health," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Burcin Taner</a>,&amp;nbsp;chair of the Department of Transplantation at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Reaching this milestone reflects our clinical excellence and the trust our patients place in Mayo Clinic. Together, we're shaping the next era of transplantation — one defined by innovation, collaboration and compassion."</p>



<p>The Florida Transplant Program began as a liver transplant program. Kidney transplant was added in 2000, followed by heart and lung transplants in 2001. The transplant program reports some of the highest survival rates, the lowest median wait times and the highest volumes in the country, according to the <a href="https://www.srtr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients</a>.</p>



<p>The 10,000th transplant places the program among the top transplant centers nationwide for overall transplant volume. Additionally, the transplant center is on track for a record volume year, having performed more than 465 procedures by Oct. 29.</p>



<p>Nationally, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center</a>, which offers transplant services at its campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, is a leader in treating patients with heart disease. Combined volumes rank Mayo Clinic first among all adult transplant centers in the nation.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic physicians have experience treating patients with complex conditions who may need <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/multiorgan-transplants/gnc-20203913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiorgan transplants</a>, including heart-lung, kidney-pancreas, heart-lung-liver transplants and more.</p>



<p>"Every transplant tells a story of teamwork, trust and commitment," Dr. Taner says. "The growing volume of transplants at Mayo Clinic is the ultimate testament that our patients value our expertise and sense the dedication behind our care."</p>

<p>When a person's lungs are damaged, that organ's survival depends on a small but powerful set of cells that must choose whether to repair the tissue or fight infection. A new Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64224-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> has uncovered the molecular "switch" that directs these cells down one path or the other, a discovery that could inform regenerative therapies for chronic lung diseases.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-683x1024.jpg" alt="Photo headshot of Dr. Brownfield" class="wp-image-406480" style="width:182px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001.jpg 1095w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We were surprised to find that these specialized cells cannot do both jobs at once," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brownfield-douglas-g-ph-d/bio-20522531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.,</a> senior author of the study, which was published in Nature Communications. "Some commit to rebuilding, while others focus on defense. That division of labor is essential — and by uncovering the switch that controls it, we can start thinking about how to restore balance when it breaks down in disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It takes two</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The new research centers on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which play a dual role in the lung. These cube-shaped cells secrete surfactant proteins that keep air sacs open, but they also act as reserve stem cells capable of regenerating alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells — the paper-thin cells that form the surface for gas exchange. This regenerative capacity makes AT2 cells essential for lung repair after injury.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists have known that these cells often fail to regenerate properly in lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe viral infections like COVID-19. What remained unclear was how AT2 cells lose their stem cell capacity.</p>



<p>Using single-cell sequencing, imaging and preclinical injury models, the team mapped the developmental "life history" of AT2 cells. They found that newly formed AT2 cells stay flexible for about one to two weeks after birth before "locking in" to their specialized identity.</p>



<p>That timing is controlled by a molecular circuit involving three key regulators called PRC2, C/EBPα, and DLK1. The researchers showed that one of them, C/EBPα, acts like a clamp that suppresses stem cell activity. In adult lungs, AT2 cells must release this clamp after injury to regenerate.</p>



<p>The same molecular switch also directs whether AT2 cells repair lung tissue or defend against infection. That helps explain why infections often slow recovery from lung disease.</p>



<p>"When we think about lung repair, it's not just about turning things on — it's about removing the clamps that normally keep these cells from acting like stem cells," says Dr. Brownfield. "We discovered one of those clamps and how it times the ability of these cells to repair."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing organ failure</strong></h2>



<p>The discoveries could guide the development of therapies to fix AT2 cells that are broken in disease. Drugs that target C/EBPα, for example, may restore repair programs or reduce scarring in pulmonary fibrosis.</p>



<p>"This research brings us closer to being able to boost the lung's natural repair mechanisms, offering hope for preventing or reversing conditions where currently we can only slow progression," says Dr. Brownfield.</p>



<p>The findings may also guide earlier detection, helping clinicians identify when AT2 cells are stuck in one state and unable to regenerate. Such insights could lead to new biomarkers for lung disease. This work aligns with Mayo Clinic's Precure initiative, which focuses on detecting disease at its earliest stages — when interventions are most effective — and preventing progression before organ failure occurs.</p>



<p>At the same time, the research advances Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative, which aims to prevent organ failure and restore function through regenerative medicine. The team is now testing strategies to remove the repressive clamp on human AT2 cells, expand them in culture and potentially use them for cell replacement therapy.</p>

<p>"You're a match." <br><br>The words Brooke Harris was waiting for. Now, to share the news with her father-in-law.</p>



<p>Joe Harris had been on a kidney transplant waiting list since 2016. Worried about his age and ability to care for his wife, he was eager to find a match.</p>



<p>"I just was afraid that things were going to run out and I would get to a point that I could only be on dialysis, and then I wouldn't be, wouldn't be able to take care of her," says Joe.</p>



<p>Multiple setbacks in finding a kidney donor deeply affected Brooke.</p>

<p>"As soon as we found out and they told us that that second person didn't work, it was just this deep knowing in me that I need to test and find out. I didn't know why," she says.</p>



<p>And that test was a match.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/nguyen-michelle-c-m-d/bio-20520642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michelle Nguyen</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains how direct donation works.</p>



<p>"If you have a friend or a loved one who wants to donate a kidney to you, and you match them by blood type and by tissue typing, they can donate their kidney directly to you," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Not only would Joe get the organ he had been hoping for, but he'd also be the first patient at Mayo Clinic in Arizona to undergo&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robotic kidney transplantation</a>.</p>



<p>"I went, 'Good, let's do it.' I had no hesitancy about the robotic thing. The more I learned about it, the more I thought this is going to be kind of cool," Joe says.</p>



<p>"In patients who meet criteria to receive robotic kidney transplant, the goal is that it will provide improved outcomes for the patient — so smaller incisions, less pain, faster recovery, faster return to work or faster return to their day-to-day life," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Robotic kidney surgery doesn't replace the surgeon. Instead, it gives surgeons advanced tools to operate, as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/katariya-nitin-n-m-d/bio-20517065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nitin Katariya</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains.</p>

<p>"It is a console that has four arms that can be placed near the bed and then a separate sort of console where you sit apart from the patient, where you can control the arms. And these arms articulate in ways you can control the camera, and you have multiple different instruments that you can switch out to navigate the anatomy and perform your operation," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Nguyen adds, "One important thing to note about robotic surgery, using this platform, is that at no point in time is the robot making any movements without the surgeons maneuvering the instruments."</p>



<p>For Brooke, she says the experience was easier than she thought.</p>



<p>"Honestly, even going back to the surgery, I have to say it's definitely not as scary as it seems. And recovery was a lot easier than I had anticipated," says Brooke.</p>



<p>And for Joe, his gratitude for his daughter-in-law's selfless donation is hard to put into words.</p>



<p>"How do you thank somebody for that? I don't know. It's so humbling. That's been hard for me, in a way, but I'm grateful. And she knows how I care about her," says Joe.</p>

<p>When Charnel Golis-Tabag picked up her sister from the airport in her home state of Hawaii, she didn't expect to hear that her sister's kidney function had dropped below 11%. That moment changed everything. "She told me she was on the transplant list," Charnel recalls. "Two days later, I called Mayo Clinic to start the living kidney donation process."</p>



<p>Charnel had seen too many family members endure the exhausting cycle of dialysis — three times a week, hours at a time. "They were tired, their veins were shot, they couldn't carry their grandchildren," she says. "I didn't want that for my sister."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The power of living donation</strong></h2>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/about/pac-20569323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donor kidneys</a> are great options for people waiting for a transplant," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jadlowiec-carrie-c-m-d/bio-20358001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Carrie Jadlowiec</a>, surgical director of Kidney Transplant at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. "They have a shorter waiting period, fewer complications, and the kidneys function longer than deceased donor kidneys."</p>



<p>For Charnel, knowing that her sister could live a longer, healthier life with a living kidney solidified her decision to donate. Despite her family's concerns for her own health, she was committed. "I believe we need to start with educating young Native Hawaiian people about living a healthier lifestyle," she says. "In our ohana community, we can reclaim our health," she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A donor chain of hope</strong></h2>



<p>For Michelle Gabriel, her younger sister's diagnosis was a turning point. "We asked each other, 'Can we do this? Will I be a match? What will it cost?' There were lots of questions and no answers at first," Michelle says.</p>



<p>She turned to Mayo Clinic, the National Kidney Foundation and the National Donate Life Registry. "These resources are fantastic and easily available online. Beyond online, our transplant coordinators walk patients through every step of the process," explains&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ty Diwan</a>, transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "We connect with patients from anywhere in the world via the portal and virtual appointments."</p>

<p>Michelle wasn't a match to her sister, but that didn't stop her. She joined a paired exchange program, creating a donor chain that benefited multiple families. No longer a question but a statement, "We can do this," became the sisters' ongoing mantra. "From that moment, we were all in. I saw the bigger picture: three people received kidneys that day," says Michelle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A husband's promise</strong></h2>



<p>For Albert Harris, June 20, 2024, is a date he'll never forget — it's the day he donated his kidney to his wife, making her "officially his other half," he jokes. "When she got sick, we got sick. I understood the marital vows, in sickness and in health. She's my partner in everything, and I look forward to having her around for a very long time."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bridging the gap</strong></h2>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant waiting lists</a>&amp;nbsp;come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color. This gap makes awareness and education critical — especially during Minority Living Donor Awareness Month, which highlights the need for diverse donors to help reduce disparities in transplant access.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a>&amp;nbsp;and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463">Dr. </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463"> Mao</a>, transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "It is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A shared legacy of hope</strong></h2>



<p>For Albert, Charnel and Michelle, living kidney donation was about more than surgery; it was about love, family and community. "It wasn't just a gift to my sister," Charnel says. "It was a gift to our entire family."</p>



<p>"You become someone's miracle," Michelle adds. "That person is someone's parent, sibling, friend. You give hope to everyone who loves them."</p>



<p>In most states,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a>&amp;nbsp;to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card.

<p>Living kidney donation is a&amp;nbsp;safe, medically supported procedure, with most donors resuming their lives within weeks.

<p><em>August is National Minority Donor Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Organ donation is a powerful act of generosity and compassion. It is one that can save lives, restore health and offer hope to those facing critical illness. While donation rates vary across different communities, there is a meaningful opportunity in underrepresented communities where donation rates remain disproportionately low. This presents an opportunity for people to help raise awareness and inspire others to consider this vital choice.</p>



<p>More than 106,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)</a>. Many come from diverse backgrounds, yet donor representation from these communities remains low. By learning about organ donation and choosing to register, whether as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living</a> or deceased donor, individuals can help strengthen awareness and directly support the health and well-being of their communities.</p>



<p>"Increasing diversity among organ donors is essential to improving equity in transplantation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/budhiraja-pooja-m-b-b-s/bio-20486288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pooja Budhiraja, M.B.B.S.</a>, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist. "Minority communities often face a higher risk of organ failure and longer wait times, yet they remain underrepresented among donors. Greater donor diversity can improve compatibility, shorten wait times and lead to better outcomes."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic experts share five reasons why expanding organ donor participation across all communities can make a life-saving difference.</p>



<p><strong>1. One donor can save up to eight lives.</strong><br>A single organ donor can save up to eight lives by donating organs such as kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas and intestines. In addition, donors can improve many more lives through tissue and eye donation, helping others regain mobility, sight, and healing after trauma or illness.</p>



<p><strong>2. Living donation is a safe and viable option.</strong><br>Living donation, such as donating one kidney or a portion of the liver, is a life-changing gift and a faster route to transplant for many. Kidney donation is the most common type of living-donor transplant. A healthy person can donate one of their two kidneys and continue living a full, active <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/about/pac-20569323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life</a>.</p>



<p>"Living donors undergo comprehensive health screens to ensure that donation is safe and will not negatively impact their long-term health," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen Mao, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. "Following donation, our living-donor heroes have gone on to bear children, climb mountains and complete marathons."</p>



<p><strong>3. Age isn't a barrier to organ donation.</strong><br>There is no upper age limit for organ, eye or tissue donation. While you must be at least 18 to register in most states, eligibility is based on medical condition at the time of donation, not age alone. Older adults — including those in their 70s or beyond — have successfully donated organs and tissues.</p>



<p><strong>4. Underrepresented populations are more likely to need a transplant.</strong><br>Conditions that can lead to organ failure — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease — are more common in African American, Latino, Asian American and Native American communities. According to the <a href="https://www.kidney.org/take-action/advocate/legislative-priorities/health-disparities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Foundation</a>, kidney disease disproportionately affects underrepresented communities.</p>



<p>"Patients in minority groups face many challenges in accessing transplantation, either for donation or as a potential transplant recipient," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ty Diwan, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. "Bringing awareness of the prospect of donation to specific groups will not only help save lives overall, but continue to foster conversations on how to improve access for patients in these specific populations."</p>



<p><strong>5. A better match can lead to better outcomes.</strong><br>Organs aren't matched by race or ethnicity, but blood types and tissue markers tend to be more compatible among people with shared ancestry. That means recipients may have better outcomes when the donor comes from a similar background.</p>



<p>"Registering as a donor is a simple, powerful act that can change — and even save — multiple lives. I encourage everyone to learn about donation, talk with their families, and take that step to offer hope and healing," says Dr. Budhiraja.</p>

<p>In the U.S., about <a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/fast-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17 people</a> die every day while waiting for an organ transplant.</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a> and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says Dr. Mao. "So it is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more organ failures.</p>



<p>"The more people we can help the sooner through transplant, the better," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living donors do not experience a change in their quality of life after surgery, but a recipient's life can change for the better almost immediately.</p>



<p>"If somebody is approved to be a <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donor</a>, we expect they will live a full and normal life following their donation process," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>In most states, <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a> to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card. For a <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.org/for-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donation</a>, contact the recipient's care team or a <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center</a> for more information.</p>

<p>This was a day Ava had been looking forward to after a long journey with heart failure, two lifesaving <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ecmo/about/pac-20484615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)</a> therapies, a heart transplant, kidney failure and a kidney transplant.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Born with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)</a>, a life-threatening condition where the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped, Ava faced three open-heart surgeries before she would reach her 5th birthday. Within 90 minutes of her birth, her first surgery was performed. Her second surgery was completed months later, but the third, typically required for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-qa-podcast-hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLHS</a> patients between the ages of 3 and 4, was not possible due to other medical concerns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For a handful of years, Ava's care team monitored her to see what her body would do. During that time, Ava felt good and was "defying the odds," as her mom, Christina DeShaw, would say.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>It was in 2021, during third grade, when Ava began to show signs of her heart and lungs struggling. While cardiac catheterization improved the blood flow to her lungs, it was a temporary improvement, and by early 2023, doctors determined a heart transplant was her only option.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Officially listed for a heart transplant in February 2023, Ava's condition worsened, leading to hospitalization at Mayo Clinic in September 2023. That hospital stay was the start of her long journey of constant monitoring and tests, and it wasn’t easy on her family as they navigated life split between Minnesota and Iowa.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ava's condition took a critical turn. Ava was placed on life-sustaining ECMO, which provides heart and lung support when those organs are failing. Then, Feb. 26, 2024, the call came: a donor heart became available. The surgery was successful, but postoperative challenges arose.</p>



<p>Weeks later, complications with her lungs led to a return to ECMO for three months. She also needed a tracheostomy placed. While trying to save her lungs, her kidney function began to fail, leading to another gift of life — a kidney transplant on Jan. 25, 2025, thanks to a donation from her uncle through a kidney exchange with the National Kidney Registry.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"She's a walking miracle," her mother says. "We can't even wrap our heads around what she's been through."</p>
