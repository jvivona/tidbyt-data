<p><em>April is Donate Life Month</em>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minnesota<strong> </strong>— The traditional way to treat people with advanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a> has been to use <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> to remove waste from the blood while patients wait several years for kidneys from deceased organ donors. At <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, transplant surgeon <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/prieto-mikel-m-d/bio-20053923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mikel Prieto</a> and colleagues advocate for a different approach called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/preemptive-kidney-transplant/pyc-20384830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preemptive transplantation</a>: Kidneys from living donors are allowing many people with advanced kidney disease to receive transplants before their kidneys deteriorate so much that they need dialysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chronic kidney disease afflicts roughly 1 in 10 people worldwide and causes millions of deaths each year, according to the <a href="https://www.theisn.org/initiatives/global-kidney-health-atlas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Society of Nephrology</a>. Kidneys filter waste and excess fluids from the blood that the body then expels in urine. Kidneys also help control <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/blood-pressure/art-20050982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>. In chronic kidney disease, kidneys gradually lose their effectiveness. Dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and waste can build up. Dialysis has traditionally been the next step.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dialysis removes waste and extra fluids from the blood, restores <a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/weight-management-1/newsfeed-post/whats-the-scoop-on-electrolyte-powders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrolyte</a> levels (helping muscles, the heart and the brain work well) and aids blood pressure control. Depending on the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dialysis-programs/overview/ovc-20464948" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type</a>, dialysis can take place at home or at a dialysis center. If the patient is a candidate for a kidney transplant, dialysis can be a bridge to transplant. Dialysis takes hours multiple times per week and often requires significant lifestyle changes and dietary restrictions. Dialysis may occur for years if a patient is waiting for a kidney from a deceased donor.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dialysis extends life but unfortunately it often doesn't yield great quality of life, explains Dr. Prieto, who performs pediatric and adult kidney transplants and is surgical director of the pediatric kidney transplant program at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"People on dialysis may feel kind of lousy for the most part. Although some manage to stay working and engaged in their other activities, a small percentage of patients on dialysis have a full, normal life," Dr. Prieto says. "Second, your body deteriorates because even though dialysis keeps you alive, it does not do a fantastic job at cleaning out all the waste. So, if someone is on dialysis for seven years and you look at their arteries, they may be a 40-year-old, but their arteries and blood vessels look like a 70- or 80-year-old. You want to minimize the amount of dialysis if you can."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That is where living kidney donors come in. A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living kidney donor</a> is someone who donates a healthy kidney on behalf of a family member, friend or even a stranger. If the living donor's kidney isn't a direct match for an intended recipient, it can become part of a paired donor chain. The incompatible donor's kidney goes to someone who is a match, and the donor's intended recipient receives a kidney from a different and compatible donor. Donor chains can include several donor-recipient pairs.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Typically, unless you are really hard to match, we'll find a matching kidney for you within weeks or two to three months," Dr. Prieto says. "When you come for a transplant evaluation, we will ask whether you have or could have a living donor. If you don't, we will explain how to find one."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There are other potential advantages to donor chains: The living donor and the kidney recipient, frequently spouses or close relatives, can be each other's caregivers after surgery. Participation in separate donor-transplant chains can ensure that their surgeries do not occur at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota have extensive experience with living donor kidney transplants and living donor chains. At Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, roughly half of the patients who receive kidney transplants get them from living donors before their kidneys decline so much that they need dialysis, Dr. Prieto says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Most people know for years in advance that they are going to need dialysis at some point, or a transplant," he explains. "It's much better to plan for a transplant now because waiting times for a deceased donor can be years. During that waiting time, your kidney function keeps deteriorating."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients typically become candidates for a kidney transplant when their kidney function drops below 20%. Dialysis usually starts when function reaches around 10%. If you start thinking about transplantation at this time, it is often too late, and you will be on dialysis awhile, Dr. Prieto says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"So that's the sweet spot: transplant between 20% and 10% of kidney function. That's what we call preemptive transplantation," Dr. Prieto says. "That's what we try to do here at Mayo. If we time things right, we can do the transplant and avoid dialysis altogether."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Prieto and Mayo Clinic are early adopters of living kidney donation, paired donation and donor chains. In the U.S., the <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Registry</a> facilitates living kidney donation and donor chains. Mayo Clinic is a member institution and Dr. Prieto serves on the registry's medical advisory board.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Many of the patients Dr. Prieto treats have <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease-early-intervention-and-lifestyle-crucial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autosomal dominant</a> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic kidney disease</a>, an inherited condition in which clusters of cysts grow and substantially enlarge kidneys, potentially causing kidney failure. Symptoms often appear in middle age. In the conventional approach, such patients would have their kidneys removed, go on dialysis, and then months or years later have a kidney transplant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Prieto has perfected a technique that spares people with polycystic kidney disease multiple visits to the operating room. He removes the enlarged kidneys laparoscopically, a minimally invasive approach that prevents a large incision. Then, in the same operation, using a kidney usually from a living donor, he gives the patient a new kidney.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"In many cases of polycystic kidney disease, the kidneys are so big that it's very uncomfortable," Dr. Prieto says. "People cannot tie their shoes. They cannot bend over. They eat and feel full very quickly. Even breathing sometimes can be difficult. Also, their kidneys can bleed chronically, so patients are hospitalized with severe pain, bleeding or infection."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>He and his colleagues are now embarking on another new frontier: They seek to give patients kidneys that are such a perfect match that their bodies are much less likely to reject them, diminishing the need to take a high dose of <a href="https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/transplant/newsfeed-post/immunosuppression-watching-for-and-managing-side-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immune system-suppressing drugs</a>.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We want to give patients kidneys they will never reject," Dr. Prieto says.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Hailing from the historic town of Natchitoches, Louisiana, Roderick Baptiste has spent the last 17 years in Columbus, Georgia. His journey, marked by unexpected health challenges, began to unfold when he moved to Georgia in 2008. During a routine visit to his local primary care physician, an underlying heart issue and high blood pressure were discovered. This led to a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">congestive heart failure</a> and stage 3 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney failure</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The path to Mayo Clinic</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-and-Ronita-Baptiste1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402160" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-and-Ronita-Baptiste1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-and-Ronita-Baptiste1-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-and-Ronita-Baptiste1-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-and-Ronita-Baptiste1-1x1-1.jpg 810w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roderick and Ronita Baptiste</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For several years, Roderick made efforts to manage his condition. "I was treated and was being sustained with changes in medications and many prayers," says Roderick. "In August of 2014, my cardiologist referred me to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, and this began my Mayo Clinic experience." At that time, his heart function had declined to a mere 10% ejection fraction, a measurement of the heart’s ability to pump oxygen-rich blood to the body.</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The waiting game</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-Baptiste-in-hospital-bed-with-heart-pillow-1x1-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Roderick Baptiste in the hospital following his transplant" class="wp-image-402157" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-Baptiste-in-hospital-bed-with-heart-pillow-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-Baptiste-in-hospital-bed-with-heart-pillow-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-Baptiste-in-hospital-bed-with-heart-pillow-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-Baptiste-in-hospital-bed-with-heart-pillow-1x1-1-768x769.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Roderick-Baptiste-in-hospital-bed-with-heart-pillow-1x1-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Roderick Baptiste in the hospital following his transplant</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Life took a slower pace in 2014 as daily activities became increasingly challenging. "Walking, talking, and normal, day-to-day routines slowly became more and more difficult to manage on my own," says Roderick. By August 2019, he had entered total kidney failure and required dialysis. Despite being listed for a heart and kidney transplant in December 2014, the wait extended for five long years, filled with monthly travels to Mayo Clinic for testing and assessments. Spring of 2019 brought multiple hospital admissions, and by December, his health had significantly deteriorated. In January 2020, Mayo Clinic admitted Roderick as an inpatient until a transplant could be performed. After a 23-day wait, he received a new heart and kidney on Feb. 22, 2020.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A connection beyond surgery</strong></h2>



<p>Six months after his transplant, Roderick reached out to his donor's family. His donor's mother responded, and since then, they have built a strong relationship, maintaining contact through visits, phone calls, texts and video conferencing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Living his best life</strong> </h2>



<p>Today, Roderick says he feels amazing, living his best life with no health issues to report. His story is a testament to the lifesaving effect of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-become-an-organ-donor-and-save-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">organ donation</a> and transplantation.

<p>Imagine if your one life could help save the lives of many. Organ donation has the power to transform a single act into the gift of life for countless people in need.</p>



<p>"This tremendous gift of organ donation can make a new life possible for patients who are waiting for transplant, and there is a critical shortage of available donor organs," says Dr. Heimbach.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">The need for living organ donors</h2>



<p>As the need for kidneys and livers grows, living donation is becoming an increasingly important option for patients waiting for a transplant.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/kidney-transplant-living-donor.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of living kidney donation" class="wp-image-223197" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/kidney-transplant-living-donor.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/kidney-transplant-living-donor-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration of living kidney donation</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"The primary benefit of living donor transplant is to be able to go ahead to transplant sooner, so patients don't continue to wait on the list, become more sick, have a risk of dying on the list," she says.</p>



<p>Whether you consider being a living or a deceased donor, it's important to ask questions and plan ahead.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's very important to make your wishes known, talk it through with your family and recognize that all of this is possible because of this remarkable altruism," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>



<p>If you want to be an organ donor, you can sign up for your state's donor registry, mark your choice on your driver's license when you get or renew it, and make sure your family knows you want to be an organ donor.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When it's time for a lung transplant</strong></h2>



<p>A lung transplant is typically&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/news/lung-transplantation-when-to-refer/mac-20575853" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">considered</a>&amp;nbsp;when a patient's disease severely impacts day-to-day functioning and/or threatens survival.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“About 30% to 40% of those who need a lung transplant have late-stage chronic&amp;nbsp;obstructive pulmonary disease and need quality-of-life care,” Dr. Baz says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/COPD-16x9-.jpg" alt="medical illustration of COPD" class="wp-image-220354" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/COPD-16x9-.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/10/COPD-16x9--300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>Lung transplantation for patients with pulmonary fibrosis, emphysema or COPD can greatly improve overall health. For many, a transplant reduces dependence on oxygen, helping them live more active and independent lives.</p>



<p>"We feel that their quality of life will improve significantly after the transplant. Because they're no longer on oxygen, they can be out and about, walk farther, go on vacations and improve their survival," says Dr. Baz. "There's a subpopulation, especially for fibrosis; we think we can add several years to their survival.”</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancements in lung transplantation</strong></h2>



<p>Medical innovation has dramatically evolved the lung transplant process, making transplants safer and more effective for patients. One of the most significant advances is a system that tests and preserves donated lungs.</p>



<p>"We have something called&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/news/organ-perfusion-systems-a-boon-to-heart-and-lung-transplants/mac-20518585?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ex vivo lung perfusion, or EVLP</a>. It's where we put the donated lungs on a breathing machine, circulate fluid in them, test them for about three to four hours and ensure they are good lungs," Dr. Baz explains.</p>



<p>This method ensures donated lungs are viable for transplantation, significantly boosting the availability of usable organs.&amp;nbsp;It means shorter wait times and more opportunities to find suitable donors.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Improved care</strong></h2>



<p>Thanks to improved personalized patient care, rehabilitation, infection management and rejection treatment advancements, both short-term and long-term survival rates for lung transplants have improved significantly.<br><br>Transplant, says Dr. Baz, can be life-transforming. "It will take patients from being dependent on oxygen, dependent physically, to independent of oxygen and an independent lifestyle. And it can do that often within a few weeks after transplant surgery."</p>



<p>It's important to note that a lung transplant isn't right for everyone. Many factors determine eligibility, so working closely with your care team to evaluate the best treatment option is important.</p>

<p>The liver is the largest internal organ of the body. It is essential for metabolism, digesting food and ridding the body of toxic substances. Liver failure can happen quickly, or over time.</p>



<p>"Once liver disease advances, the only way we can reverse the process and give the patient their life back is by replacing the liver, " says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>When patients become a candidate for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">liver transplant</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank">,</a> they are added to a waitlist. Unfortunately, there are more people waiting for a liver than there are available organs.</p>



<p>"As the patient is waiting on the list, they usually are anxiously waiting for that call when a donor becomes available. And that's what we call the deceased donor liver transplantation."</p>



<p>Another option is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">living liver transplant</a>. It's a major surgery where a person donates two-thirds of his or her liver. Donors needs to go through an extensive evaluation to make sure they can donate safely.</p>



<p>"A healthy liver is able to regenerate, and you will be surprised to know that with living donor liver transplantation, both segments of the liver will grow back to almost the normal size within 90 days after transplantation."</p>



<p>Being a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/living-donor-transplantation-evaluation/gnc-20505893?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/living-donor-transplantation-evaluation/gnc-20505893?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living organ donor</a> may not be an option for everyone, but there are ways to people can sign up to be an organ donor. It can be as easy as checking a box on your driver's license.</p>



<p>"Donating your organs is really donating the gift of life to people who are in urgent need for organ transplantation," Dr. Aqel says.</p>

<p>April is National Donate Life Month. You may have seen or heard stories about transplant chains, also known as paired donations. This is when a living donor is not a match for a specific recipient but still agrees to donate, setting off a chain reaction of transplants. Most of these paired donations involve the kidney. Because most people have two kidneys and usually can get by with one just fine, donating the other is an option. Far less common is a paired liver transplant.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But you might be asking yourself, if a person only has one liver, how can you be a living donor to start this chain?</p>



<p>The liver is the largest internal organ in the body. Among its jobs is helping to digest food and getting rid of waste. Unfortunately, disease and other factors can lead to liver failure.</p>



<p><strong><a href="//youtu.be/DOu9IuNkObw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: Liver’s regenerative ability allows for living donors</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Paired-Liver-transplant_CLEAN.mp4"></video></figure>

Read the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Paired-Liver-Transplant.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong></p>



<p>"At any given time, there's about 10,000 people waiting for a liver transplant in this country, and every year, we add another 10,000 to the waiting list," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-timucin-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055648?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Timucin Taner</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. He adds that it can be a frustrating situation.</p>



<p>"The waiting list is not changing, because we're able to transplant only about 10,000 of them with deceased donor livers," he says.</p>



<p>What can make a difference is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-liver-transplant/pyc-20384846?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donors</a>. Even though you only have one liver, Dr. Taner says you can still be a living donor. "And this is all based on the liver's amazing ability to regenerate. Once you do this operation, you remove part of the liver. The remaining liver, as well as the part that goes to the recipient, starts growing right away, and it becomes a full-size liver within about three to four weeks. So it's an amazing capacity of the liver," he says.</p>



<p>Not every donor is going to be a compatible match for an intended recipient. That's where <a href="https://unos.org/transplant/liver-paired-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paired donation</a> comes in, explains Dr. Taner. "So there are several situations where the donor may not be suitable or compatible with the intended recipient. In that situation, if they're clear to donate, then they can donate to somebody else who is compatible to them, and that recipient's donor can donate to the initial recipient. So we're just allowing these donors to give the gift that they're intended to give," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Taner led the team that completed Mayo's first paired liver transplant in August. It was initiated by an altruistic donor. Dr. Taner says paired liver transplants are not as common as paired kidney transplants, in part because of the logistics involved. "You have to have a big team, and this big team includes nurse coordinators who work day in and day out with donors and recipients, the social work and independent liver donor advocate team, as well as the physicians, the surgeons," he says.</p>



<p>While the hope is to be able to do more of these procedures, Dr. Taner says the biggest hurdle is the number of donors. "So I would encourage people to look into the transplant programs to see if they can donate, and make a decision based on that information," he says.</p>

<p>Learning you have advanced colorectal cancer that has spread to the liver can be scary. In some cases, a liver transplant may offer hope, providing better outcomes when other treatments aren't an option.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"In those circumstances where patients have colon cancer that's gone to the liver that doesn't seem to be anyplace else within the body, but they're not eligible for consideration of doing a surgical resection — in those circumstances, we can consider replacing the entire liver, and that involves a liver transplant," explains Dr. Harnois.</p>



<p>It's a complex surgery requiring experts from multiple teams working together.</p>



<p>"We're working together as a team to make sure we are offering the best options for the potential for cure for these patients," she says.</p>



<p>Liver transplants have greatly improved survival rates. One-year survival is 80% to 100%, three-year survival is around 80%, and five-year survival is between 60% and 80%.</p>



<p>"Without consideration of liver transplant, their five-year survival rate would have been 15%. So we can offer a dramatic improvement in survival rates in patients that undergo liver transplant," says Dr. Harnois.</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Liver transplants are becoming a new treatment option for certain colorectal cancer patients whose cancer has spread to their liver and are ineligible for other surgical options. This innovative approach is providing hope to colorectal cancer patients who otherwise are often faced with a grim prognosis.</p>



<p>"Colorectal cancer is the fourth-most-common cancer in the United States, but it's also the second-deadliest cancer. At the time of diagnosis, about 1 in 5 patients will have metastatic disease, meaning the cancer has spread outside of the colon. The most common place we see metastasis is in the liver," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/harnois-denise-m-d-o/bio-20054316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Denise Harnois, D.O.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant hepatologist.</p>



<p>In roughly a quarter of these cases, the cancer does not spread beyond the liver. Traditionally, surgeons first explore the option of cutting out the cancer in the liver. However, if the cancer has spread to more than one area of the liver, this approach may not be an option. That is when a liver transplant can be considered for patients who meet certain criteria, Dr. Harnois says.</p>



<p>The ideal candidate will have responded well to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>, and the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colorectal cancer</a> will not have spread beyond the liver. They are also not a candidate for surgical removal of the cancer in their liver. Patients also need to be healthy enough to undergo a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a>. This new approach is critical for these patients, whose five-year survival rate without a transplant is only about 15%.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is one of very few transplant centers in the U.S. performing liver transplants on patients with colorectal cancer metastasis, in part because it's a relatively new treatment option. It also requires a multidisciplinary team of oncologists, surgeons and transplant experts who work closely together to help these patients," Dr. Harnois says.</p>



<p>Gary Gonzales is among those grateful this new option exists. The 59-year-old from Broomfield, Colorado, was diagnosed with colorectal cancer at age 52. The cancer soon spread to his liver. He was referred to Mayo Clinic after having undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and two liver resection surgeries at another institution. He had a liver transplant at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20203899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in July of 2024, and says he finally feels like his old self. He is thankful for his care team and his liver donor.</p>



<p>"I am very grateful for that donor," Gary says. "I would definitely like to give the donor's family a hug. The donor is a part of me and my family and gave me a chance to live."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — More than 90,000 people are on the waiting list for a kidney in the U.S. Unfortunately, less than a third of those waiting for a kidney transplant can expect to get one this year. This comes as rates of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>, which can lead to kidney failure, continue to climb across the globe. But there is a way to help. Healthy people can <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donate one of their kidneys</a>, giving someone a much-needed second chance.</p>



<p>"For people with kidney failure, receiving a kidney from a living donor is the best possible option. When healthy people donate a kidney, they give someone a second chance. This helps kidney recipients get transplanted faster and enjoy a healthier life," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jadlowiec-carrie-c-m-d/bio-20358001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Jadlowiec, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>



<p>There were more than 6,400 living kidney donations in 2024. And while the number has increased in recent years, it is still less than it was five years ago. Ahead of <a href="https://www.worldkidneyday.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Kidney Day</a> on March 13, Mayo Clinic experts are helping dispel some of the most common myths surrounding living kidney donation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Myth: Living kidney donors need to be in perfect health.</strong></h2>



<p><strong>False. </strong>While it is important for kidney donors to generally be in good health, there is no expectation that donors be in perfect health. For example, some potential donors with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/transplant-medicine/news/individuals-with-controlled-hypertension-can-safely-donate-a-kidney/mac-20514360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controlled high blood pressure</a> or <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/type-2-diabetes-no-longer-a-barrier-to-becoming-a-living-kidney-donor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2 diabetes</a> are eligible to be donors. All potential donors need to be at least 18 and undergo a rigorous medical and psychological evaluation to make sure they are a good candidate to donate. At Mayo Clinic, those evaluations can be completed in a single day.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Myth: Anyone over age 50 can't be a living donor.</strong></h2>



<p><strong>False.</strong> Plenty of people over 50 are living donors.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>"We accept donors starting at age 18. There is no upper age limit for someone to be a kidney donor. We do a comprehensive assessment on all potential donors, regardless of their age, to make sure they are an appropriate candidate," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ty Diwan, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Myth: You must be related to someone to be a match.</strong></h2>



<p><strong>False.</strong> Anyone can be a living kidney donor. You can consider donating a kidney to a relative, friend, acquaintance or anonymously to someone on the waiting list. Sometimes a potential donor who wants to give to a family member or a friend isn't an optimal match for that recipient. In those situations, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/paired-donation/overview/ovc-20508454#:~:text=For%20paired%20donation%2C%20donors%20and,may%20consider%20a%20paired%20donation." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paired donation</a> is considered. Donors and recipients are matched with other donors and recipients, creating what is known as a kidney chain. People without a specific recipient in mind can also choose to donate to a stranger via <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/nondirected-living-donor/pyc-20384850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nondirected donation</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Myth: Kidney donors can't live an active lifestyle after donation.</strong></h2>



<p><strong>False.</strong> In most cases, kidney donors can return to normal activities four to six weeks after surgery. Most donors undergo a laparoscopic procedure that involves making a few small incisions instead of a larger one. In some cases, minimally robotic surgery is also an option. Both types of surgery reduce recovery time. Many donors return to their pre-donation hobbies such as running, biking and swimming. As with any surgery, there are risks, and it is important for potential donors to discuss those with their healthcare team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Myth: Donating a kidney shortens your lifespan.</strong></h2>



<p><strong>False.</strong> <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.com/for-donors/kidney-donation-blog/does-donating-a-kidney-shorten-your-life/#:~:text=Second%2C%20living%20kidney%20donors%20tend%20to%20take,health%20and%20the%20importance%20of%20healthy%20habits." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Multiple studies</a> have shown that donating a kidney does not shorten one's lifespan. In fact, kidney donors tend to live longer than the general population.</p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>"Kidney donors undergo rigorous screening prior to donation, and those accepted as donors are often healthier than the general population at baseline. These individuals often continue to live healthy lifestyles post-donation, which can lead to a longer lifespan," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen Mao, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"As long as you're healthy and have good kidney function, then you could potentially qualify to be a kidney donor," says Dr. Jadlowiec.<br><br>It starts with a thorough medical evaluation.</p>



<p>"That gives us a good sense of where we're starting, and then it also allows us to better predict where will your kidney function be at in five years and 10 years after you donate," she says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risks </h2>



<p>Both surgical and medical risks are low, thanks to advanced technology.</p>



<p>"For all kidney donors, that risk is less than 1%, which is what we see within the general population," says Dr. Jadlowiec.</p>



<p>It's a minimally invasive surgery. "Meaning that we do it through small incisions, which helps with faster recovery," she says.</p>



<p>Full recovery can take up to six weeks, but many people start feeling better around three weeks after surgery.</p>



<p>"The biggest benefit is the ability to help someone and to really change their life," Dr. Jadlowiec says.</p>
