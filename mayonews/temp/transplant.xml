<p>PHOENIX&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;researchers have developed a pioneering method to mend damaged hearts without open-heart surgery, an advance that could one day transform the treatment of heart failure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new approach uses lab-grown heart tissue made from reprogrammed adult stem cells, delivered through a tiny incision rather than a surgically opened chest cavity. In preclinical testing, the stem cell patch restored heart function and improved healing.</p>

<p>"For patients with severe heart failure, there are very few options beyond mechanical pumps or transplants. We hope this approach will offer a new way to repair their own hearts," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zhu-wuqiang-m-d-ph-d/bio-20465805" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuqiang Zhu, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S174270612500649X?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;published in Acta Biomaterialia and a cardiovascular researcher at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reversing the irreversible</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heart attacks</a> remain one of the leading causes of death worldwide. When blood flow to the heart is blocked, oxygen-starved cells die and are replaced by scar tissue that cannot contract or conduct electrical signals — weakening the heart’s ability to pump blood.</p>



<p>"The adult human heart doesn't regenerate once those cells are lost," Dr. Zhu explains. "That's why heart failure, especially chronic heart failure due to the loss of functional cardiac muscle, is often difficult to treat; the muscle simply can't repair itself."</p>



<p>For years, scientists have been working on ways to replace damaged tissue with healthy heart cells derived from stem cells. Early efforts showed promise, but most required open-heart surgery<a>&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;</a>a procedure too risky for many patients already struggling with severe&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-failure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart failure</a>.</p>



<p>Scientists have long hoped that stem cells could provide a way to rebuild what the body cannot. By reprogramming ordinary adult cells such as skin or blood cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), researchers can coax them into becoming replacement heart cells.</p>



<p>But safely and effectively delivering engineered heart tissues made from these cells has remained a major challenge.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Innovation at heart</strong></h2>



<p>In collaboration with engineers at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Mayo researchers developed a flexible, paper-thin patch made of nano- and microfibers coated with gelatin. This hybrid scaffold supports a blend of human heart muscle cells, blood vessel cells and fibroblasts—cells that form the tissue’s structural framework—to create a living, beating piece of heart tissue. Before transplantation, the tissue is infused with bioactive factors such as fibroblast growth factor 1 and CHIR99021 that encourage the growth of new blood vessels and help the cells survive once they are in place.</p>



<p>"The beauty of this design," says Dr. Zhu, "is that it can be folded like a piece of paper, loaded into a slender tube, and delivered precisely where it's needed through a small incision in the chest. Once in place, it unfolds and adheres naturally to the heart's surface."</p>



<p>Instead of using stitches, the team used a biocompatible surgical adhesive that holds the patch in place while minimizing additional trauma to the surrounding tissue.</p>



<p>Testing in preclinical models showed that the minimally invasive method improved heart function, reduced scarring, enhanced vascular growth and lessened inflammation compared with conventional approaches.</p>



<p>"Our results show that these engineered tissues not only survive but actually help the heart heal itself," says Dr. Zhu. "That's the ultimate goal: to replace what's lost and restore function."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A step toward regeneration</strong></h2>



<p>The research aligns closely with Mayo Clinic's Genesis Initiative, which aims to accelerate discoveries that restore or regenerate human organs and tissues.</p>



<p>"Genesis is about pioneering new ways to repair and rebuild the human body," Dr. Zhu says. "What we're doing here is exactly that — using regenerative science and minimally invasive delivery to give the heart a chance to recover."</p>



<p>Currently, more than 4,000 <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/heart-transplant/about/pac-20384750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart transplants</a> are performed in the United States each year, while thousands more patients die waiting for a donor organ. Dr. Zhu hopes this technology could eventually offer another option.</p>



<p>"Our vision," he says, "is that patients could one day receive engineered heart tissue made from their own reprogrammed cells, delivered through a minimally invasive procedure — no donor organ, no long recovery, just a repaired heart."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong></h2>



<p>The Mayo Clinic team plans to advance this work through larger-scale preclinical testing to ensure the therapy's safety and effectiveness before moving to human clinical trials, a process that Dr. Zhu estimates could take five years or more.</p>



<p>"Heart failure remains a devastating condition," he says. "If we can make stem cell treatment accessible to more patients, especially those too fragile for open-heart surgery, we could save lives."</p>

<p>"Every transplant represents the work of an extraordinary team dedicated to restoring hope and health," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/taner-c-burcin-m-d/bio-20054935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Burcin Taner</a>,&amp;nbsp;chair of the Department of Transplantation at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "Reaching this milestone reflects our clinical excellence and the trust our patients place in Mayo Clinic. Together, we're shaping the next era of transplantation — one defined by innovation, collaboration and compassion."</p>



<p>The Florida Transplant Program began as a liver transplant program. Kidney transplant was added in 2000, followed by heart and lung transplants in 2001. The transplant program reports some of the highest survival rates, the lowest median wait times and the highest volumes in the country, according to the <a href="https://www.srtr.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients</a>.</p>



<p>The 10,000th transplant places the program among the top transplant centers nationwide for overall transplant volume. Additionally, the transplant center is on track for a record volume year, having performed more than 465 procedures by Oct. 29.</p>



<p>Nationally, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Transplant Center</a>, which offers transplant services at its campuses in Arizona, Florida and Minnesota, is a leader in treating patients with heart disease. Combined volumes rank Mayo Clinic first among all adult transplant centers in the nation.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic physicians have experience treating patients with complex conditions who may need <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/multiorgan-transplants/gnc-20203913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiorgan transplants</a>, including heart-lung, kidney-pancreas, heart-lung-liver transplants and more.</p>



<p>"Every transplant tells a story of teamwork, trust and commitment," Dr. Taner says. "The growing volume of transplants at Mayo Clinic is the ultimate testament that our patients value our expertise and sense the dedication behind our care."</p>

<p>When a person's lungs are damaged, that organ's survival depends on a small but powerful set of cells that must choose whether to repair the tissue or fight infection. A new Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64224-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> has uncovered the molecular "switch" that directs these cells down one path or the other, a discovery that could inform regenerative therapies for chronic lung diseases.</p>

<p>"We were surprised to find that these specialized cells cannot do both jobs at once," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brownfield-douglas-g-ph-d/bio-20522531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.,</a> senior author of the study, which was published in Nature Communications. "Some commit to rebuilding, while others focus on defense. That division of labor is essential — and by uncovering the switch that controls it, we can start thinking about how to restore balance when it breaks down in disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It takes two</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The new research centers on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which play a dual role in the lung. These cube-shaped cells secrete surfactant proteins that keep air sacs open, but they also act as reserve stem cells capable of regenerating alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells — the paper-thin cells that form the surface for gas exchange. This regenerative capacity makes AT2 cells essential for lung repair after injury.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists have known that these cells often fail to regenerate properly in lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe viral infections like COVID-19. What remained unclear was how AT2 cells lose their stem cell capacity.</p>



<p>Using single-cell sequencing, imaging and preclinical injury models, the team mapped the developmental "life history" of AT2 cells. They found that newly formed AT2 cells stay flexible for about one to two weeks after birth before "locking in" to their specialized identity.</p>



<p>That timing is controlled by a molecular circuit involving three key regulators called PRC2, C/EBPα, and DLK1. The researchers showed that one of them, C/EBPα, acts like a clamp that suppresses stem cell activity. In adult lungs, AT2 cells must release this clamp after injury to regenerate.</p>



<p>The same molecular switch also directs whether AT2 cells repair lung tissue or defend against infection. That helps explain why infections often slow recovery from lung disease.</p>



<p>"When we think about lung repair, it's not just about turning things on — it's about removing the clamps that normally keep these cells from acting like stem cells," says Dr. Brownfield. "We discovered one of those clamps and how it times the ability of these cells to repair."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing organ failure</strong></h2>



<p>The discoveries could guide the development of therapies to fix AT2 cells that are broken in disease. Drugs that target C/EBPα, for example, may restore repair programs or reduce scarring in pulmonary fibrosis.</p>



<p>"This research brings us closer to being able to boost the lung's natural repair mechanisms, offering hope for preventing or reversing conditions where currently we can only slow progression," says Dr. Brownfield.</p>



<p>The findings may also guide earlier detection, helping clinicians identify when AT2 cells are stuck in one state and unable to regenerate. Such insights could lead to new biomarkers for lung disease. This work aligns with Mayo Clinic's Precure initiative, which focuses on detecting disease at its earliest stages — when interventions are most effective — and preventing progression before organ failure occurs.</p>



<p>At the same time, the research advances Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative, which aims to prevent organ failure and restore function through regenerative medicine. The team is now testing strategies to remove the repressive clamp on human AT2 cells, expand them in culture and potentially use them for cell replacement therapy.</p>

<p>"You're a match." <br><br>The words Brooke Harris was waiting for. Now, to share the news with her father-in-law.</p>



<p>Joe Harris had been on a kidney transplant waiting list since 2016. Worried about his age and ability to care for his wife, he was eager to find a match.</p>



<p>"I just was afraid that things were going to run out and I would get to a point that I could only be on dialysis, and then I wouldn't be, wouldn't be able to take care of her," says Joe.</p>



<p>Multiple setbacks in finding a kidney donor deeply affected Brooke.</p>

<p>"As soon as we found out and they told us that that second person didn't work, it was just this deep knowing in me that I need to test and find out. I didn't know why," she says.</p>



<p>And that test was a match.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/nguyen-michelle-c-m-d/bio-20520642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michelle Nguyen</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains how direct donation works.</p>



<p>"If you have a friend or a loved one who wants to donate a kidney to you, and you match them by blood type and by tissue typing, they can donate their kidney directly to you," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Not only would Joe get the organ he had been hoping for, but he'd also be the first patient at Mayo Clinic in Arizona to undergo&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeons-perform-first-robotic-assisted-kidney-transplant-in-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">robotic kidney transplantation</a>.</p>



<p>"I went, 'Good, let's do it.' I had no hesitancy about the robotic thing. The more I learned about it, the more I thought this is going to be kind of cool," Joe says.</p>



<p>"In patients who meet criteria to receive robotic kidney transplant, the goal is that it will provide improved outcomes for the patient — so smaller incisions, less pain, faster recovery, faster return to work or faster return to their day-to-day life," says Dr. Nguyen.</p>



<p>Robotic kidney surgery doesn't replace the surgeon. Instead, it gives surgeons advanced tools to operate, as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/katariya-nitin-n-m-d/bio-20517065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nitin Katariya</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon, explains.</p>

<p>"It is a console that has four arms that can be placed near the bed and then a separate sort of console where you sit apart from the patient, where you can control the arms. And these arms articulate in ways you can control the camera, and you have multiple different instruments that you can switch out to navigate the anatomy and perform your operation," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Nguyen adds, "One important thing to note about robotic surgery, using this platform, is that at no point in time is the robot making any movements without the surgeons maneuvering the instruments."</p>



<p>For Brooke, she says the experience was easier than she thought.</p>



<p>"Honestly, even going back to the surgery, I have to say it's definitely not as scary as it seems. And recovery was a lot easier than I had anticipated," says Brooke.</p>



<p>And for Joe, his gratitude for his daughter-in-law's selfless donation is hard to put into words.</p>



<p>"How do you thank somebody for that? I don't know. It's so humbling. That's been hard for me, in a way, but I'm grateful. And she knows how I care about her," says Joe.</p>

<p>When Charnel Golis-Tabag picked up her sister from the airport in her home state of Hawaii, she didn't expect to hear that her sister's kidney function had dropped below 11%. That moment changed everything. "She told me she was on the transplant list," Charnel recalls. "Two days later, I called Mayo Clinic to start the living kidney donation process."</p>



<p>Charnel had seen too many family members endure the exhausting cycle of dialysis — three times a week, hours at a time. "They were tired, their veins were shot, they couldn't carry their grandchildren," she says. "I didn't want that for my sister."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The power of living donation</strong></h2>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/about/pac-20569323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Living donor kidneys</a> are great options for people waiting for a transplant," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jadlowiec-carrie-c-m-d/bio-20358001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Carrie Jadlowiec</a>, surgical director of Kidney Transplant at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. "They have a shorter waiting period, fewer complications, and the kidneys function longer than deceased donor kidneys."</p>



<p>For Charnel, knowing that her sister could live a longer, healthier life with a living kidney solidified her decision to donate. Despite her family's concerns for her own health, she was committed. "I believe we need to start with educating young Native Hawaiian people about living a healthier lifestyle," she says. "In our ohana community, we can reclaim our health," she says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A donor chain of hope</strong></h2>



<p>For Michelle Gabriel, her younger sister's diagnosis was a turning point. "We asked each other, 'Can we do this? Will I be a match? What will it cost?' There were lots of questions and no answers at first," Michelle says.</p>



<p>She turned to Mayo Clinic, the National Kidney Foundation and the National Donate Life Registry. "These resources are fantastic and easily available online. Beyond online, our transplant coordinators walk patients through every step of the process," explains&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ty Diwan</a>, transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

<p>Michelle wasn't a match to her sister, but that didn't stop her. She joined a paired exchange program, creating a donor chain that benefited multiple families. No longer a question but a statement, "We can do this," became the sisters' ongoing mantra. "From that moment, we were all in. I saw the bigger picture: three people received kidneys that day," says Michelle.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A husband's promise</strong></h2>



<p>For Albert Harris, June 20, 2024, is a date he'll never forget — it's the day he donated his kidney to his wife, making her "officially his other half," he jokes. "When she got sick, we got sick. I understood the marital vows, in sickness and in health. She's my partner in everything, and I look forward to having her around for a very long time."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bridging the gap</strong></h2>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant waiting lists</a>&amp;nbsp;come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color. This gap makes awareness and education critical — especially during Minority Living Donor Awareness Month, which highlights the need for diverse donors to help reduce disparities in transplant access.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a>&amp;nbsp;and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463">Dr. </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463"> Mao</a>, transplant surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Florida. "It is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A shared legacy of hope</strong></h2>



<p>For Albert, Charnel and Michelle, living kidney donation was about more than surgery; it was about love, family and community. "It wasn't just a gift to my sister," Charnel says. "It was a gift to our entire family."</p>



<p>"You become someone's miracle," Michelle adds. "That person is someone's parent, sibling, friend. You give hope to everyone who loves them."</p>



<p>In most states,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a>&amp;nbsp;to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card.

<p><em>August is National Minority Donor Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Organ donation is a powerful act of generosity and compassion. It is one that can save lives, restore health and offer hope to those facing critical illness. While donation rates vary across different communities, there is a meaningful opportunity in underrepresented communities where donation rates remain disproportionately low. This presents an opportunity for people to help raise awareness and inspire others to consider this vital choice.</p>



<p>More than 106,000 people in the U.S. are waiting for a lifesaving organ transplant, according to the <a href="https://unos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)</a>. Many come from diverse backgrounds, yet donor representation from these communities remains low. By learning about organ donation and choosing to register, whether as a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/living-donor-transplantation/overview/ovc-20545462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living</a> or deceased donor, individuals can help strengthen awareness and directly support the health and well-being of their communities.</p>



<p>"Increasing diversity among organ donors is essential to improving equity in transplantation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/budhiraja-pooja-m-b-b-s/bio-20486288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pooja Budhiraja, M.B.B.S.</a>, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist. "Minority communities often face a higher risk of organ failure and longer wait times, yet they remain underrepresented among donors. Greater donor diversity can improve compatibility, shorten wait times and lead to better outcomes."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic experts share five reasons why expanding organ donor participation across all communities can make a life-saving difference.</p>



<p><strong>1. One donor can save up to eight lives.</strong><br>A single organ donor can save up to eight lives by donating organs such as kidneys, liver, heart, lungs, pancreas and intestines. In addition, donors can improve many more lives through tissue and eye donation, helping others regain mobility, sight, and healing after trauma or illness.</p>



<p><strong>2. Living donation is a safe and viable option.</strong><br>Living donation, such as donating one kidney or a portion of the liver, is a life-changing gift and a faster route to transplant for many. Kidney donation is the most common type of living-donor transplant. A healthy person can donate one of their two kidneys and continue living a full, active <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-kidney-transplant/about/pac-20569323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">life</a>.</p>



<p>"Living donors undergo comprehensive health screens to ensure that donation is safe and will not negatively impact their long-term health," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/mao-shennen-a-m-d/bio-20439463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shennen Mao, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. "Following donation, our living-donor heroes have gone on to bear children, climb mountains and complete marathons."</p>



<p><strong>3. Age isn't a barrier to organ donation.</strong><br>There is no upper age limit for organ, eye or tissue donation. While you must be at least 18 to register in most states, eligibility is based on medical condition at the time of donation, not age alone. Older adults — including those in their 70s or beyond — have successfully donated organs and tissues.</p>



<p><strong>4. Underrepresented populations are more likely to need a transplant.</strong><br>Conditions that can lead to organ failure — such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease — are more common in African American, Latino, Asian American and Native American communities. According to the <a href="https://www.kidney.org/take-action/advocate/legislative-priorities/health-disparities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Kidney Foundation</a>, kidney disease disproportionately affects underrepresented communities.</p>



<p>"Patients in minority groups face many challenges in accessing transplantation, either for donation or as a potential transplant recipient," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ty Diwan, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon. "Bringing awareness of the prospect of donation to specific groups will not only help save lives overall, but continue to foster conversations on how to improve access for patients in these specific populations."</p>



<p><strong>5. A better match can lead to better outcomes.</strong><br>Organs aren't matched by race or ethnicity, but blood types and tissue markers tend to be more compatible among people with shared ancestry. That means recipients may have better outcomes when the donor comes from a similar background.</p>



<p>"Registering as a donor is a simple, powerful act that can change — and even save — multiple lives. I encourage everyone to learn about donation, talk with their families, and take that step to offer hope and healing," says Dr. Budhiraja.</p>

<p>In the U.S., about <a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/fast-facts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17 people</a> die every day while waiting for an organ transplant.</p>



<p>Nearly 60% of people on <a href="https://minorityhealth.hhs.gov/omh/browse.aspx?lvl=4&amp;amp;lvlid=27#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2018.7%20percent%20of,percent%20of%20white%20living%20donors.">transplant waiting lists</a> come from minority communities, while about 30% of donors are people of color.</p>



<p>"<a href="https://www.life-source.org/latest/does-my-race-ethnicity-matter-in-organ-donation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blood types</a> and certain HLA, or antibodies, tend to correlate with various ethnic groups," says Dr. Mao. "So it is not directly related to a particular minority group; however, organs will end up with someone of a similar background because the better matched an organ is, the more longevity that organ has."</p>



<p>Higher rates of heart disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are present in minority communities, contributing to more organ failures.</p>



<p>"The more people we can help the sooner through transplant, the better," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>She says living donors do not experience a change in their quality of life after surgery, but a recipient's life can change for the better almost immediately.</p>



<p>"If somebody is approved to be a <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/learn/process/living-donation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donor</a>, we expect they will live a full and normal life following their donation process," says Dr. Mao.</p>



<p>In most states, <a href="https://www.organdonor.gov/sign-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signing up</a> to be a donor after death can be done online or when registering for a driver's license or identification card. For a <a href="https://www.kidneyregistry.org/for-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living donation</a>, contact the recipient's care team or a <a href="https://optn.transplant.hrsa.gov/about/search-membership/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant center</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Born with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350599" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)</a>, a life-threatening condition where the left side of the heart is severely underdeveloped, Ava faced three open-heart surgeries before she would reach her 5th birthday. Within 90 minutes of her birth, her first surgery was performed. Her second surgery was completed months later, but the third, typically required for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-qa-podcast-hypoplastic-left-heart-syndrome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLHS</a> patients between the ages of 3 and 4, was not possible due to other medical concerns.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For a handful of years, Ava's care team monitored her to see what her body would do. During that time, Ava felt good and was "defying the odds," as her mom, Christina DeShaw, would say.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>It was in 2021, during third grade, when Ava began to show signs of her heart and lungs struggling. While cardiac catheterization improved the blood flow to her lungs, it was a temporary improvement, and by early 2023, doctors determined a heart transplant was her only option.</p>

<p></p>



<p>Officially listed for a heart transplant in February 2023, Ava's condition worsened, leading to hospitalization at Mayo Clinic in September 2023. That hospital stay was the start of her long journey of constant monitoring and tests, and it wasn’t easy on her family as they navigated life split between Minnesota and Iowa.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In December 2023, Ava's condition took a critical turn. Ava was placed on life-sustaining ECMO, which provides heart and lung support when those organs are failing. Then, Feb. 26, 2024, the call came: a donor heart became available. The surgery was successful, but postoperative challenges arose.</p>



<p>Weeks later, complications with her lungs led to a return to ECMO for three months. She also needed a tracheostomy placed. While trying to save her lungs, her kidney function began to fail, leading to another gift of life — a kidney transplant on Jan. 25, 2025, thanks to a donation from her uncle through a kidney exchange with the National Kidney Registry.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"She's a walking miracle," her mother says. "We can't even wrap our heads around what she's been through."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — While immunosuppressive medications are critical to prevent rejection of transplant organs, they also come with plenty of downsides. They can cause harsh side effects, like headaches and tremors, and increase the risk for infection and cancer. But what if there was a way to prevent organ rejection without using these medications?</p>



<p>That goal fuels the work of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/stegall-mark-d-m-d/bio-00027542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Stegall, M.D.</a>, a longtime Mayo Clinic transplant researcher. He leads a team of researchers developing pioneering therapies to prevent organ rejection without the need for immunosuppression. A recently published study in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.amjtransplant.org/article/S1600-6135(25)00073-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Journal of Transplantation</a>&amp;nbsp;is offering hope for patients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Using stem cells to prevent organ rejection</strong></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic participated in the multisite phase 3 clinical trial detailed in the study. The goal was to see whether people who simultaneously received both a kidney and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/bone-marrow-transplant/home/orc-20212005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stem cell transplant</a>&amp;nbsp;from a closely matched sibling could discontinue all immunosuppressive medications after a year. The results were promising. The study found that 75% of participants were able to stop taking the medication for more than two years. At Mayo Clinic, three patients participated, with two off immunosuppression medications for over three years and one on a low dose.</p>



<p>"I've been involved in transplant research for more than 30 years, and we've done quite a few amazing things. But in the scheme of things, this research is right at the very top. It's been a goal — to be able to safely get transplant recipients off immunosuppression — for longer than I've been doing this. We're very excited about it," says Dr. Stegall, a co-author of the study.</p>



<p>The research being done across Mayo Clinic is part of a growing trend in transplant to explore ways to use cellular therapies to prevent organ rejection. It is also a cornerstone of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/transforming-transplant-initiative-aspires-to-save-lives-through-bioengineering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Transforming Transplant Initiative</a>, which has the bold goal of ensuring everyone who wants a transplant can get one and to make transplants more successful.</p>



<p>To qualify for the clinical trial, the transplant recipients and donors needed to be siblings whose tissue types closely matched. The donor agreed to donate their stem cells in addition to their kidney to their sibling. The recipient receives the transplant, undergoes radiation and then receives the stem cell transplant. The goal was to wean recipients off immunosuppression medication after a year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Almost like the transplant didn't happen'</strong></h2>



<p>For Minnesota native Mark Welter, the results have been better than he imagined. Four years ago, he needed a kidney transplant due to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polycystic kidney disease</a>, an inherited condition that causes cysts to grow on the kidneys. The Mayo Clinic patient volunteered to be a part of the clinical trial in hopes of not having to worry about immunosuppression medication the rest of his life. His younger sister Cindy Kendall immediately stepped forward to donate a kidney and her stem cells to help her brother.</p>



<p>"Being able to see him get off those medications has been amazing," Cindy says. "He just gets to live his life to the fullest. He has been able to see both of his daughters get married and meet his grandchildren."</p>

<p>Mark has not taken immunosuppression medication for more than three years.</p>



<p>"I feel fantastic. I actually feel like I did before the transplant, which has been the greatest thing," Mark says. "It's almost like the transplant didn't happen."</p>



<p>There is still plenty of work to be done to advance this research. This clinical trial only involved siblings with closely matching tissue types. Researchers want to know if stem cell transplants can prevent rejection in recipients paired with a less closely matched donor.</p>



<p>"Even in closely matched siblings, immunosuppression is needed lifelong. We have seen stopping medications even at eight to 10 years post-transplant leads to rejection. Our goal is to find ways to reduce or stop immunosuppressive medications after transplant so patients can have longer lasting kidneys with fewer side effects," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bentall-andrew-j-m-b-ch-b-m-d/bio-20340753" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Bentall, M.B., Ch.B., M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant nephrologist.</p>

<p>Curtis Jackson was living his dream life — a loving and supportive wife, three wonderful kids, and a future that looked as bright as could be.</p>



<p>Then, one day, without warning, the dream was shattered.</p>



<p>At only 46, Curtis was diagnosed with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408">cholangiocarcinoma</a>, one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of cancer. It's a silent killer that strikes the liver. It is often diagnosed in later stages, leaving patients with few treatment options and little time to live.</p>



<p>The Jackson family turned to Mayo Clinic, where a team of experts fought the cancer with a weapon rarely used in the battle against this aggressive form of cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Years before his cancer diagnosis, Curtis was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)</a>. PSC is a chronic liver disease that causes inflammation and scarring to the bile ducts, which work with the liver to help with digestion.</p>



<p>PSC put the Arizona man at higher risk for liver cancer, requiring him to get regular diagnostic screenings. As with most forms of cancer, but particularly cholangiocarcinoma, doctors say early detection is key to improving patient outcomes.</p>



<p>However, with cholangiocarcinoma, there are often no warning signs or symptoms alerting patients of the need to consult with their doctor about getting screened, until it's too late. In Curtis' case, the cholangiocarcinoma was detected in one of his routine screenings at Mayo Clinic, which doctors say likely helped save his life.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Kim-and-Curtis-Jackson-with-Dr.-Aqel-Bashar-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Curtis and Kim Jackson consulting with Dr. Aqel Bashar;cholangiocarcinoma,  a rare cancer led to a treatment at Mayo Clinic." class="wp-image-404534" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Kim-and-Curtis-Jackson-with-Dr.-Aqel-Bashar-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Kim-and-Curtis-Jackson-with-Dr.-Aqel-Bashar-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Kim-and-Curtis-Jackson-with-Dr.-Aqel-Bashar-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Kim-and-Curtis-Jackson-with-Dr.-Aqel-Bashar-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Kim-and-Curtis-Jackson-with-Dr.-Aqel-Bashar-16-x-9.jpg 1993w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Curtis and Kim consulting with Dr. Bashar Aqel, director, Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"It's a very rare cancer that tends to grow unnoticed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bekaii-saab-tanios-s-m-d/bio-20413464">Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab</a>, an oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</a>. "If the cancer gets to the point where it's too advanced for surgery or transplantation, universally this is a noncurative or noncurable cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare weapon</strong></h2>



<p>Doctors say a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant </a>can sometimes be an option for some patients. However, not many transplant centers perform liver transplants on patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Mayo Clinic is one of the few centers that do offer liver transplantation for some patients who meet certain criteria.</p>



<p>In Curtis' case, doctors at Mayo Clinic determined a liver transplant was his best chance for survival.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We're not just here treating the cancer. We're also treating the disease that led to the cancer."</p><cite>Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It is a unique form of therapy that is based on research that started at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093">Dr. Bashar Aqel</a>, director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<p>"We developed some protocols that helped us improve the outcome of transplant in these patients, and without these protocols, a lot of patients with this type of cancer would not make it to transplant," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Mayo Clinic's ability to offer this curative option for rare cancers like this has differentiated us from many other transplant centers."</p><cite>Dr. Bashar Aqel, Director, Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Curtis first underwent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a> at Mayo Clinic. He was then placed on the liver transplant waiting list for a donor organ. While waiting, Curtis says he kept his focus on his family.</p>



<p>"I spent all the time I could with my wife and kids, like basketball practices, homework, anything we could do to help our kids," says Curtis.</p>



<p>When Curtis got the call a donor organ was found, he immediately reported to Mayo Clinic to undergo his lifesaving liver transplant. The surgery was a success. Four weeks later, Curtis was back at home with family recovering well and feeling a deep sense of gratitude for his organ donor and his team at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>"Thank you because now I get to see my daughters get married, go to college, I get to see my son live his dreams and go to college and get married," says Curtis. "I get to live and grow old with my wife. I can't say this enough to everyone, 'thank you.'"</p>

<p>"We're already observing excellent function from Curtis' new liver, with the majority of his liver tests returning normal results," says Dr. Aqel. "His recovery has been remarkably swift and impressive."</p>



<p>"A lot of love goes out to the people in that family," says Gwyn Jackson, Curtis' oldest daughter in reference to the organ donor's family. "They allowed us to have our dad back and we're so grateful because we love him so much."</p>



<p>Doctors at Mayo Clinic are monitoring Curtis' progress closely. Meanwhile, Curtis' future is back to looking bright, only now with even deeper gratitude in his heart.</p>



<p>"This truly is the gift of life," says Curtis.</p>
