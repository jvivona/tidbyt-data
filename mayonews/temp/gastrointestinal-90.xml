<p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts. This rare liver disease is often accompanied by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Together, these diseases increase the risk of colorectal cancer by more than sixfold compared to the general population.</p>



<p>Until recently, it&amp;nbsp;<a>wasn't</a>&amp;nbsp;clear whether that increased colorectal cancer risk extended to people with PSC alone, but Mayo Clinic researchers have helped answer this question. Their findings could help open the door to earlier colorectal cancer screening and better prevention for people with PSC.</p>

<p>"We wanted to answer something that was overlooked in the guidelines because these patients are a smaller group and have been understudied in research," says Dr.&nbsp;Saqr Alsakarneh, a fellow in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/overview/ovc-20348241?customer_id=919-955-2329&amp;amp;mc_id=google&amp;amp;campaign=8927988164&amp;amp;geo=9199032&amp;amp;kw=mayo%20clinic%20gastroenterology&amp;amp;ad=458309235531&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;sitetarget=&amp;amp;adgroup=111165104350&amp;amp;extension=&amp;amp;target=kwd-367650091164&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;account=9199552329&amp;amp;invsrc=arizona&amp;amp;placementsite=arizona&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=8927988164&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8Qu28LZ_ykDEhzwUdztX41xIe9R&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw58PGBhCkARIsADbDilxBHSas-T8H9QdFt0dNSntXtQI6tzhJ5Pej5p9tpWeYJda5z2MOamwaAuh3EALw_wcB">Department of Gastroenterology at Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;and lead author of the study,&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.70303">Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Searching data for cancer prevention blind spots</strong></h2>



<p>In the largest population-based analysis of its kind, Dr. Alsakarneh and his co-authors analyzed data from 115 million de-identified health records from 65 healthcare organizations across the U.S. Their goal was to understand long-term risk of colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers in people with PSC.</p>



<p>The researchers found that&amp;nbsp;people with PSC without IBD have&amp;nbsp;<a>nearly three</a>&amp;nbsp;times the risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to the general population.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is important because it challenges the current assumption that only&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a>&amp;nbsp;with IBD causes colorectal cancer," says&amp;nbsp;Dr.&amp;nbsp;<a>Alsakarneh</a>.</p>



<p>While colorectal cancer prevention guidelines recommend annual screening and increased surveillance for people who have PSC and IBD, no specific guidelines exist for people with only PSC. Dr. Alsakarneh says this is a missed opportunity for early detection of colorectal cancer, which is highly preventable with proper screening.</p>



<p>In addition to discovering an increased risk for colorectal cancer, the study&amp;nbsp;confirmed an association between PSC alone and higher rates of bile duct,&amp;nbsp;<a>liver</a>&amp;nbsp;and pancreatic cancers. While previous research has suggested this connection, the study provides large-scale data to support the need for continued vigilance and screening strategies tailored to people with PSC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating discovery to better care</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Alsakarneh says these findings are an important first step toward a better understanding of PSC and cancer risk, although more studies are needed to confirm how this information should be incorporated into healthcare guidelines.</p>



<p>"Before anything is put into guidelines, the first step is always to validate the findings," says Dr. Alsakarneh. "Colleagues from the gastrointestinal community have reached out and are interested, so this is something we are working on."</p>



<p>As researchers investigate further, Dr. Alsakarneh says&amp;nbsp;<a>it's</a>&amp;nbsp;important that clinicians with PSC patients be aware of this association, tune into emerging evidence and keep their patients informed as findings develop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Continuing a legacy of PSC discovery at Mayo Clinic</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Alsakarneh's research continues a legacy of PSC discovery at Mayo Clinic that&nbsp;dates back to&nbsp;the '70s. That was when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/larusso-nicholas-f-m-d/bio-20053658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nicholas LaRusso</a>, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic, first began studying the cluster of symptoms that he eventually helped describe and define as PSC in a 1980&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7399227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.  </p>

<p>"It's important to me that this study comes from Mayo Clinic because Dr. LaRusso, who still has a lab here, made so much progress in this disease. He is the reason I came to Mayo Clinic to do my training," says Dr. Alsakarneh.</p>



<p>Alongside Dr. LaRusso, Dr. Alsakarneh next plans to lead Mayo Clinic research investigating why and how PSC increases cancer risk.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&amp;nbsp;</strong>I've recently been diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-inflammatory-bowel-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. I'm trying to understand what IBD is and how it will affect me. Will I need surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>Inflammatory bowel disease, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/inflammatory-bowel-disease-clinic/overview/ovc-20357763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IBD,</a> is an umbrella term for a group of chronic conditions that cause inflammation and swelling in the digestive tract. It primarily includes two conditions:&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a>. While both involve inflammation, they affect different parts of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and behave differently over time.</p>



<p>Symptoms of both categories of IBD usually include belly pain, diarrhea, rectal bleeding, extreme fatigue. Ulcerative colitis typically affects the&nbsp;colon and rectum, and it leads to the development of sores called ulcers. Crohn's disease primarily affects the small intestine and often involves the deeper layers of the digestive tract and weight loss. Some people experience mild illness, while in others, the disease can be debilitating and lead to life-threatening complications.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of inflammatory bowel disease" class="wp-image-221939" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Diagnosing IBD</strong></h2>



<p>Diagnosing IBD involves a combination of tests and procedures. Your care team will begin by taking a detailed medical history and asking about your symptoms. To confirm the diagnosis, your care team may recommend:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Blood tests&amp;nbsp;to check for signs of inflammation, anemia or infection.</li>



<li>Stool studies&amp;nbsp;to rule out infections and detect markers of inflammation.</li>



<li>Endoscopic procedures, such as:<ul><li>Colonoscopy, which allows doctors to view the entire colon and take biopsies.</li></ul><ul><li>Flexible sigmoidoscopy, used when the colon is too inflamed for a complete colonoscopy.</li></ul><ul><li>Upper endoscopy, if symptoms involve the upper GI tract.</li></ul><ul><li>Capsule endoscopy, where you swallow a small camera to examine the small intestine.</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Balloon-assisted enteroscopy, which is used to explore deeper parts of the small bowel.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>A biopsy, a small tissue sample taken during endoscopy, is essential to confirm the diagnosis and distinguish IBD from other causes of inflammation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the role of surgery</strong></h2>



<p>Most people with IBD are treated first with medications. These include anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressors and biologics that target specific pathways in the immune response. However,&amp;nbsp;surgery can become necessary&amp;nbsp;when medications are no longer effective, not well tolerated or when complications arise.</p>



<p>In ulcerative colitis, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colectomy/about/pac-20384631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colectomy</a> is performed when medications fail or when complications like perforation, obstruction, or cancerous changes occur. A colectomy is when the surgeon removes the entire colon and rectum. An internal pouch is then made and surgically attached to the anus to allow passing waste without an external bag. Sometimes, an internal pouch isn't possible. In these cases, a permanent opening is surgically created in the abdomen, called an ileostomy.</p>



<p>Up to two-thirds of people with Crohn’s disease will require at least one surgery in their lifetime. During this operation, the surgeon removes the damaged part of the digestive tract and reconnects the healthy sections. Surgeons aim to preserve as much of the healthy intestine as possible. Surgery also may be needed for issues such as fistulas, bowel obstructions or perforations.</p>



<p>Surgical decisions are highly individualized and should be made in collaboration between the patient, gastroenterologist and surgeon. Factors that influence the decision include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Severity and location of disease.</li>



<li>Response to medications.</li>



<li>Overall health and nutritional status.</li>



<li>Quality of life and personal preferences.</li>
</ul>



<p>In urgent situations, such as a perforated bowel or severe bleeding, surgery may be performed immediately. But in most cases, there's time for thoughtful discussion and planning.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to expect moving forward</strong></h2>



<p>If you're facing surgery for IBD, know that you're not alone — and you're not without options. The goal of surgery is always to improve your quality of life, reduce symptoms and prevent complications. Seek care from centers like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/inflammatory-bowel-disease-clinic/overview/ovc-20357763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> that are well versed in IBD treatment and that approach care in a collaborative, compassionate way, tailoring the treatment plan to your unique needs.</p>



<p>Patients should feel empowered to ask questions and be part of the decision-making process. When surgery isn't urgent, your team will work with you to ensure you're in the best possible health before the operation and choose the approach to support long-term success.</p>

<p>Curtis Jackson was living his dream life — a loving and supportive wife, three wonderful kids, and a future that looked as bright as could be.</p>



<p>Then, one day, without warning, the dream was shattered.</p>



<p>At only 46, Curtis was diagnosed with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholangiocarcinoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20352408">cholangiocarcinoma</a>, one of the deadliest and most aggressive forms of cancer. It's a silent killer that strikes the liver. It is often diagnosed in later stages, leaving patients with few treatment options and little time to live.</p>



<p>The Jackson family turned to Mayo Clinic, where a team of experts fought the cancer with a weapon rarely used in the battle against this aggressive form of cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Years before his cancer diagnosis, Curtis was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC)</a>. PSC is a chronic liver disease that causes inflammation and scarring to the bile ducts, which work with the liver to help with digestion.</p>



<p>PSC put the Arizona man at higher risk for liver cancer, requiring him to get regular diagnostic screenings. As with most forms of cancer, but particularly cholangiocarcinoma, doctors say early detection is key to improving patient outcomes.</p>



<p>However, with cholangiocarcinoma, there are often no warning signs or symptoms alerting patients of the need to consult with their doctor about getting screened, until it's too late. In Curtis' case, the cholangiocarcinoma was detected in one of his routine screenings at Mayo Clinic, which doctors say likely helped save his life.</p>

<p>"It's a very rare cancer that tends to grow unnoticed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bekaii-saab-tanios-s-m-d/bio-20413464">Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab</a>, an oncologist with the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</a>. "If the cancer gets to the point where it's too advanced for surgery or transplantation, universally this is a noncurative or noncurable cancer."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rare weapon</strong></h2>



<p>Doctors say a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant </a>can sometimes be an option for some patients. However, not many transplant centers perform liver transplants on patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. Mayo Clinic is one of the few centers that do offer liver transplantation for some patients who meet certain criteria.</p>



<p>In Curtis' case, doctors at Mayo Clinic determined a liver transplant was his best chance for survival.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We're not just here treating the cancer. We're also treating the disease that led to the cancer."</p><cite>Dr. Tanios Bekaii-Saab, Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"It is a unique form of therapy that is based on research that started at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093">Dr. Bashar Aqel</a>, director of the Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona.</p>



<p>"We developed some protocols that helped us improve the outcome of transplant in these patients, and without these protocols, a lot of patients with this type of cancer would not make it to transplant," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"Mayo Clinic's ability to offer this curative option for rare cancers like this has differentiated us from many other transplant centers."</p><cite>Dr. Bashar Aqel, Director, Mayo Clinic Transplant Center in Arizona</cite></blockquote></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Curtis first underwent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/radiation-therapy/about/pac-20385162" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a> at Mayo Clinic. He was then placed on the liver transplant waiting list for a donor organ. While waiting, Curtis says he kept his focus on his family.</p>



<p>"I spent all the time I could with my wife and kids, like basketball practices, homework, anything we could do to help our kids," says Curtis.</p>



<p>When Curtis got the call a donor organ was found, he immediately reported to Mayo Clinic to undergo his lifesaving liver transplant. The surgery was a success. Four weeks later, Curtis was back at home with family recovering well and feeling a deep sense of gratitude for his organ donor and his team at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>"Thank you because now I get to see my daughters get married, go to college, I get to see my son live his dreams and go to college and get married," says Curtis. "I get to live and grow old with my wife. I can't say this enough to everyone, 'thank you.'"</p>

<p>"We're already observing excellent function from Curtis' new liver, with the majority of his liver tests returning normal results," says Dr. Aqel. "His recovery has been remarkably swift and impressive."</p>



<p>"A lot of love goes out to the people in that family," says Gwyn Jackson, Curtis' oldest daughter in reference to the organ donor's family. "They allowed us to have our dad back and we're so grateful because we love him so much."</p>



<p>Doctors at Mayo Clinic are monitoring Curtis' progress closely. Meanwhile, Curtis' future is back to looking bright, only now with even deeper gratitude in his heart.</p>



<p>"This truly is the gift of life," says Curtis.</p>

<p>The liver is the largest internal organ of the body. It is essential for metabolism, digesting food and ridding the body of toxic substances. Liver failure can happen quickly, or over time.</p>



<p>"Once liver disease advances, the only way we can reverse the process and give the patient their life back is by replacing the liver, " says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>When patients become a candidate for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">liver transplant</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank">,</a> they are added to a waitlist. Unfortunately, there are more people waiting for a liver than there are available organs.</p>



<p>"As the patient is waiting on the list, they usually are anxiously waiting for that call when a donor becomes available. And that's what we call the deceased donor liver transplantation."</p>



<p>Another option is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">living liver transplant</a>. It's a major surgery where a person donates two-thirds of his or her liver. Donors needs to go through an extensive evaluation to make sure they can donate safely.</p>



<p>"A healthy liver is able to regenerate, and you will be surprised to know that with living donor liver transplantation, both segments of the liver will grow back to almost the normal size within 90 days after transplantation."</p>



<p>Being a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/living-donor-transplantation-evaluation/gnc-20505893?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/living-donor-transplantation-evaluation/gnc-20505893?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living organ donor</a> may not be an option for everyone, but there are ways to people can sign up to be an organ donor. It can be as easy as checking a box on your driver's license.</p>



<p>"Donating your organs is really donating the gift of life to people who are in urgent need for organ transplantation," Dr. Aqel says.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minnesota — It is a large part of the body that lies deep inside, out of sight and perhaps out of mind: your abdominal core. A new and rapidly developing area of medicine focuses on abdominal core health, including how people can incorporate it into a healthy lifestyle and how to address complex medical problems that arise when it is compromised. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/horne-charlotte-m-d/bio-20558578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charlotte Horne</a>, a metabolic and abdominal wall reconstructive surgeon at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20475393" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, explains what abdominal core health is, how to protect it and risk factors for problems that may require surgery.</p>



<p>"The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/physical-medicine-rehabilitation/news/got-glutes-part-1-the-role-of-the-gluteus-maximus-and-healthy-activation-patterns-in-core-stabilization/mac-20555692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abdominal core</a> is the outside muscular container of your abdominal wall," Dr. Horne says. "This starts at the diaphragm and goes all the way down to the pelvic support muscles. Most of the core is muscle and connective tissue. It's a muscular container that holds your internal organs in. Every time you breathe, bend, bear down to have a bowel movement, you're using these muscles."</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/core-exercises/art-20044751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abdominal core</a> includes abdominal muscles that people may think of as the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/top-10-workout-myths" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">"six-pack,"</a> and oblique muscles and tissue that wrap all the way around the upper part of the abdomen and connect to the midline of the body, Dr. Horne adds. Many nerves lie between the layers of muscle and tissue, including those that extend to the groin, thighs, back and hips.</p>



<p>Those muscles function as a unit and that unit needs to operate well for you and your body to perform daily activities, Dr. Horne says. One way to strengthen the structural integrity of your abdominal core is to engage it during your normal activities, she explains: You do not have to do thousands of sit-ups or become a bodybuilder.</p>



<p>"One of the things we're realizing is that we need to educate people how to appropriately engage those muscles when they do everything from going from lying to sitting and sitting to standing, lifting objects and other basic movements in their daily lives," she says. "When people do <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/pilates-vs-yoga-vs-barre-which-is-right-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yoga or Pilates</a>, they think about pulling their belly button into their spine. That helps stabilize the deeper muscles of the abdominal wall."</p>



<p>Improving abdominal core health involves conscious engagement of the abdominal muscles, "bringing everything in and holding it in," Dr. Horne says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Risk factors for abdominal core problems are wide-ranging. They include <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-fistula/symptoms-causes/syc-20352871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer treatment</a>; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inguinal-hernia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic or severe coughing</a>; and complications from pregnancy (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/multimedia/separation-of-the-abdominal-muscles-during-pregnancy/img-20005895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diastasis recti</a>) and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectovaginal-fistula/symptoms-causes/syc-20377108" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surgery</a>. The most common problems are <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/search-results?q=hernia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hernias</a>, when part of an organ or tissue bulges through a weak spot in muscle.</p>



<p>"Coughing can cause large hernias. When you're coughing, you're bearing down and there is a sudden, acute change in intra-abdominal pressure, almost like punching from the outside in or from the inside out," Dr. Horne explains. "When you're doing that all of the time, it causes significant stress to your abdominal wall."</p>



<p>Avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption can help protect abdominal core health. Smoking increases the risk of chronic coughing, while heavy alcohol consumption to the point of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cirrhosis</a> can cause hormonal changes that in turn weaken the abdominal wall, Dr. Horne says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As knowledge about abdominal core health grows, approaches to protecting it and healing it are advancing, Dr. Horne says. For example:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Pregnancy causes muscles to expand to accommodate a baby, and sometimes those muscles do not go back to normal. Exercise regimens during and after pregnancy can help to stabilize them.</li>



<li>Healthcare experts are realizing that restrictions on movement after surgery may not help and sometimes may be harmful. Rather than telling people not to lift anything, it may be more appropriate to explain how to safely reengage those muscles and tendons, Dr. Horne suggests.</li>



<li>People with inflammatory bowel disease are likelier to have surgery and therefore are likelier to develop hernias. Surgeons now know that in those patients, mesh should be placed in different anatomic planes to prevent the mesh from touching the bowel and potentially causing problems later, Dr. Horne says.</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/physical-medicine-rehabilitation/news/treating-patients-with-pelvic-floor-dysfunction/mac-20431390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pelvic floor physical therapy</a> can help women experiencing urinary or fecal incontinence after pregnancy or menopause, she says.</li>



<li>There is growing recognition that mesh used to repair hernias isn't one-size-fits-all. Dr. Horne's research focuses on hernia repair in women, including mesh and mesh techniques.</li>
</ul>



<p>In her practice, Dr. Horne specializes in complex hernia surgeries.</p>



<p>"Most of the patients that I care for have more of their abdominal contents outside of their abdominal cavity than inside," she explains.</p>



<p>Even with hernias as large as 10 to 15 centimeters, surgeries can be performed with a robot to minimize the incision, or can be done with a mix of robotic surgery and minimal open surgery, Dr. Horne says. She uses 3D-printed models to help plan surgeries. Sometimes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/botox/about/pac-20384658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Botox</a> is used to lengthen the abdominal wall muscles, she adds.</p>



<p>"The best part is that patients go from a dysfunctional abdominal wall to one that is functional within about a week in the hospital," Dr. Horne says. "Seeing them at their checkup a year later is the best thing because they go from saying `I couldn't do anything' to `I've gone on all these trips, I've done all these things that I've wanted to do for years but haven't been able to.' They are so happy that they can put that whole thing behind them, which is great."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC: </strong>A friend was just <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosed with colorectal cancer</a>. She's only 30. I didn't know young people could get this cancer. Can you tell me more about it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Unfortunately, your friend is among a growing number of adults under 50 who are being diagnosed with colorectal cancer. Many younger adults don't consider themselves at risk, since screening for colorectal cancer typically doesn't start until age 45.</p>



<p>That's why it's especially important to know the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warning signs</a>&nbsp;of colorectal cancer and not put off getting medical attention. Early diagnosis is essential to surviving colorectal cancer. If this cancer is found when it's only in the colon or rectum, the five-year survival rate is over 90%. That survival rate drops to roughly 15% if the cancer spreads beyond the colon and rectum.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">&amp;nbsp;<strong>What is colorectal cancer?</strong></h2>



<p>It's not one type of cancer but two:&amp;nbsp;colon and rectal cancer. The large intestine has several regions. The last part of the large intestine is known as the rectum. The other areas of the large intestine are called the colon. The treatments for cancers of the colon and rectum are different.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who is at risk for this cancer?</strong></h2>



<p>Risk factors for colorectal cancer include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Older age</li>



<li>Black race&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Low-fiber, high-fat diet&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Not exercising regularly</li>



<li>Diabetes&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Obesity&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Smoking</li>



<li>Drinking alcohol&amp;nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Those who are at higher risk for colorectal cancer tend to have at least one of these factors:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Medical condition that places them at higher risk.</li>



<li>Genetic condition that increases their risk.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Family history that places them at higher risk. For example, this is could be a first-degree family member such as parents or siblings who have had a diagnosis of colorectal cancer or advanced polyps.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are there warning signs?</strong></h2>



<p>Four warning signs of colorectal cancer are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abdominal pain</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>Although these symptoms can be embarrassing, you need to share them with a healthcare professional — don't put it off.</p>



<p>You may not easily notice blood loss after bowel movements, but that bleeding can lead to low iron levels. If a routine blood test reveals iron deficiency in a young adult, it can prompt the primary care clinician to consider colorectal cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is the screening process for colorectal cancer?</strong></h2>



<p>Your primary healthcare professional may order a screening that can help detect colon polyps or cancer. These tests include:</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stool-dna-test/about/pac-20385153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stool DNA test</a>.</strong> This test uses a stool sample to look for changes in cells' genetic material. Certain DNA changes are a sign that cancer is present or that it might happen in the future. The stool DNA test also looks for hidden blood in the stool.</p>



<p>If your stool DNA test returns positive (abnormal), you'll need a follow-up colonoscopy.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colonoscopy</a>.</strong> This test looks inside the colon. For it to be most effective, you need to thoroughly cleanse your colon, which involves reducing the fiber in your diet. The last step is consuming a special solution to ensure your colon is clean so the gastroenterologist is able to get a clear view. Although preparing for the procedure can be unpleasant, your care team can provide tips to make it more doable.</p>



<p>If the gastroenterologist finds any precancerous growths, called polyps, these will be removed during the colonoscopy and sent for testing. The number, size and type of polyps removed help determine when the next colonoscopy should be scheduled. If cancer is found, your care team will discuss <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353674">treatment options</a> with you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How can I reduce my risk for colorectal cancer?</strong> &amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>No matter your age, there are five steps you can take to avoid developing colon cancer:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Eat your vegetables and healthy fats. </strong>Research has shown that the Western diet correlates to higher colorectal cancer rates. People who eat high-fiber diets are less likely to develop the disease.</li>



<li><strong>Get moving. </strong>Exercise benefits your heart and helps you maintain your weight. It also can lower your colon cancer risk. Aim for 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most days of the week.</li>



<li><strong>Watch your weight. </strong>Talk to your health care team if you need help losing weight.</li>



<li><strong>Limit alcohol and don't smoke. </strong>If you choose to drink alcohol, do so moderately. That means no more than one drink a day for women or two drinks a day for men. And if you smoke, quit.</li>



<li><strong>Follow colorectal cancer screening guidelines.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:&amp;nbsp;</strong>March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-colorectal-cancer/">Colorectal cancer</a> is no longer a disease of older people. People in their 50s, 40s and younger are increasingly being diagnosed with cancers of the colon and rectum. Incidence rates increased by about 2% per year in people younger than 50 during the past decade, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. In 2019, 20% of colorectal cancers were in people ages 54 years or younger, up from 11% in 1995.</p>



<p>Another trend: Rectal cancer is more common than colon cancer in younger people. Of the estimated&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">46,050 new cases of rectal cancer</a>&amp;nbsp;in 2023, 37% will be in people younger than 50 versus 24% in people 65 or older.</p>



<p>Because of these trends, experts now recommend screening for colorectal cancer at age 45. But Derek Ebner, M.D., a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&amp;nbsp;gastroenterologist, says adults of all ages should be aware of the symptoms of colon and rectal cancer and report them to a healthcare professional.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of rectal cancer" class="wp-image-195705" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>"When we detect cancer early, and it's still confined to the colon or the rectum, that five-year survival is wonderful — it's 90% or better. Detecting cancer later, when it's had an opportunity to move beyond the colon or the rectum, the five-year survival is much lower — typically 15% or less," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>Here's what you need to know to prevent colorectal cancer or catch it early when it's most treatable:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Everyone is at average or high risk of colorectal cancer.</h2>



<p>"The truth is everyone's at risk for colorectal cancer," says Dr. Ebner. "But we typically divide people into two groups, those who are average risk and those who are high risk."</p>



<p>People at average risk of colorectal cancer might not experience symptoms associated with the disease and don't have any&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known factors</a>&amp;nbsp;that make them high risk.</p>



<p>"For those at high risk, there tends to be at least one of three variables: A medical condition, a genetic condition, or a family history that places them at higher risk," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>Medical conditions that increase the risk of colorectal cancer include a personal history of colorectal cancer or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyps</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>.</p>



<p>Genetic conditions that increase the risk of colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Familial adenomatous polyposis</a>&amp;nbsp;(FAP) is a rare condition caused by a defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. While most people inherit the gene from a parent, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously in 25% to 30% of people with FAP.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&amp;nbsp;is a condition that increases the risk of many kinds of cancer, including colon and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endometrial cancer</a>, and it is passed from parents to children.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/08/Colorectal-Cancer.jpg" alt="illustration of colorectal cancer" class="wp-image-277806" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/08/Colorectal-Cancer.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/08/Colorectal-Cancer-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>Family history associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer involves a first-degree family member — a parent or sibling — with a colorectal cancer diagnosis or precancerous polyps. If you have a family history, you must start screening sooner and perhaps more often than people at average risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner says healthcare professionals don't yet know the reason for the increased rate of colorectal cancer among younger people, but suspect environmental factors are involved. "Over the last 50 years, we've had major changes in diet —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/02/06/is-there-a-connection-between-ultraprocessed-food-and-cancer/">ultraprocessed</a>&amp;nbsp;food, higher quantities of red meats," he says. "These changes have perhaps led to changes in gut bacteria. Our gut microbiome might not be as protective as it once was. We also question the role of less exercise and increasing obesity rates."</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner encourages everyone to reduce their risk of colorectal cancer by&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/02/01/plant-power-using-diet-to-lower-cancer-risk/">eating a more plant-based diet</a>&amp;nbsp;and exercising regularly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Non-invasive screening options exist, but you may be unable to avoid a colonoscopy forever.</h2>



<p>Most colorectal polyps do not cause symptoms, so you may have polyps without knowing it. This is why beginning colorectal cancer screening at the recommended age of 45 is critical.</p>



<p>Screening reduces the risk of cancer by identifying polyps in the colon and rectum that could develop into cancer. You may need to begin screening younger than 45 if you have risk factors. Ask your healthcare professional when you should start screening.</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner says it's impossible to overemphasize the importance of screening. "If we're able to identify polyps, we have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer. If we diagnose cancer, unfortunately, we've missed that opportunity," he says.</p>

<p>In the U.S.,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>&amp;nbsp;is the most common screening method. A long, flexible tube (colonoscope) is inserted into the rectum during a colonoscopy. A tiny video camera at the tip of the tube allows a healthcare professional to look for changes — such as swollen, irritated tissues, polyps or cancer — in the colon and the rectum. The professional can also remove polyps or other types of abnormal tissue through the scope during a colonoscopy. Sedation or anesthesia is usually recommended.</p>



<p>A&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-screening/art-20046825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-invasive option</a>&amp;nbsp;for colorectal cancer screening is a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stool-dna-test/about/pac-20385153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stool DNA test</a>(offered under the brand name Cologuard), which uses a stool sample to look for signs of colon cancer. The test checks for changes in cells' DNA. Certain DNA changes indicate that cancer is present or might develop. The test also looks for hidden blood in the stool.</p>



<p>"If the result of a stool DNA test or another non-invasive test is positive, it's critical to follow up with a colonoscopy," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know the symptoms of colorectal cancer, and don't wait to talk to a healthcare professional if you experience them.</h2>



<p>The symptoms of colon and rectal cancer can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more frequent bowel movements.</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool.</li>



<li>Narrow stool.</li>



<li>Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain.</li>



<li>A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty.</li>



<li>Weakness or fatigue.</li>



<li>Losing weight without trying.</li>
</ul>



<p>People younger than 50 who develop colorectal cancer seem to experience slightly different symptoms than older people diagnosed with the disease, says Dr. Ebner. "We still see abdominal pain and blood after bowel movements, but the change in bowel habits is more often diarrhea," he says.</p>



<p>A&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/colorectal-cancer-young-people-warning-signs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent study</a>&amp;nbsp;of people diagnosed with early-onset colorectal cancer confirms this. Study participants experienced four warning signs in the period of three months to two years before their diagnosis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abdominal pain</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>"Blood loss after a bowel movement can lead to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iron deficiency anemia</a>," says Dr. Ebner. "But sometimes that blood loss is slow or small, so you may not see it. If we see a sign of iron deficiency on a blood test, that will prompt us to explore further."</p>



<p>If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare professional. "These symptoms can be embarrassing, but I can't stress enough — if you have any of them, share them with a healthcare professional. We see folks experiencing these symptoms for months, sometimes up to a year," Dr. Ebner says. "Any delay in sharing this information translates to a delay in diagnosis, which can lead to later-stage cancer, and later-stage cancers can be more challenging to treat and have lower five-year survival rates. Don't delay. Make an appointment.</p>

<p>"Stages 3 and 4 are considered advanced stages, where the cancer goes into the lymph nodes in stage 3 disease, and it goes into distant organs like the lungs, liver or bones in stage 4 disease," says Dr. Majeed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When colorectal cancer spreads</h2>



<p>The liver is the most common organ colorectal spreads to.</p>



<p>"We are offering liver transplantation as an option to select patients. We have a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-therapy-for-colorectal-liver-metastases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatic artery infusion pump program</a>&amp;nbsp;also available for those patients where the cancer has spread from the colon or the rectum to the liver," he says.</p>



<p>The pump delivers chemotherapy directly to artery that supplies the liver. He says, in addition to surgery, treatment options include better drugs, immunotherapy and targeted therapies.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We have surgeons who specialize in advanced procedures such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/role-for-cytoreduction-surgery-in-metastatic-adrenocortical-carcinoma-new-study/mac-20535815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cytoreductive surgery</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-new-chemotherapy-approach-for-treating-stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIPEC</a>, which is a form of specialized chemotherapy given into the peritoneum for select patients," Dr. Majeed says.</p>



<p>With all these advanced options, Dr. Majeed remains cautiously optimistic.</p>



<p>"Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer where, even if it's stage 4, there is a chance of cure in select cases," he says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I just turned 45 and am dreading my first <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/">colonoscopy</a>. Why do I need to be screened if I'm not having issues? Can you walk me through the process?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you've never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">screening</a> is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we're able to identify&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-you-need-to-know-about-polyps-in-your-colon/">polyps</a>, which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we've missed that opportunity.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a number of ways we can screen for&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colorectal cancer</a>. In the U.S., we most often use a&amp;nbsp;colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with&amp;nbsp;no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-tips-to-make-colonoscopy-bowel-prep-easier/">colon preparation</a>&amp;nbsp;prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we're able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="927" height="521" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1.jpg" alt="pouring colonoscopy bowel prep mix into the bottle cap" class="wp-image-323297" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1.jpg 927w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Proper preparation for colonoscopy is key to success</figcaption></figure>



<p>It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal bloating</a>&amp;nbsp;or discomfort. That's to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736">nausea</a>. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you'll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate.</p>



<p>Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don't do any&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/anesthesia/about/pac-20384568">sedation</a>&amp;nbsp;at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your healthcare team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterwards, there's a bit of a recovery period, and then you're able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don't want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>We still don't have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/11-tips-for-healthier-eating-habits/">healthy diet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&nbsp;can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. —&nbsp;<em>Derek Ebner,&nbsp;M.D.,&nbsp;<strong>Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</strong></em></p>

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&amp;nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>

<p>Case of colorectal cancer has been increasing in adults under age 50, particularly for rectal cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="804" height="452" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Graphic of warning signs of colorectal cancer with Mayo Clnic identifier" class="wp-image-383697" style="width:856px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg 804w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Warning signs of colorectal cancer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>
</ul>
