<p><em>Cancer, stroke, bone loss among diseases and conditions studied in microgravity</em></p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Florida — Mayo Clinic physician and researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-00092417" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Abba Zubair’s</a> work combines two passions — medicine and space — for the benefit of astronauts and people on Earth. His research in space is yielding discoveries in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, bone loss and more. In this expert alert, Dr. Zubair answers five questions about his studies in <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/glenn/what-is-microgravity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microgravity</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are you hoping to accomplish through your research?</h2>



<p>"The goal is to harness the uniqueness of the space environment for the betterment of humanity, be it on Earth or in space," Dr. Zubair says."We wanted to take advantage of the environment at the International Space Station to study how it affects human physiology."</p>



<p>The absence of gravity and the impacts of radiation and vacuum are three fundamental aspects of the uniqueness of space, adds Dr. Zubair, who has sent three research projects to the International Space Station (ISS) since 2017, with more to come.</p>



<p>As a <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative biotherapeutics</a> specialist, Dr. Zubair's work focuses in part on adult&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stem cells</a>&nbsp;— known as mesenchymal stem cells —and their use in future treatments for stroke. He noted that he uses stem cells in regenerative medicine and in supporting Mayo's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/about/pac-20384854" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bone marrow transplant program</a>.</p>



<p>"I also know how challenging it is to grow them in the lab. One of the first fundamentals is to see how the absence of gravity influences how stem cells divide and the growth rate," Dr. Zubair explains. "We wanted to see whether cells grown in space are any better or grow faster than cells grown in the lab. When we did our first space flight, we had a really interesting finding, because we realized that the absence of gravity affects stem cells, but it depends on the type of stem cells." &nbsp;</p>



<p>That led Dr. Zubair to another project on the ISS: studying how mesenchymal stem cells, the precursor for bone-forming cells, play a role in bone formation or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoporosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351968" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoporosis</a>, bone loss. He notes that astronauts tend to lose bone density despite rigorous exercise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How might your research benefit people with cancer?</h2>



<p>Dr. Zubair is also studying how <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/leukemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20374373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leukemia</a> stem cells, the cells that form the seed of this blood cancer, respond to the space environment.</p>



<p>"We are also working to understand the impact of space radiation, from the angle of how we can mitigate the effect of radiation and prevent cancer," Dr. Zubair says. "In the long run, we really want to protect astronauts, especially during long-term space travel, such as to Mars, where they would be deep in space and away from any magnetic field protection that we get from Earth."</p>



<p>The research also may benefit people on Earth by revealing how to protect stem cells or cells in general when there is radiation exposure, such as nuclear accidents, he adds.</p>



<p>In addition, Dr. Zubair's space research could have implications for CAR-T treatment, bone marrow transplants or other therapies for cancer patients.</p>



<p>"If we can understand how stem cells in space, especially <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bone-marrow-transplant/in-depth/stem-cells/art-20048117" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hematopoietic&nbsp;stem cells</a> (cells that live in the bone marrow and produce cells that function in the blood), expand and differentiate to make immune cells like T cells, microphages, we will learn how to make them more efficiently," Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">You've remarked that you can envision a time when people might go into space to receive certain medical treatments. How would that work, and might it be possible to simulate microgravity for those treatments on Earth?</h2>



<p>If cells proliferate more in space, for example if cancer cells go into what is called cell cycle and multiply abnormally when they proliferate, then chemotherapy will be more effective, Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<p>"If that is the case, that absence of gravity can induce leukemia cells or other cancer cells to go into cell cycle, that makes them susceptible to chemotherapy," he explains. "So instead of giving the chemo on Earth, you might go into space where the absence of gravity makes the cancer cells more vulnerable to chemotherapy. That would be one more reason to go to space. That is definitely something that I would love to explore."</p>



<p>It would be difficult to create a comparable microgravity environment on Earth, but technically, it could be done, Dr. Zubair adds.</p>

<p>"Microgravity on Earth is basically like going into a swimming pool, a state of buoyancy where you are kind of in suspension; the gravity is canceled out by the effect of the water," he says. "Now, obviously it wouldn't be pleasant to be in water for quite some time. In the lab, we use a microgravity simulator where cells are suspended. It would be interesting if you could do the same for a human being."</p>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What attracted you to space research?</h2>



<p>Dr. Zubair grew up in Kano, Nigeria, and remembers gazing at the night sky as a child.</p>



<p>"As far back as I can remember, I was always fascinated by what is out there in space. Looking at the moon and all the stars, and really that ignites my passion for space and space exploration," Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's first dream was to become an astronaut, but an adviser in high school counseled him to find a more practical career, and he pursued medicine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What's next?</h2>



<p>One of Dr. Zubair's next two payloads to the International Space Station, not yet scheduled for launch, will examine whether umbilical cord blood cells, rich in stem cells and potential therapeutic value, can be expanded. Another study will explore different cell types that participate in bone formation and whether the problem of bone loss in space can be alleviated through use of a special compound.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"If it works, then definitely we will see how we can treat patients with osteoporosis, particularly women, cancer patients, or people who are bedridden for a long time and are not weight-bearing, which affects their bone," Dr. Zubair says.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair notes that all of his space experiments are done in parallel on Earth with identical cells to compare the two results and validate the findings from space.</p>



<p>&nbsp;"I really think there is a lot out there that is just waiting for us to explore and use," he says. "And that's why I do what I do."</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair has been honored by NASA with the Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal for demonstrating that human-derived mesenchymal stem cells grown aboard the International Space Station could be used for potential clinical applications.</p>

<p>Just one day after undergoing brain shunt surgery at Mayo Clinic, 75-year-old Minoo Press put his wheelchair aside and walked out of the hospital on his own. For the first time in two years, his mind was clear. His balance had returned. He was no longer losing control of his bladder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The significant turnaround followed two years of steady cognitive and physical decline. A retired engineer known for his sharp mind and independence, Press gradually withdrew from daily life. Even simple routines became impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He visited leading medical centers across the country, undergoing spinal taps, surgical procedures and advanced imaging to evaluate for conditions ranging from Alzheimer's disease to Parkinson's.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some clinicians at those institutions also considered <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hydrocephalus/symptoms-causes/syc-20373604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">normal pressure hydrocephalus</a>, a condition in which excess fluid builds up in the brain. But because Mr. Press's symptoms overlapped with signs of neurodegenerative disease, the doctors could not confirm the diagnosis or recommend surgery. They told him there was nothing more they could do.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From rapid diagnosis to life-changing care</strong></h2>



<p>After an exhaustive search for answers, Press's family brought him to Mayo Clinic where he was evaluated by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jones-david-t-m-d/bio-20200690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Jones</a>, a neurologist and director of Mayo Clinic's Neurology Artificial Intelligence Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="684" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Minoo-Press3-684x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-404118" style="width:455px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Minoo-Press3-684x1024.jpg 684w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Minoo-Press3-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/06/Minoo-Press3.jpg 711w" sizes="(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Minoo Press (center) is pictured with his sons, Carl and Cyrus, and his wife, Zarin, before undergoing a stent procedure at Mayo Clinic. At the time, he was unable to walk and used a wheelchair. <em>Photo courtesy of Minoo Press</em></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Jones used an innovative artificial intelligence tool developed by his team, called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinics-ai-tool-identifies-9-dementia-types-including-alzheimers-with-one-scan/">StateViewer</a>. The tool works with a widely available brain scan known as fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, or FDG-PET, comparing a patient's brain activity to thousands of confirmed dementia cases. It highlights patterns linked to nine types of the disease — from Alzheimer's and frontotemporal dementia to less common forms with overlapping symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://n.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213831">study</a> published in Neurology, the tool identified the correct dementia type in 88% of cases and helped clinicians interpret scans up to three times more accurately and twice as fast as standard methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Press's case, the tool helped Dr. Jones rule out Alzheimer's and other types of dementia. That was the turning point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With neurodegenerative disease ruled out, Dr. Jones diagnosed Press with normal pressure hydrocephalus and confirmed that he was a candidate for a shunt procedure to relieve the pressure on his brain and potentially reverse the symptoms.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>A last-minute surgical cancellation&nbsp;made it possible for Press to have the procedure that same week. </p>



<p>Within three days at Mayo Clinic, he had a clear diagnosis, a treatment plan and underwent brain surgery to place a shunt that would drain excess fluid from his brain.&nbsp;The procedure was performed by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/elder-benjamin-d-m-d-ph-d/bio-20406877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ben Elder</a>, a neurosurgeon and clinician-scientist. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Press, who traveled from Chicago, noticed immediate improvements. His thinking was sharper, his steps steadier and he felt like himself again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A clear mind, steady steps and hope</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Jones says Press's case highlights the promise of combining AI with clinical care to accelerate diagnosis, scale expert clinical knowledge and help guide treatment planning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"When you're looking at overlapping symptoms, it's easy to miss the underlying cause," Dr. Jones says. "StateViewer gave us the clarity we needed to make an informed diagnosis and take action."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Press continues physical therapy and says he's improving every day.&nbsp;He hopes his story can help others who are navigating the same often misdiagnosed and debilitating condition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I can enjoy time with my family again and I can go out with my friends. I can even do my own taxes. These are the moments I thought I had lost forever," Mr. Press says. "Mayo Clinic gave me my life back."&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that helps clinicians identify brain activity patterns linked to nine types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a>, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>, using a single, widely available scan — a transformative advance in early, accurate diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tool, StateViewer, helped researchers identify the dementia type in 88% of cases, according to research <a href="https://n.neurology.org/lookup/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000213831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> online on June 27, 2025, in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. It also enabled clinicians to interpret brain scans nearly twice as fast and with up to three times greater accuracy than standard workflows. Researchers trained and tested the AI on more than 3,600 scans, including images from patients with dementia and people without cognitive impairment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This innovation addresses a core challenge in dementia care: identifying the disease early and precisely, even when multiple conditions are present. As new treatments emerge, timely diagnosis helps match patients with the most appropriate care when it can have the greatest impact. The tool could bring advanced diagnostic support to clinics that lack neurology expertise.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The rising toll of dementia</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Dementia affects more than 55 million people worldwide, with nearly 10 million new cases each year. Alzheimer's disease, the most common form, is now the fifth-leading cause of death globally. Diagnosing dementia typically requires cognitive tests, blood draws, imaging, clinical interviews and specialist referrals. Even with extensive testing, distinguishing conditions such as Alzheimer's, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lewy-body-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352025">Lewy body dementia</a> and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-is-frontotemporal-degeneration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frontotemporal dementia</a> remains challenging, including for highly experienced specialists.&nbsp;</p>



<p>StateViewer was developed under the direction of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/jones-david-t-m-d/bio-20200690" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Jones, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurologist and director of the Mayo Clinic Neurology Artificial Intelligence Program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Every patient who walks into my clinic carries a unique story shaped by the brain's complexity," Dr. Jones says. "That complexity drew me to neurology and continues to drive my commitment to clearer answers. StateViewer reflects that commitment — a step toward earlier understanding, more precise treatment and, one day, changing the course of these diseases."&nbsp;</p>



<p>To bring that vision to life, Dr. Jones worked alongside Leland Barnard, Ph.D., a data scientist who leads the AI engineering behind StateViewer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"As we were designing StateViewer, we never lost sight of the fact that behind every data point and brain scan was a person facing a difficult diagnosis and urgent questions," Dr. Barnard says. "Seeing how this tool could assist physicians with real-time, precise insights and guidance highlights the potential of machine learning for clinical medicine."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning brain patterns into clinical insight&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The tool analyzes a fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan, which shows how the brain uses glucose for energy. It then compares the scan to a large database of scans from people with confirmed dementia diagnoses and identifies patterns that match specific types, or combinations, of dementia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alzheimer's typically affects memory and processing regions, Lewy body dementia involves areas tied to attention and movement, and frontotemporal dementia alters regions responsible for language and behavior. StateViewer displays these patterns through color-coded brain maps that highlight key areas of brain activity, giving all clinicians, even those without neurology training, a visual explanation of what the AI sees and how it supports the diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers plan to expand the tool's use and will continue evaluating its performance in a variety of clinical settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;Little is known about what causes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>, and there is no way to detect it early yet. About 75% of the time when someone is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, it has already progressed to stage 3 or stage 4, which means it has spread to other parts of the body. Mayo Clinic physicians, researchers and patients had been working together to learn more about this devastating disease when a 22-year-old patient, who has two rare genetic conditions that dramatically elevate lifetime cancer risk, came to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>The patient carries a hereditary BRCA2 mutation, which is one of the genes that causes hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, and a hereditary TP53 mutation, which causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Imaging also revealed she had an ovarian cyst. Although the cyst was benign, she chose to have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/multimedia/types-of-hysterectomy-surgery/img-20007786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomy</a> with removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes, a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/about/pac-20385030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oophorectomy</a>, because of her elevated cancer risk. Upon further examination, her Mayo Clinic physician and research team detected early, hidden changes in the cells lining her fallopian tubes, revealing signals that may point to the first signs of ovarian cancer before symptoms or visible lesions appear.</p>



<p>"Our team glimpsed a rare and revealing phenomenon in epithelial biology, uncovered through the cells of a young patient living with profoundly high-risk genetic conditions. Using cutting-edge, single-cell technologies, we traced how her epithelial cells were developmentally altered in ways that signaled a high risk for lethal ovarian cancer. These insights could pave the way for future strategies to detect the disease in its earliest, precancerous stages when prevention is still possible," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kannan-nagarajan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20233074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/stem-cell-and-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic and co-lead author of this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1200/PO-24-00589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in JCO Precision Oncology.</p>

<p>"We know that the most aggressive and common form of ovarian cancer often actually starts in the fallopian tube. However, why the fallopian tube and how it starts are not yet known. Knowing how ovarian cancer begins and forms could not only lead to the development of earlier screening tools, but also more personalized risk-reduction strategies and improved guidance around the timing of preventive surgeries and fertility planning," says Dr. Bakkum-Gamez, who is a co-lead author of this study.</p>

<p>Together, Dr. Kannan and Dr. Bakkum-Gamez have established a living fallopian tube biobank at Mayo Clinic. The cells and tissues donated by patients help scientists study how ovarian cancer begins — cell by cell — directly in human tissue. From the patient specimens, organoids, or small versions of the fallopian tubes, can be grown. The biobank includes organoids from patients with average-to-high ovarian cancer risk and specializes in inherited cancer mutations like the ones associated with HBOC syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ovarian cancer precursor</strong></h2>



<p>A healthy fallopian tube consists of two main types of epithelial cells: multiciliated cells that have hundreds of cilia, or hairlike appendages, that help move the fertilized egg through the fallopian tube and secretory cells that secrete fluids to nourish and protect the developing embryo. But in the fallopian tube cells collected from the patient with HBOC syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the scientists saw something they had never seen before. Instead of the two types of epithelial cells, the secretory cells vastly outnumbered the multiciliated cells across the fallopian tube. They also found that secretory cells were driving chronic inflammation — an established contributor to cancer development.</p>

<p>"Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we could see the disruptions in the development of cells lining the fallopian tube lumen — findings that could help reshape how we understand and ultimately prevent ovarian cancer," says Megan Ritting, co-lead author and <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> doctoral candidate. Ritting spearheaded the use of cutting-edge genomic technology in this study.</p>



<p>Furthermore, oral contraceptives containing progestins, or synthetic analogs of the hormone progesterone that is produced by the ovaries, can be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk by up to 50%. However, Ritting and the research team were surprised to see that this patient's fallopian tube cells did not have any progesterone receptor proteins, which suggests oral contraceptives may not have been effective in reducing the patient's risk for ovarian cancer.</p>



<p>"With the generous partnership of patients who allow their cells to be studied using advanced technologies, including organoid models, we are making critical progress in understanding how these cancers develop. This work represents an important step toward identifying opportunities to develop preventive strategies, treatments and approaches that could reduce the risk of fallopian tube and ovarian cancers," says Dr. Bakkum-Gamez.</p>



<p>In the next steps of this research, using the living fallopian tube biobank, the scientists are investigating how and where earliest origins of ovarian cancer take root.</p>

<p>Some of the most harmful genetic changes in cancer are also the hardest to see. These structural alterations, deep within a tumor's DNA, can fuel aggressive growth and evade standard testing, especially when tissue samples are small or degraded.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this challenge, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new computational tool called BACDAC that shines a light on these elusive genomic patterns. The tool helps researchers identify signs of genomic instability using DNA sequencing that reads the entire genome, even in low-purity or low-coverage samples.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The tool could help clinicians better predict how a tumor will behave and guide more personalized treatment choices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Detecting chromosome changes</strong></h2>



<p>At the core of BACDAC's approach is the concept of ploidy, which refers to the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell. While normal human cells have two sets (46 chromosomes total), cancer cells often show large-scale gains or losses, disrupting this balance and enabling unchecked growth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a study <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-025-03599-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Genome Biology, the research team used BACDAC to analyze more than 650 tumors across 12 cancer types. The tool helped researchers detect signs of whole-genome doubling, where a tumor duplicates all of its DNA. This type of abnormal ploidy is often linked to aggressive behavior and treatment resistance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This tool lets us see a layer of the genome that's been invisible until now," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vasmatzis-george-ph-d/bio-00027811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">George Vasmatzis, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author of the study and co-director of Mayo Clinic's Biomarker Discovery Program. "We've spent decades studying the biology of genomic instability. This is the first time we've been able to translate that knowledge into a tool that works at scale."&nbsp;</p>



<p>BACDAC also provides a visual summary of a tumor's genomic landscape. A custom output called the Constellation Plot offers an intuitive view of whether the tumor's chromosomes are stable or disrupted. This may help researchers and pathologists interpret results more easily.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the Mayo Clinic team plans to further validate BACDAC and develop it into a clinically deployable diagnostic tool. It may help inform treatment decisions by providing a clearer view of a tumor’s structural changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>, marked by memory loss, trouble concentrating and thinking, and changes in personality and behavior, devastates patients, their families and loved ones. With new treatments available for people with early signs of Alzheimer's disease, there is a growing need for accessible and cost-effective tests to diagnose Alzheimer's disease sooner. In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers confirmed the accuracy of an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA-approved blood test</a>&nbsp;that can be used at outpatient memory clinics to diagnose the disease in patients with a range of cognitive impairment. The findings are&nbsp;<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>



<p>Standard ways of measuring the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain that indicate Alzheimer's disease include positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and spinal taps. But these tests can be expensive and invasive. More accessible, non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers&nbsp;—&nbsp;measurable indicators of a disease&nbsp;—&nbsp;are needed to improve diagnoses broadly in clinical settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our study found that blood testing affirmed the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with 95% sensitivity and 82% specificity,” says corresponding author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurologist, dementia specialist and clinical researcher. "When performed in the outpatient clinical setting, this is similar to the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of the disease and is much more convenient and cost-effective."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>The research team says their findings show promise in:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Better identifying research participants with Alzheimer's disease brain changes.</li>



<li>Screening and selecting patients with Alzheimer's disease for clinical trials.</li>



<li>Assessing how patients respond to therapy in clinical trials.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>More than 500 patients receiving treatment for a range of memory issues at the outpatient&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/memory-disorder-clinic-florida/overview/ovc-20556902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memory Disorder Clinic</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>&nbsp;participated in the study. They included patients with early- and late-onset cognitive impairment, typical and atypical Alzheimer's disease,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lewy-body-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lewy body dementia</a>&nbsp;and vascular cognitive impairment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients ranged from 32 to 89 years old, with the average age of symptom onset being 66. Alzheimer's disease was determined to be the underlying cause of the symptoms in 56% of the patients. The team also conducted serum tests to measure kidney disease, which can influence plasma biomarker concentrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a>&nbsp;tested for two proteins in blood plasma that are associated with amyloid plaque buildup, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease:&nbsp;Aβ42/40 and p-tau217. The researchers found that p-tau217 levels were higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease versus those without the disease. Higher plasma p-tau217 concentrations were also associated with impaired kidney function, which researchers say should be taken into account when performing the blood test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma p-tau217 concentrations were positive in 267 out of 509 patients, including 233 of 246 patients (95%) with cognitive impairment attributed to Alzheimer's disease.</p>



<p>The study was featured at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aan.com/events/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting</a>&nbsp;in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39030981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous study</a>, researchers from the Mayo Clinic Laboratories team showed the utility of these blood tests compared to amyloid PET scans in research participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Day says the next steps in this research are to evaluate blood-based testing in more diverse patient populations and people with early Alzheimer's disease who show no cognitive symptoms. The team also wants to evaluate disease-specific factors that may alter biomarker accuracy in clinical trials.</p>

<p><em>Late-breaking abstract featured at ASCO 2025</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colon cancer</a> is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S., and while screening has helped detect and prevent colon cancer from spreading, major advancements in treating colon cancer have lagged.</p>



<p>Now, new research led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> found that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery for patients with stage 3 (node-positive) colon cancer — and with a specific genetic makeup called deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) — was associated with a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence and death compared to chemotherapy alone. Approximately 15% of people diagnosed with colon cancer exhibit dMMR and, to date, these tumors appear less sensitive to chemotherapy. The results of the multi-center <a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244715">study</a> were presented during a plenary session at the <a href="https://www.asco.org/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting</a> in Chicago.</p>



<p>"The findings from our study represent a major advance in the adjuvant treatment of dMMR stage 3 colon cancer and will now change the treatment for this type of cancer," says oncologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, who led the study. "It's extremely rewarding to be able to offer our patients a new treatment regimen that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve their chances of survival."</p>



<p>Until now, the standard treatment after surgery for any stage 3 colon cancer has been chemotherapy. However, the researchers note that approximately 30% of patients experience cancer recurrence despite this treatment.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>



<p><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sJgL-vlwpQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: Dr. Frank Sinicrope discusses Mayo Clinic immunotherapy study</a></strong></p>

<p>The clinical trial enrolled 712 patients with dMMR stage 3 colon cancer that had been surgically removed and who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes<a>.</a> The immunotherapy given in this study was an immune checkpoint inhibitor, known as atezolizumab, which activates one's immune system to attack and kill cancer cells, which are responsible for cancer recurrence and spread. The patients — who lived in the U.S. and Germany — received chemotherapy for six months along with immunotherapy and then continued with immunotherapy alone for another six months.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope and others previously studied patients with colon cancer whose cells are unable to repair errors during DNA replication that create a nucleotide mismatch, a condition called dMMR. They noted that these patients' tumors showed a striking increase in inflammatory cells within the tumor, including those that express the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This sparked the idea of using immune checkpoint inhibitors to make the immune cells more effective in attacking and killing the cancer cells.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the data from this study, Dr. Sinicrope recommends this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment to be the new standard treatment for stage 3 deficient mismatch repair colon cancer. The research team plans to approach the <a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>, a nonprofit organization consisting of 33 leading cancer centers, including Mayo Clinic, with this recommendation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study included patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, as these patients can have tumors that show deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).</p>



<p>"We're changing the paradigm in colon cancer treatment. By using immunotherapy at earlier stages of disease, we are achieving meaningful benefits for our patients," says Dr. Sinicrope.</p>

<p>Many people have no symptoms, but in some cases, the infection can spread to the brain, bones, or spine and become life-threatening. Because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a>&nbsp;often mimic the flu or pneumonia, valley fever is frequently misdiagnosed. Current&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tests</a>&nbsp;can be slow and unclear, delaying the right treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/grys-thomas-e-ph-d/bio-00027752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Thomas Grys</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher working in collaboration with Arizona State University, is developing next-generation tools to detect valley fever earlier and more accurately. The goal is to help patients get answers and early treatment.</p>



<p>Here's how Mayo Clinic is advancing the future of valley fever diagnoses.</p>

<p>From the vast deserts of the Southwest to the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Grys at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, microscopic fungal spores of valley fever are the focus of research.</p>



<p>"Spores are kind of like the seeds of the fungus. They are very durable. They can exist and persist in the environment. And they're tiny, so they float in the air and we can breathe them in," says Dr. Grys.</p>

<p>Each year, up to 3% of people in the Southwest are exposed to infection and develop antibodies, no matter how long they’ve lived there. Dr. Grys says valley fever infections are common, but the current diagnostics could be better.</p>



<p>"And one of the most frustrating things is, if someone has symptoms of a brain infection with valley fever, it's difficult to confirm whether they have that in their brain or not, and if they do, they're going to be on antifungal medications for the rest of their life. We cannot cure it from the brain," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rapid test</strong></h2>



<p>That's why this rapid antibody test being developed — similar in format to a COVID-19 test —&nbsp;&nbsp;is so important.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Valley fever test strips" class="wp-image-403113" style="width:684px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Valley fever test strips</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"The test we're working on can detect antibodies in 10 minutes. We still have to wait for the body to respond to the fungus, but once it does, we can provide answers in 10 minutes," Dr. Grys says.</p>



<p>The shortened time to detect fungal antibodies means that answers could be back in time to inform patient care during their visit.</p>



<p>"Some patients come in four or five times until they figure out what's happening. Every single time going to the doctor, you have to find transportation, you might have to find childcare. It's a burden to have to go in," he says.</p>



<p>And for patients, Dr. Grys says the rapid antibody test could change the paradigm.</p>



<p>"The median time to diagnosis is 23 days. Half of the people take more than 23 days to find out they have valley fever. If we can get testing that's more rapid and get answers faster, people will be more prone to test because a decision can be made while the patient is there," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Availability</strong></h3>



<p>The antibody test is licensed to a startup company, and the test is expected to be commercially available for laboratory use by the end of 2025.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>



<p>For advanced cases of valley fever, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cocci-clinic/overview/ovc-20457111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cocci Clinic</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Arizona offers a coordinated, multispecialty team — including infectious diseases specialists, pulmonologists, neurologists, dermatologists and cardiothoracic surgeons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This study explores the relationship between hospitals' implementation of telehealth services and the impact on patients' social needs," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/spaulding-aaron-c-ph-d/bio-20249847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Spaulding, Ph.D.</a>, a healthcare researcher at the <a href="/Users/M294284/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/3BAWTU3E/Mayo%20Clinic%20Robert%20D.%20and%20Patricia%20E.%20Kern%20Center%20for%20the%20Science%20of%20Health%20Care%20Delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> and senior author of the study.&nbsp; "The study aims to determine the effects on four key outcomes: better patient health, reduced hospital service use, lowered healthcare costs and enhanced community health."</p>



<p>The study also found that when patients used online therapy, they were much more likely to say their overall health in the community had improved compared to those who did not receive such services.</p>



<p>The study investigators say that the findings provide a closer look into telehealth's versatile ability to address social determinants of health and offer a path for future research into ways to enhance overall patient-centered care.</p>



<p>"There has been significant research identifying gaps in healthcare due to social determinants of health,"</p>



<p>says Dr. Spaulding. "The publication team has explored various avenues to understand the barriers to access and areas that inadvertently worsen outcomes related to social determinants."</p>



<p>Dr. Spaulding notes that telehealth, when combined with in-person visits, has the potential to help create a more integrated approach to healthcare delivery, but says that it should be treated as a complementary tool and that any approach needs to be personalized.</p>



<p>"Different patients require varying levels of care, and while our systems are improving, some patients may benefit from telehealth, while others may prefer in-person care," says Dr. Spaulding.&nbsp; "Additionally, a combination of approaches might be beneficial for certain individuals."</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the researchers emphasize the need to continue focusing on strategically and thoughtfully deploying telehealth services in patient care.</p>



<p>"We must continue to assess the most effective ways to use telehealth to benefit patients," says Dr. Spaulding. "This evaluation should consider both hospital-specific outcomes, such as readmissions and emergency department visits, as well as patient experience and patient-reported outcomes."</p>
