<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&amp;nbsp;Little is known about what causes <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a>, and there is no way to detect it early yet. About 75% of the time when someone is diagnosed with ovarian cancer, it has already progressed to stage 3 or stage 4, which means it has spread to other parts of the body. Mayo Clinic physicians, researchers and patients had been working together to learn more about this devastating disease when a 22-year-old patient, who has two rare genetic conditions that dramatically elevate lifetime cancer risk, came to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>The patient carries a hereditary BRCA2 mutation, which is one of the genes that causes hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome, and a hereditary TP53 mutation, which causes Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Imaging also revealed she had an ovarian cyst. Although the cyst was benign, she chose to have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mastectomy/about/pac-20394670" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mastectomy</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/multimedia/types-of-hysterectomy-surgery/img-20007786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomy</a> with removal of her ovaries and fallopian tubes, a procedure called a bilateral salpingo-<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/oophorectomy/about/pac-20385030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oophorectomy</a>, because of her elevated cancer risk. Upon further examination, her Mayo Clinic physician and research team detected early, hidden changes in the cells lining her fallopian tubes, revealing signals that may point to the first signs of ovarian cancer before symptoms or visible lesions appear.</p>



<p>"Our team glimpsed a rare and revealing phenomenon in epithelial biology, uncovered through the cells of a young patient living with profoundly high-risk genetic conditions. Using cutting-edge, single-cell technologies, we traced how her epithelial cells were developmentally altered in ways that signaled a high risk for lethal ovarian cancer. These insights could pave the way for future strategies to detect the disease in its earliest, precancerous stages when prevention is still possible," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kannan-nagarajan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20233074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/stem-cell-and-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic and co-lead author of this <a href="https://doi.org/10.1200/PO-24-00589" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in JCO Precision Oncology.</p>

<p>"We know that the most aggressive and common form of ovarian cancer often actually starts in the fallopian tube. However, why the fallopian tube and how it starts are not yet known. Knowing how ovarian cancer begins and forms could not only lead to the development of earlier screening tools, but also more personalized risk-reduction strategies and improved guidance around the timing of preventive surgeries and fertility planning," says Dr. Bakkum-Gamez, who is a co-lead author of this study.</p>

<p>Together, Dr. Kannan and Dr. Bakkum-Gamez have established a living fallopian tube biobank at Mayo Clinic. The cells and tissues donated by patients help scientists study how ovarian cancer begins — cell by cell — directly in human tissue. From the patient specimens, organoids, or small versions of the fallopian tubes, can be grown. The biobank includes organoids from patients with average-to-high ovarian cancer risk and specializes in inherited cancer mutations like the ones associated with HBOC syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ovarian cancer precursor</strong></h2>



<p>A healthy fallopian tube consists of two main types of epithelial cells: multiciliated cells that have hundreds of cilia, or hairlike appendages, that help move the fertilized egg through the fallopian tube and secretory cells that secrete fluids to nourish and protect the developing embryo. But in the fallopian tube cells collected from the patient with HBOC syndrome and Li-Fraumeni syndrome, the scientists saw something they had never seen before. Instead of the two types of epithelial cells, the secretory cells vastly outnumbered the multiciliated cells across the fallopian tube. They also found that secretory cells were driving chronic inflammation — an established contributor to cancer development.</p>

<p>"Through single-cell RNA sequencing, we could see the disruptions in the development of cells lining the fallopian tube lumen — findings that could help reshape how we understand and ultimately prevent ovarian cancer," says Megan Ritting, co-lead author and <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> doctoral candidate. Ritting spearheaded the use of cutting-edge genomic technology in this study.</p>



<p>Furthermore, oral contraceptives containing progestins, or synthetic analogs of the hormone progesterone that is produced by the ovaries, can be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk by up to 50%. However, Ritting and the research team were surprised to see that this patient's fallopian tube cells did not have any progesterone receptor proteins, which suggests oral contraceptives may not have been effective in reducing the patient's risk for ovarian cancer.</p>



<p>"With the generous partnership of patients who allow their cells to be studied using advanced technologies, including organoid models, we are making critical progress in understanding how these cancers develop. This work represents an important step toward identifying opportunities to develop preventive strategies, treatments and approaches that could reduce the risk of fallopian tube and ovarian cancers," says Dr. Bakkum-Gamez.</p>



<p>In the next steps of this research, using the living fallopian tube biobank, the scientists are investigating how and where earliest origins of ovarian cancer take root.</p>

<p>Some of the most harmful genetic changes in cancer are also the hardest to see. These structural alterations, deep within a tumor's DNA, can fuel aggressive growth and evade standard testing, especially when tissue samples are small or degraded.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To address this challenge, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed a new computational tool called BACDAC that shines a light on these elusive genomic patterns. The tool helps researchers identify signs of genomic instability using DNA sequencing that reads the entire genome, even in low-purity or low-coverage samples.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The tool could help clinicians better predict how a tumor will behave and guide more personalized treatment choices.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Detecting chromosome changes</strong></h2>



<p>At the core of BACDAC's approach is the concept of ploidy, which refers to the number of complete sets of chromosomes in a cell. While normal human cells have two sets (46 chromosomes total), cancer cells often show large-scale gains or losses, disrupting this balance and enabling unchecked growth.&amp;nbsp;</p>

"We've spent decades studying the biology of genomic instability. This is the first time we've been able to translate that knowledge into a tool that works at scale."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>BACDAC also provides a visual summary of a tumor's genomic landscape. A custom output called the Constellation Plot offers an intuitive view of whether the tumor's chromosomes are stable or disrupted. This may help researchers and pathologists interpret results more easily.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the Mayo Clinic team plans to further validate BACDAC and develop it into a clinically deployable diagnostic tool. It may help inform treatment decisions by providing a clearer view of a tumor’s structural changes.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The study was supported in part by the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine and the Mayo Clinic Center for Digital Health.

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>, marked by memory loss, trouble concentrating and thinking, and changes in personality and behavior, devastates patients, their families and loved ones. With new treatments available for people with early signs of Alzheimer's disease, there is a growing need for accessible and cost-effective tests to diagnose Alzheimer's disease sooner. In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers confirmed the accuracy of an&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA-approved blood test</a>&amp;nbsp;that can be used at outpatient memory clinics to diagnose the disease in patients with a range of cognitive impairment.

<p>Standard ways of measuring the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain that indicate Alzheimer's disease include positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and spinal taps. But these tests can be expensive and invasive. More accessible, non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;measurable indicators of a disease&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;are needed to improve diagnoses broadly in clinical settings.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our study found that blood testing affirmed the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with 95% sensitivity and 82% specificity,” says corresponding author&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurologist, dementia specialist and clinical researcher. "When performed in the outpatient clinical setting, this is similar to the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of the disease and is much more convenient and cost-effective."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>The research team says their findings show promise in:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Better identifying research participants with Alzheimer's disease brain changes.</li>



<li>Screening and selecting patients with Alzheimer's disease for clinical trials.</li>



<li>Assessing how patients respond to therapy in clinical trials.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>More than 500 patients receiving treatment for a range of memory issues at the outpatient&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/memory-disorder-clinic-florida/overview/ovc-20556902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memory Disorder Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>&amp;nbsp;participated in the study. They included patients with early- and late-onset cognitive impairment, typical and atypical Alzheimer's disease,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lewy-body-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lewy body dementia</a>&amp;nbsp;and vascular cognitive impairment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients ranged from 32 to 89 years old, with the average age of symptom onset being 66. Alzheimer's disease was determined to be the underlying cause of the symptoms in 56% of the patients. The team also conducted serum tests to measure kidney disease, which can influence plasma biomarker concentrations.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a>&amp;nbsp;tested for two proteins in blood plasma that are associated with amyloid plaque buildup, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease:&amp;nbsp;Aβ42/40 and p-tau217. The researchers found that p-tau217 levels were higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease versus those without the disease. Higher plasma p-tau217 concentrations were also associated with impaired kidney function, which researchers say should be taken into account when performing the blood test.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma p-tau217 concentrations were positive in 267 out of 509 patients, including 233 of 246 patients (95%) with cognitive impairment attributed to Alzheimer's disease.</p>



<p>The study was featured at the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.aan.com/events/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting</a>&amp;nbsp;in April.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39030981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous study</a>, researchers from the Mayo Clinic Laboratories team showed the utility of these blood tests compared to amyloid PET scans in research participants.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Day says the next steps in this research are to evaluate blood-based testing in more diverse patient populations and people with early Alzheimer's disease who show no cognitive symptoms. The team also wants to evaluate disease-specific factors that may alter biomarker accuracy in clinical trials.</p>

<p><em>Late-breaking abstract featured at ASCO 2025</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colon cancer</a> is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S., and while screening has helped detect and prevent colon cancer from spreading, major advancements in treating colon cancer have lagged.</p>



<p>Now, new research led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> found that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery for patients with stage 3 (node-positive) colon cancer — and with a specific genetic makeup called deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) — was associated with a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence and death compared to chemotherapy alone. Approximately 15% of people diagnosed with colon cancer exhibit dMMR and, to date, these tumors appear less sensitive to chemotherapy. The results of the multi-center <a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244715">study</a> were presented during a plenary session at the <a href="https://www.asco.org/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting</a> in Chicago.</p>



<p>"The findings from our study represent a major advance in the adjuvant treatment of dMMR stage 3 colon cancer and will now change the treatment for this type of cancer," says oncologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, who led the study. "It's extremely rewarding to be able to offer our patients a new treatment regimen that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve their chances of survival."</p>



<p>Until now, the standard treatment after surgery for any stage 3 colon cancer has been chemotherapy. However, the researchers note that approximately 30% of patients experience cancer recurrence despite this treatment.&amp;nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

<p>The clinical trial enrolled 712 patients with dMMR stage 3 colon cancer that had been surgically removed and who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes<a>.</a> The immunotherapy given in this study was an immune checkpoint inhibitor, known as atezolizumab, which activates one's immune system to attack and kill cancer cells, which are responsible for cancer recurrence and spread. The patients — who lived in the U.S. and Germany — received chemotherapy for six months along with immunotherapy and then continued with immunotherapy alone for another six months.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope and others previously studied patients with colon cancer whose cells are unable to repair errors during DNA replication that create a nucleotide mismatch, a condition called dMMR. They noted that these patients' tumors showed a striking increase in inflammatory cells within the tumor, including those that express the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This sparked the idea of using immune checkpoint inhibitors to make the immune cells more effective in attacking and killing the cancer cells.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the data from this study, Dr. Sinicrope recommends this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment to be the new standard treatment for stage 3 deficient mismatch repair colon cancer. The research team plans to approach the <a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>, a nonprofit organization consisting of 33 leading cancer centers, including Mayo Clinic, with this recommendation. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The study included patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, as these patients can have tumors that show deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).</p>



<p>"We're changing the paradigm in colon cancer treatment. By using immunotherapy at earlier stages of disease, we are achieving meaningful benefits for our patients," says Dr. Sinicrope.</p>

<p>A new test in development at Mayo Clinic could help doctors diagnose&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-valley-fever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valley fever</a>&amp;nbsp;faster, possibly at the first visit. Also known as coccidioidomycosis, valley fever is a lung infection caused by breathing in a fungus found in dry, dusty soil, especially in the Southwest.</p>



<p>Many people have no symptoms, but in some cases, the infection can spread to the brain, bones, or spine and become life-threatening. Because&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a>&amp;nbsp;often mimic the flu or pneumonia, valley fever is frequently misdiagnosed. Current&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tests</a>&amp;nbsp;can be slow and unclear, delaying the right treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/grys-thomas-e-ph-d/bio-00027752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Thomas Grys</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher working in collaboration with Arizona State University, is developing next-generation tools to detect valley fever earlier and more accurately. The goal is to help patients get answers and early treatment.</p>



<p>Here's how Mayo Clinic is advancing the future of valley fever diagnoses.</p>

<p>From the vast deserts of the Southwest to the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Grys at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, microscopic fungal spores of valley fever are the focus of research.</p>



<p>"Spores are kind of like the seeds of the fungus. They are very durable. They can exist and persist in the environment. And they're tiny, so they float in the air and we can breathe them in," says Dr. Grys.</p>

<p>Each year, up to 3% of people in the Southwest are exposed to infection and develop antibodies, no matter how long they’ve lived there. Dr. Grys says valley fever infections are common, but the current diagnostics could be better.</p>



<p>"And one of the most frustrating things is, if someone has symptoms of a brain infection with valley fever, it's difficult to confirm whether they have that in their brain or not, and if they do, they're going to be on antifungal medications for the rest of their life. We cannot cure it from the brain," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rapid test</strong></h2>



<p>That's why this rapid antibody test being developed — similar in format to a COVID-19 test —&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;is so important.</p>

<p>"The test we're working on can detect antibodies in 10 minutes. We still have to wait for the body to respond to the fungus, but once it does, we can provide answers in 10 minutes," Dr. Grys says.</p>



<p>The shortened time to detect fungal antibodies means that answers could be back in time to inform patient care during their visit.</p>



<p>"Some patients come in four or five times until they figure out what's happening. Every single time going to the doctor, you have to find transportation, you might have to find childcare. It's a burden to have to go in," he says.</p>



<p>And for patients, Dr. Grys says the rapid antibody test could change the paradigm.</p>



<p>"The median time to diagnosis is 23 days. Half of the people take more than 23 days to find out they have valley fever. If we can get testing that's more rapid and get answers faster, people will be more prone to test because a decision can be made while the patient is there," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Availability</strong></h3>



<p>The antibody test is licensed to a startup company, and the test is expected to be commercially available for laboratory use by the end of 2025.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>

<p>"This study explores the relationship between hospitals' implementation of telehealth services and the impact on patients' social needs," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/spaulding-aaron-c-ph-d/bio-20249847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Spaulding, Ph.D.</a>, a healthcare researcher at the <a href="/Users/M294284/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/3BAWTU3E/Mayo%20Clinic%20Robert%20D.%20and%20Patricia%20E.%20Kern%20Center%20for%20the%20Science%20of%20Health%20Care%20Delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> and senior author of the study.&amp;nbsp; "The study aims to determine the effects on four key outcomes: better patient health, reduced hospital service use, lowered healthcare costs and enhanced community health."</p>



<p>The study also found that when patients used online therapy, they were much more likely to say their overall health in the community had improved compared to those who did not receive such services.</p>



<p>The study investigators say that the findings provide a closer look into telehealth's versatile ability to address social determinants of health and offer a path for future research into ways to enhance overall patient-centered care.</p>



<p>"There has been significant research identifying gaps in healthcare due to social determinants of health,"</p>



<p>says Dr. Spaulding. "The publication team has explored various avenues to understand the barriers to access and areas that inadvertently worsen outcomes related to social determinants."</p>



<p>Dr. Spaulding notes that telehealth, when combined with in-person visits, has the potential to help create a more integrated approach to healthcare delivery, but says that it should be treated as a complementary tool and that any approach needs to be personalized.</p>



<p>"Different patients require varying levels of care, and while our systems are improving, some patients may benefit from telehealth, while others may prefer in-person care," says Dr. Spaulding.&amp;nbsp; "Additionally, a combination of approaches might be beneficial for certain individuals."</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the researchers emphasize the need to continue focusing on strategically and thoughtfully deploying telehealth services in patient care.</p>



<p>"We must continue to assess the most effective ways to use telehealth to benefit patients," says Dr. Spaulding. "This evaluation should consider both hospital-specific outcomes, such as readmissions and emergency department visits, as well as patient experience and patient-reported outcomes."</p>

<p>Dr. Ethel Aguirre Flores broke her first bone before she learned to walk. Since then, she has endured more than 125 other fractures — femurs, arms, ribs and vertebrae. Her medical chart includes 41 surgeries and six metal rods that hold her limbs together.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Her most recent fracture happened just months ago when she broke her toe while dancing. Not long before that, her femur snapped while she was simply walking.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But through it all, her determination, perseverance and commitment to helping others have remained unbreakable.&amp;nbsp;</p>

Read the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/VIDEO-SCRIPT-BRITTLE-BONE-DISEASE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/overview/specialty-groups/pediatric-metabolic-bone-disorders-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteogenesis imperfecta</a>, a rare genetic disorder also known as brittle bone disease, Dr. Aguirre Flores is now completing her residency in medical genetics and genomics at Mayo Clinic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>She came to Mayo specifically to study under one of the leading physician-scientists in the world focused on treating brittle bone disease at the molecular level. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/deyle-david-r-m-d/bio-00097430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Deyle</a>, a clinical geneticist, has spent nearly 30 years studying the condition's genetic underpinnings and building the expertise needed to do what medicine has never done: develop a therapy that repairs it at its source.&nbsp;In addition to leading research, Dr. Deyle devotes most of his time to patient care, seeing nearly 30 patients with rare genetic disorders each week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our goal is to correct the underlying genetic defect of osteogenesis imperfecta," Dr. Deyle says. "That means going directly into the genome, because you can't transplant bone stem cells. You have to repair them at their source."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deyle is developing gene therapy to target the genetic mutation that disrupts collagen, the protein that gives bones their strength. The mutation produces a faulty form of collagen, which leaves bones weak and prone to fractures.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deyle's team is pursuing two primary approaches. One uses gene editing, such as CRISPR, a tool that precisely cuts and modifies DNA, to eliminate the faulty genetic instructions. The other uses a small molecule therapy to strengthen bone density without altering DNA. Both approaches are inching closer to clinical trials.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We can do this in the lab," Dr. Deyle says. "The challenge is delivery — getting the therapy directly into the bone."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="823" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/DEYLE-AGUIRREFLORES-1024x823.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402374" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/DEYLE-AGUIRREFLORES-1024x823.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/DEYLE-AGUIRREFLORES-300x241.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/DEYLE-AGUIRREFLORES-768x617.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/DEYLE-AGUIRREFLORES-1536x1234.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/DEYLE-AGUIRREFLORES-2048x1646.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Dr. Ethel Aguirre Flores and Dr. David Deyle in his gene therapy lab at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on April 14, 2025.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That same precision guides the team's work across a range of rare conditions<strong>. </strong>One project involves classical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</a>, a connective tissue disorder marked by fragile skin and poor wound healing. Dr. Deyle's team is using a combination of gene and cell therapies to give patients a second working copy of the gene they're missing. The modified cells are then reintroduced into the body to aid healing at the site of injury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another effort targets <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurofibromatosis-type-1/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurofibromatosis</a>, a disease that causes tumors to grow along nerves. Dr. Deyle's team was the first to use a viral vector to deliver a key therapeutic protein. The method, which relies on a modified virus to transport treatment directly into cells, could help advance gene therapies for other rare conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the science is groundbreaking, the stories behind it are equally compelling.<strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>Some of the most determined minds behind this research in Dr. Deyle's lab know these conditions firsthand, including Dr. Aguirre Flores. She's the third person with brittle bone disease to train under his guidance.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"People with this condition know what it means to face setbacks," Dr. Deyle says. "That gives them a focus you can't teach. You can see it in Dr. Aguirre Flores — she's a fighter, and she pours everything she has into this work because of what she's lived through."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Aguirre Flores grew up in northern Mexico, the only daughter in a family of four children. Her parents encouraged her to chase every dream. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"They would always let me know anything's possible," she says. "You can do anything you want."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>She swam competitively, earning medals despite broken ribs. She painted with casts on her legs. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At age 8, she met a care team in Texas that changed her view of what care could be. That's when she knew she wanted to become a doctor.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"They saw me as a child first, not just a diagnosis," Dr. Aguirre Flores says. "That changed everything." &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, she brings that same perspective to her own career. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I know what these children are going through. I want to help children with congenital disorders as a whole and help them live their childhood to the best," Dr. Aguirre Flores says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, she will graduate from Mayo Clinic's Medical Genetics and Genomics Residency and begin a new role as a pediatric geneticist in Texas.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I hope that my story brings hope and inspires others to not put limits on themselves," Dr. Aguirre Flores says. "And to always go after your dreams."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&amp;nbsp;Millions of people are affected by chronic dry mouth, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-mouth/symptoms-causes/syc-20356048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xerostomia</a>, an agonizing side effect of damaged salivary glands.

Currently, there is no cure for it.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have established the world's first biobank of human salivary gland tissue-organoids that opens the door to research to find a cure.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/1716990_WF81191_0007-resized-683x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-403041" style="width:184px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/1716990_WF81191_0007-resized-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/1716990_WF81191_0007-resized-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/1716990_WF81191_0007-resized-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/1716990_WF81191_0007-resized.jpg 988w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This unique biobank resource overcomes a major barrier we've faced in the field, namely: limited access to standardized salivary specimens suited for salivary gland regeneration research. This collection provides a foundation for regenerative therapy development, especially for radiation-induced chronic dry mouth," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kannan-nagarajan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20233074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</a>, lead author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-025-00410-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in NPJ Regenerative Medicine. Dr. Kannan is also the director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/stem-cell-and-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>Nearly 70% of patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy experience permanent damage to their salivary glands. People with this condition experience diminished quality of life from a constant feeling like cotton is lining their mouths. Besides being uncomfortable, chronic dry mouth can lead to difficulties with chewing, tasting, speaking and swallowing. It also can cause tooth decay.</p>



<p>"Chronic dry mouth can extend long after radiation treatments are complete. It's among the top concerns I hear from patients with head and neck cancer. Unfortunately, there aren't many therapeutics available commercially for these patients," says&amp;nbsp;co-author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/janus-jeffrey-jeff-r-m-d/bio-20206511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey Janus, M.D.</a>, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>One promising avenue of research is the cultivation of rare regenerative cells to greater numbers that can help people someday heal and grow new, healthy salivary gland cells. The biobank consists of specimens collected from 208 donors. From this repository, researchers have already found biomarkers for mature, saliva-producing cells, and with the help of a high-resolution protein map, they have identified the potential tissue origin of rare, self-renewing salivary cells.</p>



<p>The research team also developed a radiation injury model, which paired with the biobank, provides an integrated platform to discover new, personalized regenerative biotherapeutics.</p>



<p>This is a collaboration between <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-medicine/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Center for Regenerative Biotherapeutics</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>.</p>

<p>September marks the start of soybean harvest in Mankato, Minnesota, a busy time of year when farmers can't afford to be away from their fields for long. So, when Craig Smith, 66, began experiencing a burning sensation while urinating, he went to his family physician right away.</p>



<p>He was prescribed antibiotics, but his symptoms worsened. When Smith began to pass blood, his wife insisted that they drive straight to Mayo Clinic in Rochester — about an hour and a half away. There, Mayo Clinic physicians diagnosed him with metastatic urothelial cancer, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer</a>, which had spread to his spine.</p>



<p>Smith recalls receiving a phone call late that night from his Mayo Clinic doctor, who asked him if he wanted to just maintain his health for a few years or cure his cancer.</p>



<p>"I said, 'I'd like you to cure it,'" says Smith.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking a bladder cancer cure</strong></h2>



<p>Smith's father had been a farmer, which was his dream too. But his father suggested he gain additional skills to supplement his farming income. Following his father's advice and encouragement from his high school welding teacher, Smith pursued his teaching certificate in welding. What he initially thought would be five or six years of teaching turned into a 45-year career developing welding programs at several local schools while also raising cattle and growing soybeans and corn on his 2,000-acre farm. Through his welding programs, he has trained several welders now employed by local manufacturing companies.</p>



<p>After his diagnosis in 2023, Smith took a hiatus from teaching and farming to focus on his cancer treatments at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>, which included chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>Metastatic urothelial cancer that has spread beyond the bladder usually is considered incurable and inoperable. However, Smith responded well to chemotherapy and radiation to his spine, which made his oncologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/orme-jacob-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20545524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Orme, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, and urologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shah-paras-h-m-d/bio-20571894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paras Shah, M.D.</a>, consider Smith for a new, surgical approach to treatment.</p>



<p>Smith proceeded with the proposed surgery and had his bladder, prostate and 36 lymph nodes removed.</p>



<p>"In Mr. Smith's bladder, we found viable cancer cells that would have led to a relapse. Now, however, he is nearly two years from diagnosis and remains disease-free," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>Smith's positive response to treatment and surgery has spurred a clinical trial testing this aggressive approach in other bladder cancer patients. Currently, 17 participants are enrolled, and the results so far have been promising.</p>

<p>Advances in cancer treatment, such as immunotherapy that harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer and the identification of biomarkers in the blood or urine that show how well a patient is responding to treatment, are helping the physicians select who will benefit most from surgery.</p>



<p>"The impetus for this study is to attack the cancer from multiple approaches, including treatments that cover head-to-toe and treatments that are directed right at the source tumor," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boorjian-stephen-a-m-d/bio-00092877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen A. Boorjian, M.D.</a>, who is the David and Anne Luther Chair of Urology at Mayo Clinic and a lead proponent of the study.</p>



<p>"We want to remove the root of the cancer after we've burned off the leaves," adds Dr. Orme.</p>



<p>A team of researchers, physicians and clinical trials staff expedited the clinical trial through an accelerated pathway called a Rapid Activation Trial. It's part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic to launch new clinical trials swiftly and effectively.</p>



<p>"Shortening activation timelines allows us to make a difference to more patients and their families," says Michelle Monosmith, Mayo Clinic Office of Clinical Trials operations administrator.</p>



<p>The study is supported by a generous donation by Ronald J. and Carol T. Beerman to Mayo Clinic and has been prioritized by Dr. Boorjian and Chair of Oncology <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heath-elisabeth-i-m-d/bio-20576547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elisabeth Heath, M.D.</a>, to achieve more cures for men and women with bladder cancer.</p>



<p>"Our only goal is to help our patients live better and longer," says Dr. Orme.</p>



<p>That's what Smith plans to do as he continues to farm, teach and spend time with his family.</p>
