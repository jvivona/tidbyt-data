<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to abdominal imaging can help predict adults at higher risk of falling as early as middle age, a new <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study shows. The research, published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949761225001063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health</a>, highlights the importance of abdominal muscle quality, a component of core strength, as a key predictor of fall risk in adults aged 45 years and older.</p>



<p>Falls are a leading cause of injury, especially among older adults. Mayo Clinic researchers found that early markers of fall risk may be detectable in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scans</a> that many patients have for other reasons.</p>



<p>Working with radiology bioinformatics experts, they set out to determine whether AI-derived measurements of fat distribution, muscle size and density and bone quality could reveal early signs of noteworthy physical changes.</p>



<p>They found that muscle density, a measure of muscle quality, was a much stronger predictor of fall risk than muscle size.</p>



<p>"Muscle size is just a measure of how big your muscles are," says lead author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/st-sauver-jennifer-ph-d/bio-00027743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer St. Sauver, Ph.D.</a>, an epidemiologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>. "Muscle density is different; on a CT scan, it's a measure of how 'dark' and homogenous the muscles are."</p>



<p>More homogenous muscles are denser and tend to have less fat in them, Dr. St. Sauver notes.</p>



<p>"Previous studies have suggested that muscle density, not size, is more strongly associated with physical strength and function," she says. "Our results support the idea that we should be focusing on muscle density, not muscle size, when we try to understand physical function."</p>



<p>The research team expected to see links between poorer performance on abdominal muscle measures and a higher incidence of falls in older adults, but what surprised them most was the strength of these associations in middle-aged adults and how strongly those measures predicted fall risk.</p>



<p>"Leg muscles have been associated with physical function, but our findings show that abdominal muscles also play a significant role," Dr. St. Sauver says.</p>



<p>The findings underscore the importance of maintaining good core strength throughout adulthood, she adds.</p>



<p>"One of the most important messages from this research is to keep your abdominal muscles in the best shape possible," Dr. St Sauver says. "Doing so may provide benefits that start in midlife and continue well into older adulthood."</p>

<p>Evenings in the Staal household often carried a delicate unpredictability. After a full school day — and as Ethan's medication began to wear off — the shift from playful to overwhelmed could happen in seconds. Ethan has <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>, a condition that can make emotional regulation especially challenging.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethan's feelings sometimes escalated faster than he could manage. In those difficult moments, his parents say, he became "not accessible"&nbsp;—&nbsp;often needing close to an hour before they could help guide him back to calm.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Their search for specialized care led them to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo&nbsp;Clinic</a>, where child and adolescent psychiatrist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/romanowicz-magdalena-m-d/bio-20306747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magdalena Romanowicz, M.D.</a>, introduced the family to Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. She also invited them to&nbsp;participate&nbsp;in a first-of-its-kind study powered by a smartwatch and artificial intelligence (AI).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The smartwatch technology was designed to help anticipate when a child was nearing emotional overload, giving parents a chance to step in and defuse the situation before it escalated. For the Staals, the technology offered a clear sense of what was happening inside Ethan just early enough to help him through it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It was a game-changer," Jared Staal says. "We still have challenges, but now we see them coming and we see them through a whole different lens — we didn't always know how to support him in those moments, and now we do."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A window into the moments before escalation</strong></h2>



<p>During the four-month <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Ethan wore a smartwatch that tracked his heart rate, movement and sleep. When the system detected patterns that suggested his stress was building, it sent an alert to Sarah or Jared's phone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It gave us a warning that something was coming," Sarah says. Instead of reacting at the peak of Ethan's distress, they could intervene earlier with calm reassurance, redirection and other techniques they learned in their 12 Parent-Child Interaction Therapy&nbsp;sessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We could help him recover in 5 to 10 minutes," she says. "And we could have our evenings again as a family."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the study revealed</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Staals' experience reflects the study's overall findings.&nbsp;In the clinical trial, smartwatch alerts prompted parents to respond within four seconds on average to early signs of escalating stress. Their children's severe tantrums were shortened by about 11 minutes — roughly half the duration seen with standard therapy alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The broader context underscores the need for new approaches. Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. children lives with a mental, behavioral or emotional health disorder, yet the number of pediatric mental health specialists has not kept pace with demand. Smartwatch technology represents one possible way to extend support into the home by helping families recognize early changes in a child's stress levels.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Across a shared wall</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The technology behind the alerts emerged from an unexpected spark.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Electrical and computer engineer <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/athreya-arjun-p-ph-d-m-s/bio-20473903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arjun Athreya, Ph.D.</a>, worked just steps from the Children's Hospital Psychiatry Unit at Mayo Clinic — a single shared wall separating his world of algorithms and data from the clinical rooms where children and their families experienced some of their hardest moments.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Passing conversations with the psychiatrists next door became more formal collaborations as the team began to ask: What happens inside a child's body in the minutes before an outburst? And could those invisible shifts be measured?&nbsp;</p>



<p>With support from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shekunov-julia-m-d/bio-20359665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia&nbsp;Shekunov, M.D.</a>, Medical Director of the inpatient unit, and help from the nursing staff, the team launched a small pilot to explore those questions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>From that work, Dr. Athreya and his team developed an AI model designed to recognize the earliest physiological changes that precede escalating behavior. That work became the&nbsp;foundation&nbsp;for&nbsp;the smartwatch system now being explored with families.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A family's early role in the research</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>One of the first families to try out the smartwatch system was Sawra&nbsp;and Matthew&nbsp;Maurer and&nbsp;their&nbsp;son, Theo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>For&nbsp;the&nbsp;Maurers, the challenges with Theo were mounting. Calls from kindergarten&nbsp;had&nbsp;become a near-weekly routine: "Theo is having a hard time. Could you&nbsp;come get&nbsp;him?"&nbsp;Around that same time, Theo was diagnosed with ADHD, which helped explain the emotional dysregulation and sudden behavioral shifts they were seeing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theo could slide from being engaged in an activity to overwhelmed in an instant — sweeping crayons off tables or having severe tantrums that&nbsp;sometimes required&nbsp;teachers to guide classmates out of the room. "It was a very difficult year," Sawra recalls.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enrolling in the early smartwatch <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37966360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feasibility study</a> gave her new insight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the study, Theo wore a watch each day that collected his physiological data — heart rate, movement, sleep patterns — while the family logged episodes in an AI-powered app.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That data helped researchers understand what Theo's body was doing in the moments before he became dysregulated. By matching those physiological signals with what was happening behaviorally, the team could begin identifying the subtle shifts that happen as a child moves from calm toward distress and then back to calm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Theo's data helped teach the system what those early changes look like in real-world settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sawra didn't receive alerts in that early phase, but she could see the information the watch recorded. "The idea is wonderful," she says. "Being able to detect when a child is heading toward a severe tantrum would be a phenomenal thing for a parent."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moving the research forward</strong></h2>



<p>Future studies will focus on improving the model, testing the system in larger groups and examining how real-time physiological data can inform care outside the clinic. As that work continues, the experiences of families like the Staals and the Maurers will help guide how the technology evolves and how it can support children in everyday life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PHOENIX&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;researchers have developed and evaluated MedEduChat, an electronic health record (EHR)&nbsp;that&nbsp;works with&nbsp;a&nbsp;large language model to provide accurate, patient-specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are published in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-02166-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Portfolio Digital Medicine</a>&nbsp;and highlight&nbsp;a new approach&nbsp;to delivering&nbsp;timely, individualized guidance for people navigating a prostate cancer diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer patients often face uncertainty as they process complex information about their diagnosis and treatment options. Limited time with clinicians can make it difficult for patients to receive the detailed answers they need to understand decisions that shape their care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;study&nbsp;demonstrates&nbsp;how advanced AI, grounded in Mayo-validated clinical data, can help bridge these gaps by delivering clear, conversational explanations based on each patient's own health record.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the patient experience using&nbsp;AI</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fifteen prostate cancer patients interacted with&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;for 20 to 30 minutes as part of a mixed-method usability study conducted at Mayo Clinic campuses in Arizona and Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients reported higher confidence after using the tool, with Health Confidence Scores increasing from 9.9 to 13.9 on a 16-point scale. Usability scores were also high;&nbsp;average survey responses ranked MedEduChat&nbsp;83.7 out of 100.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients noted that&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;helped them understand their diagnosis in a more accessible way. The&nbsp;tool&nbsp;provided relief by explaining unfamiliar or complex terms&nbsp;in a clear and concise manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversational format&nbsp;helped&nbsp;participants replace incorrect assumptions with medically accurate information derived from their own EHR.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinician-evaluated accuracy and safety</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/liu-wei-ph-d/bio-20055721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wei Liu, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;a radiation oncology medical physicist,&nbsp;and three Mayo Clinic clinicians independently reviewed 85 anonymized question-and-response pairs. They rated MedEduChat's answers as highly correct (2.9 out of 3), complete (2.7 out of 3) and safe (2.7 out of 3).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinicians also noted strong patient-readiness and moderate personalization, reflecting&nbsp;MedEduChat's ability to tailor explanations to each person's age, treatment history and cancer stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&nbsp;MedEduChat&nbsp;delivered&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;and clinically aligned information, clinicians emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring to prevent errors that could arise from incomplete or inconsistently documented EHR data.</p>



<p>The research team incorporated a&nbsp;multilayer&nbsp;approach&nbsp;to address these concerns and guide future system enhancements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Combining patient-centered education with AI</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>MedEduChat&nbsp;was designed with a structured educational model that combines closed-domain clinical data, semi-structured guidance and personalized interaction.</p>



<p>Patients can explore diagnosis details, learn about treatment options and side effects, and review lifestyle considerations and follow-up expectations. The tool draws only from validated sources,&nbsp;such as Mayo Clinic materials and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>&nbsp;guidelines.</p>



<p>"This research demonstrates how large language models can be safely and effectively integrated into real clinical systems to improve cancer education,"&nbsp;according&nbsp;to Dr. Liu.&nbsp;"By combining advanced AI with Mayo Clinic's electronic health records, MedEduChat delivers personalized, accurate and easy-to-understand explanations tailored to each patient's medical history."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expanding AI&nbsp;cancer research</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study team plans to translate this work into clinical use across all three Mayo Clinic campuses&nbsp;in Arizona,&nbsp;Florida&nbsp;and Minnesota. Next steps include expanding MedEduChat beyond radiation oncology to additional cancer specialties. These efforts aim to make personalized AI-assisted education a routine part of cancer care.</p>



<p>This research was funded by the National Cancer Institute, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for AI Research and Innovation, the Fred C. and Katherine B. Andersen Foundation, and The Kemper and Ethel Marley Fund in Cancer Research.</p>

Early on, he saw that many families lived with uncertainty of their cancer risk, especially when genetic tests revealed variants no one fully understood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He set out to change that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Couch&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;consultant&nbsp;in&nbsp;laboratory medicine and pathology&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;and holds the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professorship in Medical Research in Honor of Dr. Thomas J. McDonald.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic works with an international network of collaborators, which includes Dr. Couch and his team,&nbsp;who have&nbsp;helped&nbsp;identify&nbsp;many inherited gene alterations that contribute to breast cancer risk.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We interact on a thematic level — surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, geneticists and biochemists," Dr. Couch shares. "We all work together, focused on improving our knowledge of breast cancer and quickly developing treatments and cures for patients at Mayo Clinic."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year,&nbsp;Dr. Couch and other co-authors&nbsp;published&nbsp;a study in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>,&nbsp;which&nbsp;included&nbsp;one of the most comprehensive functional maps to date of the BRCA2 cancer risk gene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By testing&nbsp;nearly every&nbsp;possible change&nbsp;in this gene, Mayo Clinic researchers can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;which patients are more likely to&nbsp;benefit&nbsp;from targeted cancer therapies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The work reclassifies previously uncertain genetic test results, helping care teams individualize cancer screening,&nbsp;prevention&nbsp;and treatment. Together, it shows how Mayo Clinic is turning complex genetic data into information clinicians can use now, a central goal of&nbsp;precision medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's the extra step that makes the difference, helping people use the findings immediately," Dr. Couch says. "The results of our paper&nbsp;are used to help patients in the clinic. My entire career has been focused on getting information to patients as quickly as possible."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Dr. Couch continues to explore why certain inherited changes lead to cancer, why some families develop breast cancer without known risk&nbsp;genes&nbsp;and how discoveries in the lab can&nbsp;translate&nbsp;to improved&nbsp;care.&nbsp;Just this month,&nbsp;Dr. Couch won the prestigious Komen&nbsp;Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction in Basic Science&nbsp;for his significant work in advancing breast cancer research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Chronic liver disease is a progressive condition, so the sooner we can diagnose it, the sooner we can stop it from advancing to irreversible stages. Early intervention may decrease the likelihood that a patient will need a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a> in the future," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/simonetto-doug-a-m-d/bio-20205767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doug Simonetto, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant hepatologist and lead author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04058-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Nature Medicine.</p>



<p>The heart and liver are closely linked. Liver scarring may lead to increased local pressure that can affect the heart. As a result, a heartbeat test called an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a> can capture electrical signal changes in the heart connected to advanced liver disease. Dr. Simonetto and colleagues <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40146029/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developed an AI model</a> to analyze data from 11,513 Mayo Clinic patients undergoing routine ECGs. The model looked for patterns connected to advanced liver disease in the ECG data, and it found twice the number of patients who were diagnosed by standard methods. The diagnosis was confirmed by validated imaging or <a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/38292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood tests</a>.</p>

<p>"As a family physician, I've often seen how advanced liver disease — which frequently has no symptoms until it becomes irreversible — can go undetected," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/david-rushlow-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Rushlow, M.D.</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a> family physician and study co-author. "Many patients identified through the AI-ECG model had no idea they were living with advanced liver disease. By identifying these cases earlier, we were able to connect them to the right treatment — at a time when intervention can truly make a difference. For these patients, the technology helped us not only to uncover a diagnosis, it created an opportunity for better health outcomes and, in some cases, may have saved lives."</p>



<p>In this randomized clinical trial, 248 clinicians at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and throughout the Mayo Clinic Health System participated.</p>



<p>"The idea that a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive test could help identify patients at risk of developing advanced liver disease was very compelling. This study provided an opportunity to evaluate AI in our real-world clinical environment, where the true test of innovation is whether it improves care for patients in the community," says Dr. Rushlow. "We're only beginning to understand the full potential of AI-enabled tools like this and the promise they hold for preventive, personalized care."</p>



<p>In the next steps, the researchers will follow up with the patients, who were newly diagnosed with advanced liver disease, over the next two years.</p>



<p>The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have created "virtual clinical trials"&nbsp;that&nbsp;advance&nbsp;the discovery of therapies while reducing time,&nbsp;cost&nbsp;and the risk of failed studies by combining advanced computer modeling with real-world patient data&nbsp;as part of the Precure and Genesis initiatives. Through one virtual clinical trial, they have developed a new way to predict whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat heart failure, one of the world's most pressing health challenges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Clinical trials will always remain essential," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cui&nbsp;Tao,&nbsp;Ph.D.</a>, the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair&nbsp;of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics and vice president of Mayo Clinic Platform Informatics. "But this innovation demonstrates how AI can make research more efficient, affordable and broadly accessible. Integrating trial emulation, simulation,&nbsp;synthetic&nbsp;trials&nbsp;and biomedical knowledge modeling opens the door to a new paradigm in translational science."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have uncovered the molecular "switch" that directs a small but powerful set of cells that choose&nbsp;whether to repair tissue or fight infection, a discovery that could inform regenerative therapies for chronic lung diseases, which is part of Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative.<br>&nbsp;<br>"We were surprised to find that these specialized cells cannot do both jobs at once," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brownfield-douglas-g-ph-d/bio-20522531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64224-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>. "Some commit to rebuilding, while others focus on defense. That division of labor is essential — and by uncovering the switch that controls it, we can start thinking about how to restore balance when it breaks down in disease."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/stem-cells-may-offer-new-hope-for-end-stage-kidney-disease-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Stem cells may offer new hope for end-stage kidney disease treatment</strong></a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers&nbsp;found&nbsp;that&nbsp;injecting&nbsp;patients' own stem cells from fat cells into the vein before hemodialysis, a treatment for end-stage kidney disease, often&nbsp;helped prevent inflammation and vein narrowing. This could help millions of people tolerate dialysis longer, extending the time before they&nbsp;require&nbsp;a kidney transplant as part of the&nbsp;Mayo Clinic&nbsp;Genesis initiative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using detailed maps of&nbsp;each&nbsp;patient's unique brain wave patterns, Mayo Clinic physicians can&nbsp;now pinpoint&nbsp;where stimulation&nbsp;is most effective, moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all&nbsp;approach to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epilepsy</a> treatment.

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A new multicenter study led by Mayo Clinic researchers has established a practical, evidence-based definition for <a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/neurology/dementia/rapidly-progressive-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rapidly progressive dementia (RPD)</a>, a rare but devastating form of cognitive decline that develops over months instead of years. The findings, <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Neurology</a>, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, may help clinicians recognize and treat RPD earlier, and enable researchers to work from a shared framework when studying the condition.</p>



<p>While most types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a> progress gradually, RPD advances with alarming speed, often leading to significant cognitive decline or death within one to two years. Although it accounts for around 4% of dementia cases, RPD is difficult to diagnose. Symptoms can stem from numerous causes, including autoimmune disease, infections, neurodegenerative disorders such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a> and rare conditions like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20371226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a>. This makes it challenging to consistently define the disorder across different settings.</p>

<p>"Clinicians need a clear, standardized way to identify patients whose decline is unusually fast," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a behavioral neurologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "This helps ensure that those with potentially treatable causes are recognized quickly, wherever they are seen. Furthermore, this is a necessary step before launching multicenter studies aimed at understanding why a small subset of dementia patients progresses rapidly and how to address this through clinical trials and treatments."</p>



<p>The new definition proposed by Dr. Day and his colleagues uses the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/clinical-dementia-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</a> scale, a well-established tool for assessing dementia severity. Criteria are based on the level of functional impairment involving memory, orientation, judgment, problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Under the new framework, a person is considered to have rapidly progressive dementia if they develop mild dementia (CDR score of 1 or higher) within one year of symptom onset, or moderate-to-severe dementia (CDR score of 2 or higher) within two years. Researchers refer to this as the "1-in-1 or 2-in-2" rule.</p>



<p>To test this definition, the research team applied it to two large datasets. The first, known as the RaPID cohort, included 248 patients evaluated for suspected RPD at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> and Washington University in St. Louis. The second used data from the <a href="https://naccdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center</a>, representing more than 19,000 participants across 46 research centers in the United States.</p>



<p>In the RaPID group, about 75% of patients met the new criteria. Nearly 1 in 3 had autoimmune or inflammatory causes — many of which are potentially reversible. In the broader national dataset, about 4% met the definition for RPD, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common underlying cause. Across both groups, people who met the RPD definition declined 3 to 4 times faster than those with typical dementia, based on changes measured using the CDR scale.</p>



<p>The new definition proved reliable across clinical and research settings, identifying both rare and common causes of RPD. It can be applied using a patient's clinical history instead of specialized testing, making it adaptable in diverse healthcare settings, including those with limited medical resources.</p>



<p>"By uniformly defining rapid progression, we can better identify patients who might benefit from treatment, improve consistency in research, and ultimately enhance care for people facing one of the most challenging forms of dementia," Dr. Day says.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn.&nbsp;—&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;researchers have developed a smartwatch-based alert system that signals parents at the earliest signs of a tantrum in children with emotional and behavioral disorders — prompting them to intervene before it intensifies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a new study <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;in&nbsp;JAMA&nbsp;Network Open, these alerts helped parents intervene within four seconds and shortened severe tantrums by an average of 11 minutes — about half the duration seen with standard therapy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this system, a smartwatch worn by the child detects physiological stress signals, such as rising heart rate, or changes in movement or sleep, and sends them to an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled app on the parent's smartphone. The app analyzes the data in real time and sends an alert as a cue for the parent to connect with their child.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings&nbsp;demonstrate&nbsp;how smartwatch technology can help bridge a gap in pediatric mental healthcare by giving parents actionable support when professional help isn't immediately available. That need is widespread —&nbsp;nearly 1&nbsp;in 5 U.S. children has a mental,&nbsp;behavioral&nbsp;or emotional health disorder, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The approach&nbsp;shows&nbsp;how wearable technology, paired with patient-centric AI design, can support families beyond the clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Study design and results</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the randomized clinical trial, 50 children aged 3 to 7 receiving Parent-Child Interaction Therapy at Mayo Clinic&nbsp;participated&nbsp;over&nbsp;16 weeks. Half were assigned to use the smartwatch system, and half continued standard therapy. The study evaluated whether families would use the technology as intended and whether immediate alerts could measurably change parent response times and children's behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Notably, children&nbsp;wore the smartwatch&nbsp;for about 75% of the study period, demonstrating&nbsp;feasibility and family engagement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This study shows that even small, well-timed interventions can change the trajectory of a child's emotional dysregulation episode," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/romanowicz-magdalena-m-d/bio-20306747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magdalena Romanowicz, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic child psychiatrist who co-led the study. "These moments give parents a chance to step in with supportive actions — moving closer, offering reassurance, labeling emotions and redirecting attention before a tantrum intensifies."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building on earlier research</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>This work builds on the team's earlier study, which used a machine learning algorithm to analyze smartwatch data&nbsp;—&nbsp;including heart rate,&nbsp;sleep&nbsp;and movement&nbsp;—&nbsp;to predict disruptive behaviors in hospitalized children receiving psychiatric care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That study,&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37966360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a>&nbsp;in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, showed the algorithm could predict a child's behavioral state with 81% accuracy and provided a&nbsp;30- to 60-minute&nbsp;advance warning of an impending outburst.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This work shows how basic science and clinical research can come together to transform patient care," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/athreya-arjun-p-ph-d-m-s/bio-20473903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arjun Athreya, Ph.D.</a>, who co-led the study and serves on the engineering faculty in Mayo Clinic's Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. "We've translated inpatient findings to outpatient care, and the results show how data from everyday smart devices can help families in real time."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Empowering families with data-driven care</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/croarkin-paul-e-d-o-m-s/bio-00027440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Croarkin, D.O.</a>, a Mayo Clinic child and adolescent psychiatrist and study co-author, says the findings highlight the power of data-driven care. "A smartwatch may seem simple, but when it's backed by evidence-based treatments and advanced analytics, it becomes a lifeline for families trying to manage severe behavioral symptoms at home."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shekunov-julia-m-d/bio-20359665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia Shekunov, M.D.</a>,&nbsp;medical&nbsp;director of Mayo Clinic's Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Inpatient Unit&nbsp;and also&nbsp;a study co-author, says the work addresses an urgent need. "We're seeing more children in crisis, and&nbsp;the severity&nbsp;is increasing. This system gives parents tools they can use immediately, even outside the clinic, to help their child regain control."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Future studies will refine the system's predictive accuracy, test it in larger&nbsp;groups&nbsp;and assess its long-term benefits in routine outpatient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This study was funded in part by&nbsp;a Mayo&nbsp;Clinic Clinical Trial Stimulus Fund and Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine.

<p>"Liver scarring and inflammation are hallmarks of MASH. If left untreated, it can progress to liver cancer. This is why it's so important to understand the mechanisms driving the disease so that we can prevent it or develop more effective treatments," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/cell-molecular-aging/faculty-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stella Victorelli, Ph.D.</a>, who is the lead author of the <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-66159-z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Nature Communications. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Victorelli and colleagues, who study aged or senescent "zombie" cells, identified a mechanism by which these cells drive liver scarring and inflammation. They found that small molecules called mitochondrial RNA, typically found within the cell's energy-producing mitochondria, can leak into the main part of the cell, where they mistakenly activate antiviral sensors called RIG-I and MDA5 — normally triggered when a virus infects a cell. In this case, the danger signal comes from the cell's own mitochondria, prompting a wave of inflammation that can damage nearby healthy tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the researchers blocked the sensors, inflammation dropped sharply. The study also found that proteins BAX and BAK, which help open pores in the mitochondrial membrane, enable mitochondrial RNA to escape. In a preclinical MASH model, inhibiting BAX and BAK prevented RNA from escaping and was associated with less inflammation and healthier liver tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are 'zombie' cells?</strong></h2>



<p>As we age, some cells enter senescence — a state in which they stop dividing but continue releasing inflammatory and tissue‑damaging molecules. When people are young, the immune system typically eliminates these senescent, or "zombie," cells. With age, however, they can persist and contribute to a range of age‑related health problems and diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some research focuses on removing these cells, this team investigated how to quiet their harmful signals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"With age, we accumulate 'zombie' cells, which can lead to more disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/passos-joao-ph-d/bio-20454365" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">João Passos, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the study. "Our idea is that if we can quiet these cells earlier, we can prevent runaway inflammation and the development of many age‑related conditions, including liver disease. Understanding the mechanisms that drive disease allows us to target and delay those processes — potentially benefiting more than one condition."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Passos and colleagues also are developing new technology to <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1038/s44318-025-00601-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spatially map senescent cells</a> throughout the body during aging.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This research was conducted in partnership between the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/robert-arlene-kogod-center-aging" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging</a> and the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-cell-signaling-gastroenterology-c-sig/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Center for Cell Signaling in Gastroenterology (C-SiG)</a> at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, which is focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Photon radiation therapy, which uses X-rays to cure cancers, is a standard treatment for a type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462">throat cancer</a>&nbsp;called oropharyngeal cancer. Rates of oropharyngeal cancers are increasing in the U.S., mainly driven by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hpv-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20351596">HPV infection</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reducing the toll of treatment</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Proton beam therapy has been used for years in children, where research shows it lowers both short- and long-term treatment-related side effects. "Protons have been studied extensively in pediatric populations and consistently demonstrate reduced short- and long-term toxicity," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/laack-nadia-n-m-d/bio-20054933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nadia Laack, M.D.</a>, chair of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/radiation-oncology/home/orc-20188588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Radiation Oncology</a> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. "It has been more difficult to prove the benefits in adult cancer because many adult studies have not measured side effects as carefully or as long."&nbsp;</p>

<p>To explore whether the same advantages apply to adults, investigators directly compared proton beam therapy with modern photon radiation called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), which precisely targets tumors while limiting exposure to nearby healthy tissue. "It is effective as an oropharyngeal cancer treatment, but there's always some incidental dose to surrounding tissues because of the physical nature of X-rays," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ma-daniel-j-m-d/bio-10031781">Daniel Ma, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic and the Mayo site primary investigator of the study. This incidental dose of radiation can sometimes cause long-term complications, including pain, problems with&nbsp;<a>swallowing</a>&nbsp;and a weakened jawbone.</p>

<p>To alleviate these unwanted side effects, investigators studied proton beam radiation therapy as a treatment option. "Protons are charged particles that can stop at a certain depth, so the delivery is more focused," says Dr. Ma. "If you set up your proton fields thoughtfully, you can avoid irradiating critical structures like the mouth, voice box and swallowing muscles. That's the advantage of proton therapy and why we decided to investigate it within a clinical trial."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic was one of 18 participating institutions around the U.S. that enrolled patients in the first-ever phase 3 randomized trial comparing the two types of radiation for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462">oropharyngeal cancer</a>. Dr. Ma collaborated with Robert Foote, M.D., emeritus professor of radiation oncology at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/patel-samir-h-m-d/bio-20588749">Samir Patel, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic, to help lead Mayo Clinic’s involvement in the study.</p>

<p><br>Study results found that proton beam therapy weakened the immune system by 15% less than photon therapy. It also lowered the risk of severe swallowing problems by 13% and reduced the need for feeding tubes by more than 13%.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An unexpected outcome</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The treatments were similar in effectiveness in controlling cancer growth and spread, so Dr. Ma expected survival to be approximately the same, but the survival results were surprising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Unexpectedly, we found that the overall survival at five years was 91% with proton therapy and 81% with photon therapy," he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These results weren't immediately apparent. "The survival benefit in our study didn't start separating out until three years and wasn't apparent until five years, so longer follow-up with patients was key," he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Ma says this result is likely due to a variety of factors, including less toxicity and immune suppression. He adds, "Because of this, we feel strongly that proton therapy should be a standard treatment for oropharyngeal cancer patients who can tolerate and receive it."&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This study is important because it confirms what we believe to be true in many adult cancer cases: reducing toxicity has a meaningful impact on quality of life and long-term outcomes," says Dr. Laack. "As our treatments improve and our patients live longer, reducing toxicity and improving quality of life is more important than ever."&nbsp;</p>
