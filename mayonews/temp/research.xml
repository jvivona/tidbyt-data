<p><br>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Clinicians typically classify meningiomas — the most common type of brain tumor — into three grades, ranging from slow-growing to aggressive.</p>



<p>But a new multi-institutional study suggests that appearances may be deceiving. If a tumor shows activity in a gene called telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), it tends to recur more quickly, even if it looks low-grade under the microscope.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group is-nowrap is-layout-flex wp-container-core-group-is-layout-6c531013 wp-block-group-is-layout-flex">
<p>The findings, published Sept. 1 in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(25)00267-0/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lancet Oncology</a>, could significantly change how doctors diagnose and treat meningiomas.</p>

<p>"High TERT expression is strongly linked to faster disease progression," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zadeh-gelareh-m-d-ph-d/bio-20579723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gelareh Zadeh, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a neurosurgeon at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and senior author of the study. "This makes it a promising new biomarker for identifying patients who may be at greater risk of developing aggressive disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>An early warning sign</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/meningioma/symptoms-causes/syc-20355643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meningiomas</a> — tumors of the meninges, the protective tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord — are generally considered benign. But a small subset of these tumors has a mutation in the TERT gene, which is linked to faster growth and a shorter time before the tumor returns after treatment.</p>



<p>TERT is the active part of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomeres, the protective ends of chromosomes. In most healthy adult cells, TERT is switched off. But if it becomes switched back on, it can fuel cancer development by driving unchecked cell growth.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers wanted to see whether high TERT expression, even in the absence of the TERT genetic mutation, also predicted worse outcomes. They looked at more than 1,200 meningiomas from patients across Canada, Germany and the U.S., and they found that nearly one-third of them had high TERT expression despite not having the mutation.</p>



<p>These patients had earlier tumor regrowth compared to those without TERT expression, though their outcomes were better than patients with full-blown TERT mutations.</p>



<p>"TERT-positive tumors behaved like they were one grade worse than their official diagnosis," says Dr. Zadeh. "For example, a grade 1 tumor with TERT expression acted more like a grade 2."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Guiding treatment decisions</strong></h2>



<p>The findings suggest that testing for TERT activity could help doctors predict which patients are at higher risk for recurrence and may need closer monitoring or more intensive treatment.</p>



<p>"Because meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor, this biomarker could influence how thousands of patients are diagnosed and managed worldwide," says Dr. Zadeh.</p>

<p>"TERT expression can help us more accurately identify patients with aggressive meningiomas," Chloe Gui, M.D., a neurosurgery resident at the University of Toronto, a Mayo Clinic research collaborator and the study’s lead author, explains on a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/multimedia/podcasts/in-conversation-with/lanonc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast hosted by The Lancet Oncology</a>. "This information allows us to offer treatment tailored to the tumor's behavior."</p>



<p>The team is currently investigating ways to incorporate TERT expression into the clinical workflow. The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study finds that a shortened, less intense course of radiation and chemotherapy after minimally invasive surgery for HPV-positive <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/throat-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20366462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oropharyngeal</a> squamous cell carcinoma (HPV+OPSCC) results in less toxicity, substantially lowering the rates of treatment-related side effects while maintaining high cure rates.

<p>"This is a game-changer for patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ma-daniel-j-m-d/bio-10031781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daniel Ma, M.D.</a>, senior author of the study and head and neck radiation oncologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>. "We've significantly reduced the burden of long-term side effects without compromising the effectiveness of the treatment. This shorter, less intensive regimen allows patients to return to their lives more quickly and with a better quality of life."</p>



<p>Standard treatments for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer typically involve seven weeks of daily radiation and chemotherapy, or surgery followed by six weeks of radiation and chemotherapy. While highly effective, these treatments often lead to significant long-term side effects due to high toxicity, such as jawbone failure, dry mouth, changes in taste and challenges with swallowing. "These greatly affect the quality of life for patients, many of whom are young, in their 40s and 50s," says Dr. Ma.</p>



<p>In the randomized phase 3 study, Mayo Clinic researchers compared the standard treatment to a new approach involving minimally invasive transoral surgery followed by a two-week course of gentler radiation therapy called de-escalated regimen of adjuvant radiotherapy (DART). DART uses about half as much radiation and a reduced dose of chemotherapy, one-fifth of the standard dose.</p>



<p>The results demonstrated that the less intensive treatment approach significantly reduced both severe (grade 3 or higher) and moderate (grade 2) toxicities, indicating fewer adverse events and improved symptom burden for patients following treatment. Importantly, disease control rates were comparable to the standard treatment for intermediate-risk patients.</p>



<p>For specific high-risk patients, namely those with five or more lymph nodes and disease extending outside of the lymph nodes, the standard treatment showed slightly better disease control, potentially due to chemotherapy-related factors rather than radiation. The researchers add that these patients should still receive the standard six-week treatment.</p>



<p>The study involved 228 patients treated at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Arizona. The researchers say that this study represents the largest cohort of postsurgical de-escalation patients in the published literature.</p>



<p>Further, ongoing research will continue to explore using biomarkers such as circulating DNA to find the best patient populations for this treatment strategy.</p>

<p>Dr. Zubair's&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://science.nasa.gov/biological-physical/investigations/microgravity-associated-bone-loss-b-mabl-b/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&amp;nbsp;is one of several science experiments selected by&amp;nbsp;NASA as part of the 33rd SpaceX Commercial Resupply Mission to the International Space Station. </p>



<p>The SpaceX Dragon spacecraft on a Falcon 9 rocket is targeted for&amp;nbsp;2:45 a.m. EDT, Sunday, Aug. 24, from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida.</p>



<p>In addition to the science experiments, the Dragon spacecraft will deliver 5,000 pounds of supplies, including food and equipment to the crew at the orbital laboratory.</p>



<p>"For this project, our goal is to really understand how gravity affects bone formation and bone loss, particularly in relation to mesenchymal stem cells and other bone-forming cells," says Dr. Zubair. </p>

</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>Dr. Zubair believes the research also will provide hope for hundreds of millions of people worldwide affected by osteoporosis, the disease that weakens bones and increases the risk of fractures.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's research also is aimed at improving the health of astronauts. Astronauts lose measurable bone density while living in space. </p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's team has identified a protein in the body called IL-6 that can send signals to stem cells to promote bone formation or bone loss. Dr. Zubair's research will investigate whether a new compound can block IL-6 signals and reduce bone loss while in space.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"If this compound we are testing is able to block the impact of microgravity to slow or stop bone loss, then we can find a treatment for the bone loss in space, and that might also give us a clue into how we may treat people on Earth," says Dr. Zubair.</p>



<p>For more than 20 years, Dr. Zubair has led the Stem Cell Laboratory on Mayo Clinic's Florida campus, developing safe, clinical-grade cell therapy products.&amp;nbsp;His broader research focus aims to harness stem cells&amp;nbsp;to treat degenerative diseases and engineer immune cells to enhance therapeutic outcomes and meet regulatory standards.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's research could potentially advance treatments for brain injury, lung disease, stroke and neurological recovery, cancer, blood stem cell therapies, and epilepsy.</p>



<p>His newest research on bone loss will be his fourth space project selected by NASA at the space station. In recognition of his work, Dr. Zubair received an Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal from NASA.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5khrXRfTrk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">From an early age in Nigeria</a>, Dr. Zubair was captivated by space, spending countless hours gazing at the night sky and dreaming of becoming an astronaut. His work as a physician-scientist conducting research in space to improve humanity allows him the best of both worlds.</p>



<p>"I love it. It will be my fourth time attending a launch at the space center. I always get a thrill and wish I was on that rocket heading out," says Dr. Zubair. "It is an unbelievable experience." </p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="450" height="600" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Evette-Radisky.vert_.crop_.jpg" alt="Portrait of Dr. Evette Radisky" class="wp-image-405578" style="width:270px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Evette-Radisky.vert_.crop_.jpg 450w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Evette-Radisky.vert_.crop_-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Evette Radisky, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Mayo Clinic cancer biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/radisky-evette-s-ph-d/bio-00094471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evette Radisky, Ph.D.</a>, previously found that one trypsin, called mesotrypsin, plays a role in breast, prostate, pancreatic and lung cancer. Like other enzymes, the molecule has an active site that kicks off reactions with other molecules. Researchers have tried to block the active site but haven’t found a molecule with a specific enough lock-and-key fit to jam the active region.</p>



<p>Recently, however, Dr. Radisky's lab at Mayo Clinic in Florida discovered a new way to block mesotrypsin. They found a "hidden pocket" in the molecule.</p>



<p>"The hidden pocket is separate from the active site, but we found that blocking it has a similar effect of locking the enzyme in an inactive state," says Dr. Radisky, principal investigator of the study that appeared in <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adu9129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Advances</a>. The team now is taking steps to discover drugs that fit the hidden pocket.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A mystery in the data</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Coban-Mathew-A._16094085_202109280353.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-405580" style="width:276px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Coban-Mathew-A._16094085_202109280353.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/08/Coban-Mathew-A._16094085_202109280353-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Mathew Coban</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"It was a serendipitous finding," says the study’s lead author, Mathew Coban, of the pocket's discovery. As a research technologist in the Radisky lab and a master's degree student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, Coban had aimed to understand the structure of mesotrypsin through X-ray crystallography.</p>



<p>The complex technique, which records scattered X-rays as shadows, can describe the overall folds of amino acids in the enzyme and suggest complementary molecules that fit like a puzzle. While reviewing the X-ray crystallography results, Coban noticed a segment of the enzyme that looked out of place. The research team thought it might be an error in the data and set the results aside.</p>



<p>But Coban continued to wonder about the strange area. He had the idea to begin looking for alternate nooks in the mesotrypsin enzyme that could potentially contribute to a stable, non-active enzyme.</p>



<p>What Coban found was a site that was hidden. The team dubbed it a "cryptic pocket." The pocket, adjacent to the active site, opened at moments when mesotrypsin stabilized itself. The next step was clear. "If the pocket is there some of the time, maybe a drug would be able to bind at that site and trap the enzyme in its inactive state," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Finding a drug that binds</strong></h2>



<p>The team worked with a colleague, Thomas Caulfield, Ph.D., a former Mayo researcher and drug discovery expert, to conduct a computational screen of potential drug compounds that might fit in the cryptic pocket. They found a single molecule that could bind in the cryptic pocket and inhibit the activity of mesotrypsin.</p>



<p>Importantly, the researchers note, the molecule blocks mesotrypsin selectively, without affecting other trypsins. This could mean less toxicity or fewer side effects for a patient. The finding also means that other cryptic pockets may exist in other trypsin molecules related to cancer, presenting new potential drug targets. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team is continuing to look for drug molecules that fit mesotrypsin even better. "Based on the structural information of mesotrypsin that we have now, we've been able to do more computational prediction to identify additional, more potent compounds that we’re now testing in the laboratory," says Dr. Radisky.</p>



<p>"This has been an important step in the understanding of this key enzyme. Our next steps will be to start testing how well our candidate drug molecules fit the cryptic pocket and block cancer invasion and metastasis in models of disease," she says.</p>



<p><em>The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, Mayo Clinic Medical Scientist Training Program and Department of Energy Office of Science User Facility. &amp;nbsp;The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</em></p>

<p>While doctors are often focused on monitoring the health and vital signs of others, a new study had some tuning in to their own health and vital statistics as well. The results suggest that doing so may offer doctors real benefits to their own well-being, in a scalable way.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Physicians who wore a smartwatch and had access to their personal health data — including information on their heart rate, sleep, breathing patterns and physical activity — reported greater resilience and 54% saw a reduction in the overall odds of burnout compared to those who did not receive a study smartwatch, according to new research <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2837666?resultClick=3">published</a>&amp;nbsp;in JAMA Network Open. Mayo Clinic investigators conducted the study in collaboration with the University of Colorado School of Medicine.</p>

<p>Physician well-being is essential not only to personal health, but also to the quality of care patients receive. It's tied to job performance, patient safety, access to care and workforce sustainability.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why Mayo Clinic and others are prioritizing strategies to strengthen and sustain the well-being of healthcare professionals.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How the smartwatch trial was designed and conducted</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The 12-month trial was conducted at Mayo Clinic and the University of Colorado School of Medicine. It included 184 physicians across specialties such as primary care, surgery, neurology and oncology. Researchers randomly assigned about half of the participants to wear a smartwatch for the full 12 months, while they gave the other half the watch during the study’s second half.</p>



<p>All participants received brief newsletters with general tips on smartwatch use and reminders to sync their devices. These resources aimed to support awareness of the tools and encourage engagement with personal health data.</p>



<p>Physicians in both study groups wore the device more than 70% of the time during the trial. Participants also completed validated well-being surveys at the beginning and end of the study.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Participants could view their health data through a mobile app but were not prompted to take specific actions in response to it. Researchers say even this passive approach may help support well-being.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Designing smarter tools for a healthy workforce</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>The study was co-designed and led by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/athreya-arjun-p-ph-d-m-s/bio-20473903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arjun Athreya, Ph.D.</a>, an electrical and computer engineer in Mayo Clinic's Department of Molecular Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/west-colin-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colin West, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, medical director of Employee Well-Being at Mayo Clinic; and study Principal Investigator <a href="https://coloradosph.cuanschutz.edu/resources/directory/directory-profile/Dyrbye-Liselotte-UCD6004070757" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Liselotte Dyrbye, M.D., M.H.P.E.</a>, senior associate dean for faculty and chief well-being officer at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We're entering an era where wearable technology, when paired with thoughtful design and artificial intelligence methods that use the data, could help personalize well-being strategies in clinical settings," Dr. Athreya says. "This study shows we can support healthcare professionals with passive monitoring digital technologies with innovative engagement strategies to provide potentially helpful data without adding burden to their day."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers say this approach can offer timely support as part of a broader physician well-being strategy.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"While this is an individually focused intervention, it offers an evidence-based way to support physicians in the short term, complementing longer-term efforts aimed at addressing systemic contributors to physician stress," says Dr. Dyrbye.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Caring for caregivers: A vision for the future</strong></h2>



<p>Next steps for the researchers include evaluating long-term outcomes of the smartwatch project. They also plan to explore whether this approach can support other healthcare professionals.</p>



<p>"Advancing care starts with caring for those who deliver it," says Dr. West. "We’re shaping a future where the well-being of our workforce is integral to the care we deliver."&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The Physicians Foundation, Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine, and the University of Colorado School of Medicine partly funded the study.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — The immune system is meant to protect the body from infection and disease. But with age, it can become less capable of doing so. However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have found that some older people maintain "immune youth" – a new term coined by Mayo researchers to explain a young immune system in someone over age 60.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>"We are studying why some individuals have a 'fountain of youth' in their immune systems. We want to learn from them," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/weyand-cornelia-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-20527870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornelia Weyand, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic rheumatologist and clinician-scientist. She is a lead author on a perspective paper published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00919-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Aging</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Weyand's research team discovered this cellular fountain of youth in more than 100 older patients who came to Mayo Clinic to receive treatment for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/rheumatology/sections/overview/ovc-20477132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune disease</a> that affects the arteries, including the aorta, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant cell arteritis</a>. Dr. Weyand and colleagues found in the diseased tissue of these patients specialized immune cells, called stem-like T cells. These immune cells behave like young stem cells that usually regenerate and aid healing and growth; but in this case, they were spreading the disease. This team of researchers also discovered <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.adh0380?af=R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune stem cells</a> in humans previously.</p>



<p>"We observed that these patients have very young immune systems despite being in their 60s and 70s. But the price they pay for that is autoimmunity," she says.</p>



<p>Autoimmunity is when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues and organs.</p>



<p>In addition, the researchers saw that the immune checkpoint inhibitors that regulate the immune system were not working properly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits of immune system aging</strong></h2>



<p>"Contrary to what one may think, there are benefits to having an immune system that ages in tandem with the body," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goronzy-jorg-m-d-ph-d/bio-20527076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jörg Goronzy, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher on aging who is a co-lead author of the paper. "We need to consider the price to pay for immune youthfulness. That price can be autoimmune disease."</p>



<p>Immune aging is a sophisticated adaptation mechanism that the immune system can use to prevent autoimmune disease, say the researchers.</p>



<p>They are in the process of developing new diagnostic tests that will help find patients and healthy individuals who carry high numbers of immune stem cells and may be predisposed to autoimmune disease later in life. The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.</p>

<p>Changes in how brain cells generate energy may drive the development of Alzheimer's disease and influence how patients respond to therapy, according to a new study from Mayo Clinic researchers. The findings, published in the journal <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/alz.70519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's &amp;amp; Dementia</a>, spotlight mitochondrial complex I — a critical component of cellular energy production — as both a contributor to disease progression and a promising target for new treatments.</p>

<p>Led by senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/trushina-eugenia-ph-d/bio-00027310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eugenia Trushina, Ph.D.</a>, the Mayo Clinic team found that disruptions in complex I activity can trigger gene expression patterns commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease. The researchers demonstrated that using small molecules to gently adjust how complex I functions can help activate protective mechanisms in brain cells.</p>



<p>"This research offers new clues about how Alzheimer’s begins and shows a promising new path for developing better, more personalized treatments," says Dr. Trushina, a researcher who studies neurodegenerative diseases.</p>



<p>Mitochondria, often described as the powerhouse of the cell, produces the energy necessary for proper cellular function. In neurons, which have especially high energy demands, mitochondrial dysfunction can have devastating consequences. The Mayo Clinic researchers found that when complex I is not working properly, it disrupts how brain cells manage energy and respond to stress — changes that resemble those seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>



<p>Using experimental models and advanced molecular and computational tools, the team showed that mild modulation of complex I activity with specially designed small molecules helped neurons launch protective responses, such as reducing inflammation and improving energy balance.</p>



<p>Interestingly, they found that males and females responded differently to these treatments, suggesting a need for sex-specific approaches to therapy. "This sex-dependent effect is intriguing," says Dr. Trushina. "It suggests that future therapies could be tailored by sex, especially for a disease like Alzheimer's that affects men and women differently."</p>



<p>Current Alzheimer's treatments mostly focus on managing symptoms or targeting hallmark brain changes such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles. However, these approaches have seen limited success in halting disease progression. The new study points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible upstream trigger — one that may begin long before cognitive symptoms emerge.</p>



<p>"This study gives us a deeper understanding of the cellular events that spark Alzheimer's and, more importantly, how we might intervene to slow or prevent its progression," says Dr. Trushina. "Our results open the door to a new class of drugs that work by protecting the brain's energy supply and buffering it against early disease-related changes."</p>



<p>The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions. In the future, the team plans to further investigate the safety and effectiveness of complex I modulators in preclinical models, with the goal of advancing into clinical trials.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Scientific breakthroughs in one disease don't always shed light on treating other diseases. But that's been the surprising journey of one <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> research team. After identifying a sugar molecule that cancer cells use on their surfaces to hide from the immune system, the researchers have found the same molecule may eventually help in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 1 diabetes</a> is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system errantly attacks pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. The disease is caused by genetic and other factors and affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the U.S.</p>



<p>In their studies, the Mayo Clinic researchers took a cancer mechanism and turned it on its head. Cancer cells use a variety of methods to evade immune response, including coating themselves in a sugar molecule known as sialic acid. The researchers found in a preclinical model of type 1 diabetes that it's possible to dress up beta cells with the same sugar molecule, enabling the immune system to tolerate the cells.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="800" height="534" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/VirginiaShapiropreferredportrait-002.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-405173" style="width:386px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/VirginiaShapiropreferredportrait-002.jpg 800w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/VirginiaShapiropreferredportrait-002-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/VirginiaShapiropreferredportrait-002-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Virginia Shapiro, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"Our findings show that it's possible to engineer beta cells that do not prompt an immune response," says immunology researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shapiro-virginia-m-ph-d/bio-00097048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia Shapiro, Ph.D.</a>, principal investigator of the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/181207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, published&nbsp;in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Dr. Shapiro's team demonstrated that an enzyme, known as ST8Sia6, that increases sialic acid on the surface of tumor cells helps tumor cells appear as though they are not foreign entities to be targeted by the immune system. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The expression of this enzyme basically ‘sugar coats' cancer cells and can help protect an abnormal cell from a normal immune response. We wondered if the same enzyme might also protect a normal cell from an abnormal immune response," Dr. Shapiro says. The team <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jimmunol/article/204/12/3071/7944033?searchresult=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first established</a> proof of concept in an artificially-induced model of diabetes.</p>



<p>In the current study, the team looked at preclinical models that are known for the spontaneous development of autoimmune (type 1) diabetes, most closely approximating the process that occurs in patients. Researchers engineered beta cells in the models to produce the ST8Sia6 enzyme.</p>



<p>In the preclinical models, the team found that the engineered cells were 90% effective in preventing the development of type 1 diabetes. The beta cells that are typically destroyed by the immune system in type 1 diabetes were preserved.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Choe-Justin-J._20714963_20220614.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-405177" style="width:282px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Choe-Justin-J._20714963_20220614.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/Choe-Justin-J._20714963_20220614-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Justin Choe</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Importantly, the researchers also found the immune response to the engineered cells appears to be highly specific, says M.D.-Ph.D. student Justin Choe, first author of the publication. Choe conducted the study in the Ph.D. component of his dual degree at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/medical-scientist-training-program-md-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> and <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>"Though the beta cells were spared, the immune system remained intact," Choe says. The researchers were able to see active B- and T-cells and evidence of an autoimmune response against another disease process. "We found that the enzyme specifically generated tolerance against autoimmune rejection of the beta cell, providing local and quite specific protection against type 1 diabetes."</p>



<p>No cure currently exists for type 1 diabetes, and treatment involves using synthetic insulin to regulate blood sugar, or, for some people, undergoing a transplant of pancreatic islet cells, which include the much-needed beta cells. Because transplantation involves immunosuppression of the entire immune system, Dr. Shapiro aims to explore using the engineered beta cells in transplantable islet cells with the goal of ultimately improving therapy for patients.</p>



<p>"A goal would be to provide transplantable cells without the need for immunosuppression," says Dr. Shapiro. "Though we're still in the early stages, this study may be one step toward improving care."</p>



<p>The research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p><em>Researchers are leading the nation in using powerful and precise radioactive drugs to treat people with complex cancers. &amp;nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> has treated the first person in the U.S. using a novel radioactive medicine for advanced breast cancer as part of an international multisite <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>.</p>



<p>The medicine used in this clinical trial contains actinium-225, a highly potent alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy that was first developed for a subtype of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which are rare and can form in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract. The alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy is intended to work by passing through the blood to stick to cancer cells, delivering powerful and precise radiation without harming healthy cells.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic researchers are the first to apply this therapy in America to a patient with metastatic breast cancer. The phase 1b/2 open-label trial is being conducted at all three academic Mayo Clinic sites in Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix; Jacksonville, Florida; and approximately 20 other sites across the U.S. The first person treated was at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>

<p>The principal investigator at Mayo Clinic is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoffrey Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a professor of radiology and a leader in radiopharmaceutical therapies. He says these are innovative cancer treatments that use radioactive medicines designed to target and kill cancer cells with high precision.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has nearly 20 active radiopharmaceutical therapy clinical trials, with 10 more preparing to launch, targeting many different types of cancer. Mayo Clinic in Rochester treats more patients with modern radiopharmaceutical therapies, such as lutetium dotatate for neuroendocrine cancers and lutetium PSMA for prostate cancers, than any other center in the world.</p>



<p>Lutetium dotatate and lutetium PSMA are beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals. They use beta particles, which are tiny subatomic particles, to radiate at a low level. In contrast, alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals use alpha particles that are 8,000 times more massive than beta particles, and travel only three cell diameters after they are emitted from the therapy.</p>



<p>"This means alpha emitters can deliver a much more powerful impact over a shorter distance. If you consider killing a cancer cell is like knocking down a brick wall, then the difference is like throwing a 10-pound dumbbell (beta) at the wall versus a fully loaded Mack truck (alpha)," says Dr. Johnson. "The alpha emitter's potential lies in its power and in its ability to precisely kill even a single cancer cell without injuring surrounding healthy tissue, making it a next-generation therapy."</p>

<p>Deep inside the body, a slow-growing cluster of mutated blood cells can form. This cluster, found in 1 in 5 older adults, can raise the risk of leukemia and heart disease, often without warning.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To better understand this hidden risk, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to help investigators uncover how it contributes to disease risk and progression. </p>



<p>In a study <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fgpb%2Fadvance-article%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fgpbjnl%2Fqzaf040%2F8121950&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CMurphy.Susan%40mayo.edu%7C05f57239f813422ca87008ddc97a7be3%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638888250101337358%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=EEqrric0Eslg1ajqpP60TW69EXgCPyIzcLJp5GRxa4Q%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Genomics, Proteomics &amp;amp; Bioinformatics, the tool showed promising results in identifying early signs of this condition, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/clonal-hematopoiesis-clinic-stratifies-risk-for-patients-with-cancer/mac-20543180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential</a>, or CHIP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When blood cells mutate</strong></h2>



<p>CHIP starts in the bone marrow, where blood stem cells make the cells that keep organs working, oxygen flowing and the immune system strong. But if one of those cells acquires a mutation in a gene linked to blood cancer, it can multiply abnormally, forming a cluster of mutated cells that gradually expands.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This can cause CHIP, a condition with no symptoms that researchers link to higher rates of death, especially from heart disease. Because its effects vary, CHIP is hard to track and often goes undetected for years.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>CHIP makes leukemia more than 10 times more likely and raises the risk of heart disease up to four times, even in healthy adults. Finding it earlier could help guide proactive monitoring or preventive care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new tool for early detection</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new tool, called UNISOM — short for UNIfied SOmatic calling and Machine learning — was developed by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tian-shulan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20524328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shulan Tian, Ph.D.</a>, under the leadership of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, co-senior author of the study and the Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director of Research and Innovation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>UNISOM helps clinicians identify CHIP-related mutations in standard genetic datasets, opening new avenues for research and discovery. In the past, that level of detection required more complex and advanced sequencing methods.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Detecting disease at its earliest molecular roots is one of the most meaningful advances we can make in medicine," says Dr. Klee. "UNISOM is just one of many examples of how we're translating genomic science into innovative tools that support timely and informed care."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>UNISOM helped researchers detect nearly 80% of CHIP mutations using whole-exome sequencing, which analyzes the protein-coding regions of DNA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also tested UNISOM on whole-genome sequencing data from the Mayo Clinic Biobank, which captures nearly all of a person's genetic code. In that data, it detected early signs of CHIP, including mutations present in fewer than 5% of blood cells. Standard techniques often miss these small but important changes.</p>



<p>"We're engineering a path from genomic discovery to clinical decision-making," says Dr. Tian, the co-senior author and a bioinformatician at Mayo Clinic. "It's rewarding to help bring these discoveries closer to clinical care, where they can inform decisions and support more precise treatment."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to apply UNISOM to larger and more diverse datasets to support research and expand its use in clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;</p>
