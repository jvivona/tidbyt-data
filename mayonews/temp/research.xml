<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers and collaborators have identified a previously unrecognized way lung tumors weaken the immune system, helping explain why many patients do not respond to immunotherapy and pointing to a potential new approach to make those treatments more effective.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/cancerimmunolres/article/doi/10.1158/2326-6066.CIR-25-0567/771882/Regulatory-T-cell-sensing-of-extracellular-ATP-via" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cancer Immunology Research</a>, focuses on regulatory T cells, immune cells that normally keep the immune system from becoming overactive. In <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>, researchers found these same cells can be redirected to protect the tumor instead of the body.</p>



<p>"What we are seeing is the tumor taking advantage of a normal immune safety mechanism and turning it to its own benefit," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/borges-da-silva-henrique-ph-d/bio-20492923" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Henrique Borges da Silva, Ph.D.</a>, an immunologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a> and senior author of the study. "The same cells that normally prevent immune damage are instead protecting the tumor."</p>



<p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Although immunotherapies have improved outcomes for some patients, many tumors continue to grow because immune cells cannot function effectively inside the tumor environment.</p>



<p>To better understand why, the researchers analyzed patient data from non-small cell lung cancer. They found that regulatory T cells inside lung tumors expressed high levels of P2RX7, and higher P2RX7 expression was linked to worse survival outcomes.</p>



<p>P2RX7 allows regulatory T cells to sense ATP, a molecule released by stressed cells and commonly found at high levels inside tumors. When these cells detect ATP, they accumulate within lung tumors and suppress immune cells that would otherwise attack the cancer.</p>



<p>When P2RX7 was removed from regulatory T cells, lung tumors grew more slowly because the immune system was less suppressed. Immune cells that attack cancer were able to move into tumors more easily and were more active.</p>



<p>The study also found that P2RX7 helps regulatory T cells produce CTLA-4, a molecule that dampens immune responses. Without P2RX7, these regulatory cells were less effective at shutting down immune activity inside lung tumors.</p>



<p>Blocking P2RX7 also helped immune cells work more closely with B cells. This led to higher levels of antibodies that target tumors and to the formation of organized immune cell groups inside tumors, which have been associated with better outcomes in lung cancer.</p>



<p>"If we want immunotherapy to reach more patients, we have to understand why it fails," Dr. Borges da Silva says. "This study identifies one of the mechanisms standing in the way."</p>



<p>The researchers also tested a drug that inhibits P2RX7. They found that the inhibitor developed smaller lung tumors in models and had fewer regulatory T cells inside the tumors. While the drug is not yet approved for cancer treatment, the findings suggest it could one day be used alongside existing immunotherapies.</p>



<p>Researchers say more studies are needed before the findings can be tested in patients, but the work highlights how targeting immune suppression inside tumors could help make cancer treatments more effective.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A medication commonly used to treat overactive bladder significantly reduced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hot-flashes/symptoms-causes/syc-20352790" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hot flashes</a> in men receiving hormone therapy for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a>, according to a study published in the <a href="https://ascopubs.org/doi/full/10.1200/JCO-25-01486" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a> which included several <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers.</p>



<p>The phase 2 study found that oxybutynin, a medication commonly prescribed to treat overactive bladder, worked better than a placebo at reducing how often hot flashes occurred and how intense they were in men receiving hormone therapy for prostate cancer. Men who took oxybutynin also reported improvements in their day-to-day functioning and overall quality of life.</p>



<p>Hot flashes affect an estimated 60% to 80% of men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy and can interfere with sleep, mood and overall well-being. For some patients, these symptoms are severe enough to make it difficult to continue treatment.</p>

</div>


<p>"Hot flashes are often underestimated in men, but they can have a real and lasting impact on quality of life during prostate cancer treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/stish-brad-j-m-d/bio-20340352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Stish, M.D.</a>, a radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study. "This trial shows that oxybutynin can provide significant relief with a favorable safety profile."</p>



<p>The study enrolled 88 men with prostate cancer who were experiencing frequent hot flashes while receiving androgen-deprivation therapy. Participants were randomly assigned to receive oxybutynin at one of two doses or a placebo for six weeks.</p>



<p>Men who received the higher dose of oxybutynin experienced the greatest benefit, with an average reduction of nearly seven hot flashes per day, compared with about two fewer hot flashes per day in the placebo group. More than 75% of men receiving the higher dose achieved at least a 50% reduction in hot flash severity.</p>



<p>Patients taking oxybutynin also reported less disruption to sleep, work, social activities and overall quality of life. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred during the study. The most common side effect was dry mouth, which was more frequent at higher doses.</p>



<p>Oxybutynin has previously been shown to reduce hot flashes in women, but evidence in men had been limited. This trial is among the first randomized, placebo-controlled study to demonstrate its effectiveness for men receiving androgen-deprivation therapy.</p>



<p>"These results expand the options available to clinicians and patients who are trying to manage a challenging side effect of prostate cancer treatment," says Dr. Stish. "Having additional, well-tolerated choices matters."</p>



<p>Researchers note that larger studies will be needed to confirm the findings and determine the optimal dose, but the results support the use of oxybutynin as a treatment option for men with bothersome hot flashes related to hormone therapy.</p>



<p>The study was conducted through the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, part of the National Cancer Institute's National Clinical Trial Network. It included participants from academic and community cancer centers across the U.S. Mayo Clinic has a financial interest in the technology referenced in this news release. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.</p>

<p>When Karen Koellner reached for her phone charger while in bed one night, she felt pain. Curious, she got up and went to her bathroom mirror to check — and her instinct told her something was definitely wrong. She found a lump in her armpit and knew it might be cancer.</p>



<p>The next day, she called her doctor, who referred her to Mayo Clinic's Arizona campus. Fear set in as she expected to wait days before getting an appointment.</p>



<p>Instead, she received a call within two hours.</p>



<p>Manual processes and paperwork are often part of healthcare, but these tasks can take valuable time away from patient care. They can also delay care for patients who need it most.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="973" height="973" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Koellner-1x1-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-410646" style="width:405px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Koellner-1x1-1.jpg 973w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Koellner-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Koellner-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/02/Karen-Koellner-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 973px) 100vw, 973px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Karen Koellner</figcaption></figure>
</div>


<p>That is beginning to change.</p>



<p>Intelligent automation helps Mayo Clinic move faster and smarter. A new automation initiative is already improving the experience for patients like Karen, who was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. An intelligent referral processing system flagged her case as urgent based on clinical patterns, prompting staff to reach out right away. Her appointments were scheduled across multiple specialties the next day, with care teams coordinating across states, disciplines and workflows.</p>



<p>"Being seen by an oncologist quickly was important to me," Karen says. "I was able to move forward with a treatment plan rather than waiting and worrying about the unknown." </p>



<p>The automated document referral system was developed at Mayo Clinic to triage incoming patient referrals using generative artificial intelligence (AI) in place of faxes, which had to be processed by hand. By eliminating one of the most time-consuming administrative workflows, the system shortens referral timelines and strengthens coordination across care teams. That means staff can spend more time focused on patients — and anxious patients like Karen experience less of a wait during the critical time between diagnosis and their first appointment.</p>



<p>"That is a crucial time period for patients with serious and complex medical conditions, when every moment truly matters," says Erin Layman, operations manager for Hematology and Medical Oncology at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. "It's important to have an intelligent system that can pull information from multiple documents, summarize it and allow staff to quickly review for accuracy. That helps move high-risk patients through the process much faster."</p>



<p>Karen calls it a game-changer in healthcare.</p>



<p>"Automation for patients with time-sensitive, critical diseases such as cancer has the potential to save lives by getting treatment plans started as soon as possible," she says.</p>



<p>The system, used in multiple departments across Mayo Clinic, worked to Karen’s advantage. Now finished with her treatment, she says she's feeling much better and is grateful to be cancer-free.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scitranslmed.adt8706" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers suggests that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20375941" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cancer</a> cells quickly activate a survival response after PARP inhibitor treatment, and blocking this early response may make this class of drugs work better.</p>



<p>PARP inhibitors are a common treatment for ovarian cancer and can be especially effective in cancers with impaired DNA repair. However, many tumors eventually stop responding, even when the drugs initially show results. The new research identifies a way cancer cells may survive PARP inhibitor treatment early on, and it points to a potential strategy to block that response.</p>



<p>In the study, researchers found that ovarian cancer cells rapidly activate a pro-survival program after exposure to PARP inhibitors. A key driver of this response is FRA1, a transcription factor that helps turn on genes that allow cancer cells to adapt and avoid cell death.</p>



<p>"This work shows that drug resistance does not always emerge slowly over time — cancer cells can activate survival programs very early after treatment begins," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kanakkanthara-arun-ph-d/bio-20445738" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arun Kanakkanthara, Ph.D.</a>, an oncology investigator at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. "By targeting that early response, we may be able to improve how well existing therapies work and potentially delay or prevent resistance."</p>



<p>The research team tested whether brigatinib, an FDA-approved drug currently used to treat certain lung cancers, could block this survival response and enhance the effects of PARP inhibitors. Brigatinib was selected because of its ability to inhibit multiple signaling pathways involved in cancer cell survival.</p>



<p>The results showed that combining brigatinib with a PARP inhibitor was more effective than either treatment alone. Importantly, this effect was seen only in cancer cells, not in normal cells, suggesting the potential for a more targeted and safer treatment approach.</p>



<p>Surprisingly, the researchers discovered that brigatinib helps in a completely new way. Rather than acting through traditional DNA repair pathways, brigatinib shuts down two key signaling molecules, FAK and EPHA2, that aggressive ovarian cancer cells rely on to survive. Blocking both signals at once weakened the cancer cells' ability to adapt and resist treatment, leaving them far more vulnerable to PARP inhibitors.</p>



<p>The researchers also found a potential clue for identifying which patients might benefit most from this treatment. Tumors with higher levels of the signaling molecules FAK and EPHA2 responded better to the drug combination. Other data suggest that ovarian cancers with high levels of these molecules are often more aggressive, highlighting the promise of this approach for harder-to-treat cases.</p>



<p>"From a clinical perspective, resistance remains one of the biggest challenges in treating ovarian cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/weroha-john-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Weroha, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a medical oncologist at Mayo Clinic and a senior author of the study. "By combining mechanistic insights from Dr. Kanakkanthara's laboratory with my clinical experience, this preclinical work supports the strategy of targeting resistance early, before it has a chance to take hold. This strategy could improve patient outcomes."</p>



<p>This research sheds new light on how ovarian cancer evades treatment, and it points to a promising strategy for improving patient outcomes.</p>

Listen as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/rajkumar-s-vincent-m-d/bio-00085953" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr.&nbsp;Vincent Rajkumar</a>,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mayo Clinic hematologist and oncologist&nbsp;and an associate editor for the journal,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/nath-karl-a-m-b-ch-b-m-d/bio-00027413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Karl Nath</a>,&nbsp;a&nbsp;Mayo Clinic nephrologist&nbsp;and&nbsp;current editor,&nbsp;as they talk about the journal's 100 years of history and its future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Prior to its early format as an internal newsletter, the Mayo brothers&nbsp;hired&nbsp;<a href="https://history.mayoclinic.org/books-films/heritage-films/maud-mellish-wilson-a-singular-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maud Mellish Wilson</a>&nbsp;to serve as librarian&nbsp;and organizer of editorial materials in&nbsp;1907.&nbsp;Around 1919, she began taking notes at a recurring weekly meeting to discuss discoveries.&nbsp;That meeting grew with the&nbsp;clinic,&nbsp;and consultants began to travel to other places to learn and discuss medicine.&nbsp;As faculty grew, the inability to gather them all in one meeting&nbsp;sparked&nbsp;the development of the Bulletin of the Mayo Foundation,&nbsp;which&nbsp;evolved into a full-fledged journal in 1926.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The editors talk with host&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mprnews.org/people/cathy-wurzer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cathy Wurzer</a>&nbsp;about the value of peer-reviewed research and experts in a field gathering to encourage and debate scientific progress.&nbsp;"We&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take ourselves with a lot of caution and seriousness because once&nbsp;it's&nbsp;published in the&nbsp;Mayo Clinic Proceedings&nbsp;with the Mayo brand, it carries a certain level of trust," says&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Rajkumar.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The podcast also explores what future iterations of scientific journals could look like and how they&nbsp;engage&nbsp;social media, including a new Fellowship in Training Editors program the group could introduce as early as this year. Advances in AI, digital&nbsp;health&nbsp;and more will continue to change the mechanics of journals. Mayo Clinic Proceedings is already using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MayoProceedings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTube</a>&nbsp;to its advantage.&nbsp;"(Social media)&nbsp;is&nbsp;a roadmap for communication for humanity in whatever form or setting," says Dr.&nbsp;Nath.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this conversation, the editors also talk about the breakthrough research first published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings from using viruses to treat cancer to&nbsp;a platelet-derived exosome product that affects tissues and promotes healing.

<p><br><strong>Why is epilepsy such a challenging condition to treat?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Epilepsy affects people across the entire lifespan, from infancy through older adulthood. About one-third of patients continue to have seizures despite medication. Many also experience&nbsp;disabling&nbsp;comorbidities such as sleep disturbances, memory&nbsp;problems&nbsp;and mood disorders. Treating epilepsy effectively requires addressing all&nbsp;of these challenges, not just seizures alone.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How does a team-based approach improve epilepsy care?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Addressing epilepsy requires collaboration across many specialties, including&nbsp;basic neuroscience, engineering,&nbsp;neurology, neurosurgery,&nbsp;neuroradiology&nbsp;and psychiatry. By combining&nbsp;expertise&nbsp;and&nbsp;leveraging&nbsp;advances in biology, imaging,&nbsp;engineering,&nbsp;computing&nbsp;and artificial intelligence, we can better meet the complex and unmet needs of patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is the&nbsp;Bioelectronics Neuromodulation Innovation to Cure&nbsp;(BIONIC)&nbsp;Initiative, and why is it important for epilepsy care?</strong>&nbsp;<br>The BIONIC&nbsp;initiative is focused on changing the course of epilepsy therapy and diagnostics.&nbsp;We're&nbsp;in&nbsp;a period of rapid technological acceleration — advances in artificial intelligence, neurotechnology, computing and connected devices. These tools allow us to deliver and adjust therapies in real time and to receive feedback from people with epilepsy as they go about their daily lives. This creates new opportunities to better understand epilepsy, create new&nbsp;therapies&nbsp;and improve patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do these technologies help people living with epilepsy day to day?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Today, we can track seizures as well as common&nbsp;epilepsy-related&nbsp;comorbidities such as sleep problems, memory&nbsp;issues&nbsp;and mood disorders. Importantly, we can also intervene using neuromodulation&nbsp;using&nbsp;electrical&nbsp;brain&nbsp;stimulation,&nbsp;to help suppress seizures and improve these comorbidities. This&nbsp;technology&nbsp;allows care to extend beyond the clinic and into a patient's home.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What kinds of devices are being developed through BIONIC?</strong>&nbsp;<br>We're&nbsp;developing&nbsp;a&nbsp;next-generation neuromodulation&nbsp;platform with&nbsp;devices that are fully implantable&nbsp;and integrated with wearables and computing. These devices include electrodes placed in the brain and have sensing capabilities that allow continuous recording of brain activity. The data can be securely transmitted through a handheld device to the cloud. The system enables analysis that can guide therapy&nbsp;and&nbsp;drive&nbsp;better&nbsp;understanding of&nbsp;seizures and related conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What can clinicians and researchers learn from this brain data?</strong>&nbsp;<br>By continuously recording brain activity, we can track seizures, sleep patterns,&nbsp;memory&nbsp;and mood. This data allows us to adjust electrical therapies in a more personalized way.&nbsp;Ultimately, our&nbsp;goal is to forecast seizures before they happen and deliver adaptive therapies that&nbsp;prevent&nbsp;seizures&nbsp;before they occur&nbsp;and address the broader impact of epilepsy on daily life.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do these new devices compare to earlier generations?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Earlier devices were groundbreaking for their time, but they had fewer capabilities. The devices&nbsp;we're&nbsp;preparing for clinical trials are significantly smaller, more powerful,&nbsp;rechargeable&nbsp;and offer expanded&nbsp;stimulation,&nbsp;sensing&nbsp;and streaming capabilities. This&nbsp;represents&nbsp;a major step forward in both technology and patient experience.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is the long-term vision of the BIONIC Initiative?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Our vision is to build more effective therapies, prevent seizures before they&nbsp;occur&nbsp;and directly target comorbidities. With current&nbsp;newly developed&nbsp;technologies, these goals are now achievable, and BIONIC is focused on translating them into real-world patient benefits.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Why is collaboration beyond Mayo Clinic essential?</strong>&nbsp;<br>These challenges&nbsp;can't&nbsp;be solved by one person or one institution alone. Collaboration with other academic centers, industry&nbsp;partners&nbsp;and most importantly,&nbsp;patients is essential. A technology that&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;have a clear path to commercialization, even if&nbsp;it's&nbsp;innovative, will&nbsp;likely&nbsp;only&nbsp;help a&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;small&nbsp;number of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do patients factor into the development of these therapies?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Partnering with patients is critical. We need to understand what matters most to them&nbsp;and&nbsp;what they need to improve their quality of life. Their input helps guide technology development&nbsp;so that it truly addresses real-world needs.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is the&nbsp;ultimate goal&nbsp;of BIONIC?</strong>&nbsp;<br>The goal of BIONIC is to bring&nbsp;all of&nbsp;these elements together into a unified effort to create the future of epilepsy therapy — one that is more personalized,&nbsp;proactive&nbsp;and focused on the whole patient.&nbsp;It is important to realize that&nbsp;the neuromodulation&nbsp;technologies developed for epilepsy will have&nbsp;a&nbsp;wide impact on many other diseases of the brain and mind.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><strong>###&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A single treatment of the gene therapy slowed kidney cyst growth, improved heart and liver health, and extended survival in preclinical models of ADPKD. The findings were <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-65997-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Nature Communications.</p>

<p>"This is the first time we've been able to show that base editing can effectively and safely correct a disease-causing mutation in the kidney in a complex biological system," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/li-xiaogang-ph-d/bio-20453268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiaogang Li, Ph.D.</a>, nephrology researcher and senior author of the study. "Instead of managing symptoms, this strategy goes after the underlying cause of the disease."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/polycystic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352820?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;cjevent=71874690e9d911f082ee0b1f0a82b836&amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-100357191-_-5250933-_-Evergreen+Link+for+Mayo+Clinic+Diet&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;utm_content=100357191&amp;utm_capaign=3-months" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ADPKD</a> affects an estimated 12 million people worldwide. The disease is caused primarily by mutations in the PKD1 or PKD2 genes and leads to the progressive growth of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, often resulting in kidney failure. Many patients also develop complications outside the kidneys, including heart enlargement and liver disease.</p>



<p>Current treatments can slow disease progression but do not address its genetic root. The new approach, developed by Mayo Clinic investigators, uses a form of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-the-gene-editing-tool-crispr-explained/?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;cjevent=b0050e8de9d811f082600abd0a82b821&amp;cm_mmc=CJ-_-100357191-_-5250933-_-Evergreen+Link+for+Mayo+Clinic+Diet&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;utm_content=100357191&amp;utm_capaign=3-months" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CRISPR-based gene editing</a> known as base editing to precisely correct a single-letter DNA mutation in the PKD1 gene.</p>



<p>In the study, researchers engineered two versions of a base editor: one designed to work broadly across multiple organs and another tailored specifically to kidney cells. Delivered using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, a single dose of the therapy corrected the PKD1 mutation in a significant proportion of cells in kidney tissue and, depending on the editor used, in the heart and liver as well.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="250" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/4250422-001-0-72ppi-300x250.jpg" alt="Illustration of a healthy kidney and a polycystic kidney" class="wp-image-409981" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/4250422-001-0-72ppi-300x250.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2026/01/4250422-001-0-72ppi.jpg 632w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure>
</div>


<p>Preclinical models treated early in life had significantly reduced kidney cyst growth, better kidney function, less heart enlargement, improved liver health and longer survival. Importantly, the researchers found no evidence of harmful off-target genetic changes or significant immune reactions.</p>



<p>"Our results suggest this could one day be a treatment that meaningfully changes the course of disease," Dr. Li says. "That is fundamentally different from lifelong therapies that only slow progression."</p>



<p>The kidney has historically been difficult to target with gene-editing therapies. This study provides the first in vivo evidence that base editing can work efficiently in kidney tissue, opening the door to similar approaches for other inherited kidney diseases.</p>



<p>The research team also demonstrated that kidney-specific gene editing can limit genetic changes to the intended organ, a strategy that may enhance safety as therapies move closer to human testing.</p>



<p>"Being able to precisely control where editing happens is critical," Dr. Li says. "It allows us to maximize benefit while minimizing risk."<strong></strong></p>



<p>The work advances Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative, which aims to prevent organ failure and restore function through regenerative medicine, precision genomics and advanced therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ongoing studies are focused on refining base-editing tools to address a broader range of PKD mutations, evaluating whether treatment can be effective after cysts have already formed, and developing alternative delivery methods — including nonviral options such as nanoparticles — to support future clinical use.</p>



<p>"If these approaches translate successfully to humans, they could reduce or even eliminate the need for chronic medication, delay kidney failure and significantly improve quality of life for patients with ADPKD," Dr. Li says.</p>

Featuring&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/davis-john-m-iii-m-d/bio-00027697" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. John Davis, III</a>, Mayo Clinic rheumatologist and Dr. Kevin Deane, University of Colorado rheumatologist, the episode highlights how early‑stage research and emerging technologies are reshaping&nbsp;what's&nbsp;possible in rheumatoid arthritis care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;is an autoimmune condition that affects far more than joints. Crucially, researchers now know that autoantibodies,&nbsp;such as anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti‑CCP)&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/rheumatoid-factor/about/pac-20384800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rheumatoid factor</a>,&nbsp;often develop years before diagnosis, signaling early immune system disruption.&nbsp;</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Traditional blood tests&nbsp;predict&nbsp;future&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;only&nbsp;about 30% of the time&nbsp;—&nbsp;too uncertain for preventive treatment. To close this gap, researchers&nbsp;turn&nbsp;to AI and&nbsp;multisource&nbsp;data&nbsp;such as genetic information, lifestyle and environmental exposures, microbiome patterns, imaging and clinical records,&nbsp;and wearable health metrics.&nbsp;AI can piece together complex risk profiles that traditional methods&nbsp;can't, helping&nbsp;identify&nbsp;individuals most likely to develop the disease and when.&nbsp;</p>



<p>New evidence suggests&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;may start at mucosal surfaces&nbsp;such&nbsp;as the lungs,&nbsp;gut&nbsp;or gums&nbsp;before affecting joints. Environmental factors&nbsp;such as&nbsp;smoke,&nbsp;pollution&nbsp;and airborne particles may play a role in triggering early immune activation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, the gut microbiome is&nbsp;emerging&nbsp;as a powerful predictor of both&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;risk and treatment response. Certain bacteria influence inflammation and can even&nbsp;metabolize medications such as methotrexate, affecting how well patients respond.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the next decade, experts&nbsp;anticipate&nbsp;transformative shifts in rheumatology,&nbsp;including more precise biomarkers and antibody panels;&nbsp;AI-guided prediction tools that can lead to personalized, data-driven treatment plans;&nbsp;expanded virtual care options to increase access;&nbsp;and a deeper understanding of environmental and immune triggers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I think this is where we need to go&nbsp;… trying to put together a lot of data that we can digitize about an individual,&nbsp;such as&nbsp;health, risk factors, behaviors, even wearable data,&nbsp;and analyze it&nbsp;using AI to identify people who could be at risk long before symptoms appear,"&nbsp;Dr.&nbsp;Davis&nbsp;says. The long‑term goal is clear:&nbsp;identify&nbsp;rheumatoid arthritis&nbsp;before joint damage occurs&nbsp;and&nbsp;ultimately prevent&nbsp;the disease altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A new international study — believed to be the largest of its kind — examined what people know about perimenopause and what symptoms they experience. The results reveal a clear gap between what perimenopause symptoms people expect and what they experience.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers published a collaborative research <a href="https://journals.lww.com/menopausejournal/fulltext/9900/global_perspectives_on_perimenopause__a_digital.602.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> with Flo, a women's health application, to assess the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perimenopause</a> symptoms of 17,494 people from 158 countries. The study results are published in <a href="https://menopause.org/professional-resources/menopause-journal-nm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Menopause</a>, the official journal of The Menopause Society.</p>



<p>Perimenopause marks the time leading up to the final menstrual period and includes the year after it ends. This transition can begin as early as the 30s and last for several years. Although it affects health and daily life, researchers have studied it far less than <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>.</p>



<p>"This study shines a light on how little we still understand about perimenopause and how much it affects people's daily lives," says first author <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hedges-mary-s-m-d/bio-20055284" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mary Hedges, M.D.</a>, a community internal medicine physician at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>. "At Mayo Clinic, we're working to expand that understanding so we can improve awareness and guide care that truly meets the needs of each patient."</p>



<p>Among more than 12,000 participants over age 35, the most common reported symptoms were fatigue (83%), exhaustion (83%), irritability (80%), low mood (77%), sleep problems (76%), digestive issues (76%) and anxiety (75%).</p>



<p>When asked what they associate with perimenopause, participants most often named hot flashes (71%), sleep problems (68%) and weight gain (65%). However, for those who said they were in perimenopause, 95% reported exhaustion and 93% reported <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/causes/sym-20050894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a> — far higher than the rate of hot flashes. Exhaustion is a general decrease in performance, impaired memory, decreased concentration, and forgetfulness, whereas fatigue is physical exhaustion.</p>



<p>These findings show that fatigue, mood changes and sleep-related issues are central to many people's perimenopause experiences, the study authors say. Hormone changes may affect the body's natural rhythms and restorative sleep, while mood changes can be influenced by hormones, inflammation and diet.</p>



<p>The research highlights that perimenopause symptoms can significantly affect daily life, relationships and work. Responsibilities such as caregiving and coexisting health conditions may add to the strain, increasing fatigue and emotional stress.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers say the study underscores the importance of rethinking how clinicians approach midlife health. They emphasize that understanding what people are truly experiencing — not just what is traditionally expected — is essential to improving care and communication during this life stage.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic continues to study how biological, lifestyle and social factors influence perimenopause symptoms and how greater awareness can help improve patient care. This work supports Mayo Clinic's vision to transform the practice of medicine through research that addresses real-world needs and leads to more informed, compassionate care.</p>
