<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Menopause</a> can accelerate age-related weight gain and increase the likelihood of developing overweight and obesity, which are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and other conditions. The decline in estrogen levels characteristic of menopause is also linked to changes independent of weight that can potentially raise <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-menopause-and-the-heart-connection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiovascular risk</a>. "This study provides important insights for developing more effective and personalized strategies for managing cardiometabolic risk in postmenopausal women," says Regina Castaneda, M.D., postdoctoral research fellow at Mayo Clinic and first author of the study.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/in-depth/hormone-therapy/art-20046372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hormone therapy</a> is the most effective first-line treatment for menopausal symptoms, including hot flashes and night sweats, which affect up to 75% of postmenopausal women. While evidence on how this therapy may interact with weight-loss medications is limited, some research has shown that postmenopausal women using hormone therapy experience greater weight loss when treated with the GLP-1-based obesity medication <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/semaglutide-subcutaneous-route/description/drg-20406730" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">semaglutide</a>.</p>



<p>No previous studies have examined whether hormone therapy might influence outcomes with tirzepatide. Dr. Castaneda and a team of researchers set out to investigate this relationship by reviewing data from 120 participants with overweight or obesity who received tirzepatide for weight management for 12 or more months. Patients receiving tirzepatide along with hormone therapy were compared to participants with similar characteristics who were not using hormone therapy.</p>

</div>


<p>"In this observational study, women who used menopausal hormone therapy lost about 35% more weight than women taking tirzepatide alone. Because this was not a randomized trial, we cannot say hormone therapy caused additional weight loss," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hurtado-andrade-maria-daniela-m-d-ph-d/bio-20490372" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maria Daniela Hurtado Andrade, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, endocrinologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study.</p>



<p>"It is possible that women using hormone therapy were already engaged in healthier behaviors, or that menopause symptom relief improved sleep and quality of life, making it easier to stay engaged with dietary and physical activity changes."</p>



<p>Dr. Castaneda says, while more studies that control for these factors are needed, the findings are clinically meaningful. "The magnitude of this difference warrants future studies that could help clarify how GLP-1-based obesity medications and menopausal hormone therapy may interact. Interestingly, preclinical data suggest a potential synergy, with estrogen appearing to enhance the appetite-suppressing effects of GLP-1," says Dr. Castaneda.</p>



<p>"Next, we plan to test these observations in a randomized clinical trial and determine if benefits extend beyond weight loss — specifically, whether hormone therapy also enhances the effects of these medications on cardiometabolic measures," adds Dr. Hurtado Andrade. "If confirmed, this work could speed the development and adoption of new, evidence-based strategies to reduce this risk for millions of postmenopausal women navigating this life stage."</p>

<p>On this week's launch of the fourth season of "<a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/tomorrows-cure-podcast?mc_id=global&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=tcseasontwoepisodeeight&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=global&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=190207">Tomorrow's Cure</a>," the first episode features two pioneers at the intersection of biology and technology. Together, they explore a fast-moving frontier in regenerative medicine: 3D bioprinting living, humanized skin model<strong>s</strong>&amp;nbsp;built from real human cells and biologic building blocks.</p>



<p>The podcast episode features&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wyles-saranya-p-m-d-ph-d/bio-20518649">Saranya Wyles, M.D., Ph.D</a>&amp;nbsp;a dermatologist at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;in Rochester, and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/bme/People/Faculty/profile/afeinberg.html">Adam Feinberg, Ph.D.</a>, principal investigator of the Regenerative Biomaterials and Therapeutics Group at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>



<p>Dr. Wyles describes skin as a set of "cake layers," including the epidermis, dermis and hypodermis. She proposes that people think about skin span. "It's an idea derived from health span and life span. Our concept is that we can have optimally functioning skin at the level of structure but also at the level of its function, serving as a barrier preventing infection for longer," Dr. Wyles says. "The skin is a mirror to your systemic health."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="fluidEmbed"><iframe loading="lazy" id="videoidPsni7MsovIA"  title="3D Bioprinted Skin: Breakthroughs in Regenerative Medicine | Tomorrow&amp;#039;s Cure Season 4 Episode 1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Psni7MsovIA?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p>A major goal is to model how skin changes over time because collagen and structure in younger skin can look very different from older skin. That's key for understanding healing, chronic wounds and how therapies may behave across ages and skin tones.</p>



<p>"We're using these advanced technologies to try to augment the body's ability to rebuild tissue structure," Dr. Feinberg says. He explains that collagen is the body's primary structural protein, so his lab focuses on bioprinting collagen in ways that mimic native tissue at microscopic scales. Using biologic materials rather than synthetic ones helps printed tissues behave more like the real thing and may improve how future implants integrate with the body.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Wyles highlights the team's work toward diagnostic and preclinical testing uses, with an emphasis on building an alternative to animal models. Printed skin can be observed as a living system, measured through its structure and secreted signals, then challenged with topical therapies to see how it responds.</p>



<p>Feinberg adds that moving away from animal testing is a growing priority, and engineered human tissue models may improve prediction because animal physiology differs from humans. The shared challenge is validation: proving that the models are reproducible and reliably predictive.</p>



<p>The episode also digs into senescent "<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/a-new-tool-to-find-hidden-zombie-cells/">zombie cells</a>," which stop dividing but do not die. Dr. Wyles explains they can accumulate with age and in chronic wounds, releasing signals that influence the surrounding tissue. Her team studies patient samples to map these cells in conditions such as diabetic foot ulcers, then uses those learnings to build more realistic printed models, including patient-specific versions.</p>



<p>Both guests discuss how bioprinted skin for routine clinical use will take time. Progress depends on carefully defining the most urgent clinical problems, proving performance and scaling manufacturing. Potential future applications discussed include improved wound patches for burns, chronic wounds and tissue-loss injuries, along with better ways to test treatments before they ever reach patients.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — In a new <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-025-05308-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot feasibility study</a>, researchers from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>, the University of Washington School of Medicine, the University of California San Francisco, and Nextrast Inc. found that a new imaging oral agent, also known as a "contrast agent," helps radiologists better see bowel structures and disease in CT imaging when compared with the current oral contrast agents.</p>

<p>The introduction of a new oral contrast agent for CT imaging addresses common challenges in the diagnosis of bowel diseases, says by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/fletcher-joel-g-m-d/bio-20053419" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joel Fletcher, M.D.</a>, lead author on the study and medical director of the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/ct-clinical-innovation-center/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic CT Clinical Innovation Center</a>. "The new oral contrast agent," he explains, "is ingested by patients prior to CT imaging and helps detect pathologies within and outside of the bowel wall in ways current imaging agents do not."</p>



<p>"We carefully designed this new class of oral contrast agent to overcome many of the diagnostic shortcomings of existing contrast agents for a broad range of diseases," says <a href="https://radiology.ucsf.edu/people/benjamin-yeh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Benjamin Yeh, M.D.</a>, a co-author on the study, radiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and co-founder of Nextrast, which created the new agent. "The Clinical Phase 2 results confirm that our dark agent can reveal previously impossible-to-detect findings, including very small bowel tumors and subtle inflammatory conditions that are often missed with conventional agents at CT."</p>



<p>In their <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00261-025-05308-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>, the authors report findings that suggest this new agent significantly improves visualization of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or cancer within the abdomen, and may provide earlier and more confident diagnoses.</p>



<p>The study compared CT scans of 32 patients with the dark borosilicate oral contrast agent and scans with conventional water or iodine-based oral contrast agents, to look at anatomical structures and disease presence.</p>



<p>"The novel dark borosilicate contrast agent has the potential to improve the assessment of numerous pathologies, including the detection of cancer and inflammatory disorders," says <a href="https://rad.uw.edu/people/amileto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Achille Mileto, M.D.</a>, a radiologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and first author of the study.</p>

<p>Evaluators identified clinically relevant findings in seven patients that were not detected using the standard contrast.</p>



<p>"CT scans performed with the new agent will likely do a better job of displaying pathologies in the stomach and proximal small bowel, areas where CT with traditional oral contrast performs poorly," Dr. Fletcher says. "Pathologies within the lumen will be better displayed because the lumen is more distended, and the brightness of the pathologies on the CT images will be increased, making them more conspicuous.”</p>



<p>The researchers say further study using a larger patient population is needed, but the initial findings show promise.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to abdominal imaging can help predict adults at higher risk of falling as early as middle age, a new <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study shows. The research, published in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2949761225001063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health</a>, highlights the importance of abdominal muscle quality, a component of core strength, as a key predictor of fall risk in adults aged 45 years and older.</p>



<p>Falls are a leading cause of injury, especially among older adults. Mayo Clinic researchers found that early markers of fall risk may be detectable in <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scans</a> that many patients have for other reasons.</p>



<p>Working with radiology bioinformatics experts, they set out to determine whether AI-derived measurements of fat distribution, muscle size and density and bone quality could reveal early signs of noteworthy physical changes.</p>



<p>They found that muscle density, a measure of muscle quality, was a much stronger predictor of fall risk than muscle size.</p>



<p>"Muscle size is just a measure of how big your muscles are," says lead author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/st-sauver-jennifer-ph-d/bio-00027743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer St. Sauver, Ph.D.</a>, an epidemiologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>. "Muscle density is different; on a CT scan, it's a measure of how 'dark' and homogenous the muscles are."</p>



<p>More homogenous muscles are denser and tend to have less fat in them, Dr. St. Sauver notes.</p>



<p>"Previous studies have suggested that muscle density, not size, is more strongly associated with physical strength and function," she says. "Our results support the idea that we should be focusing on muscle density, not muscle size, when we try to understand physical function."</p>



<p>The research team expected to see links between poorer performance on abdominal muscle measures and a higher incidence of falls in older adults, but what surprised them most was the strength of these associations in middle-aged adults and how strongly those measures predicted fall risk.</p>



<p>"Leg muscles have been associated with physical function, but our findings show that abdominal muscles also play a significant role," Dr. St. Sauver says.</p>



<p>The findings underscore the importance of maintaining good core strength throughout adulthood, she adds.</p>



<p>"One of the most important messages from this research is to keep your abdominal muscles in the best shape possible," Dr. St Sauver says. "Doing so may provide benefits that start in midlife and continue well into older adulthood."</p>

<p>Evenings in the Staal household often carried a delicate unpredictability. After a full school day — and as Ethan's medication began to wear off — the shift from playful to overwhelmed could happen in seconds. Ethan has <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/adhd/symptoms-causes/syc-20350889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</a>, a condition that can make emotional regulation especially challenging.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Ethan's feelings sometimes escalated faster than he could manage. In those difficult moments, his parents say, he became "not accessible"&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;often needing close to an hour before they could help guide him back to calm.&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Their search for specialized care led them to&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo&amp;nbsp;Clinic</a>, where child and adolescent psychiatrist&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/romanowicz-magdalena-m-d/bio-20306747" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magdalena Romanowicz, M.D.</a>, introduced the family to Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. She also invited them to&amp;nbsp;participate&amp;nbsp;in a first-of-its-kind study powered by a smartwatch and artificial intelligence (AI).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The smartwatch technology was designed to help anticipate when a child was nearing emotional overload, giving parents a chance to step in and defuse the situation before it escalated. For the Staals, the technology offered a clear sense of what was happening inside Ethan just early enough to help him through it.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It was a game-changer," Jared Staal says. "We still have challenges, but now we see them coming and we see them through a whole different lens — we didn't always know how to support him in those moments, and now we do."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A window into the moments before escalation</strong></h2>



<p>During the four-month <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2842819" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Ethan wore a smartwatch that tracked his heart rate, movement and sleep. When the system detected patterns that suggested his stress was building, it sent an alert to Sarah or Jared's phone.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It gave us a warning that something was coming," Sarah says. Instead of reacting at the peak of Ethan's distress, they could intervene earlier with calm reassurance, redirection and other techniques they learned in their 12 Parent-Child Interaction Therapy&nbsp;sessions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We could help him recover in 5 to 10 minutes," she says. "And we could have our evenings again as a family."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What the study revealed</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The Staals' experience reflects the study's overall findings.&amp;nbsp;In the clinical trial, smartwatch alerts prompted parents to respond within four seconds on average to early signs of escalating stress. Their children's severe tantrums were shortened by about 11 minutes — roughly half the duration seen with standard therapy alone.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The broader context underscores the need for new approaches. Nearly 1 in 5 U.S. children lives with a mental, behavioral or emotional health disorder, yet the number of pediatric mental health specialists has not kept pace with demand. Smartwatch technology represents one possible way to extend support into the home by helping families recognize early changes in a child's stress levels.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>The technology behind the alerts emerged from an unexpected spark.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Electrical and computer engineer <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/athreya-arjun-p-ph-d-m-s/bio-20473903" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arjun Athreya, Ph.D.</a>, worked just steps from the Children's Hospital Psychiatry Unit at Mayo Clinic — a single shared wall separating his world of algorithms and data from the clinical rooms where children and their families experienced some of their hardest moments.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Passing conversations with the psychiatrists next door became more formal collaborations as the team began to ask: What happens inside a child's body in the minutes before an outburst? And could those invisible shifts be measured?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>With support from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shekunov-julia-m-d/bio-20359665" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julia&amp;nbsp;Shekunov, M.D.</a>, Medical Director of the inpatient unit, and help from the nursing staff, the team launched a small pilot to explore those questions.&amp;nbsp;<br>&amp;nbsp;<br>From that work, Dr. Athreya and his team developed an AI model designed to recognize the earliest physiological changes that precede escalating behavior. That work became the&amp;nbsp;foundation&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;the smartwatch system now being explored with families.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A family's early role in the research</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>

<p>One of the first families to try out the smartwatch system was Sawra&amp;nbsp;and Matthew&amp;nbsp;Maurer and&amp;nbsp;their&amp;nbsp;son, Theo.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;Maurers, the challenges with Theo were mounting. Calls from kindergarten&amp;nbsp;had&amp;nbsp;become a near-weekly routine: "Theo is having a hard time. Could you&amp;nbsp;come get&amp;nbsp;him?"&amp;nbsp;Around that same time, Theo was diagnosed with ADHD, which helped explain the emotional dysregulation and sudden behavioral shifts they were seeing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Theo could slide from being engaged in an activity to overwhelmed in an instant — sweeping crayons off tables or having severe tantrums that&amp;nbsp;sometimes required&amp;nbsp;teachers to guide classmates out of the room. "It was a very difficult year," Sawra recalls.&amp;nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Enrolling in the early smartwatch <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37966360/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feasibility study</a> gave her new insight.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>During the study, Theo wore a watch each day that collected his physiological data — heart rate, movement, sleep patterns — while the family logged episodes in an AI-powered app.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>That data helped researchers understand what Theo's body was doing in the moments before he became dysregulated. By matching those physiological signals with what was happening behaviorally, the team could begin identifying the subtle shifts that happen as a child moves from calm toward distress and then back to calm.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Theo's data helped teach the system what those early changes look like in real-world settings.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Sawra didn't receive alerts in that early phase, but she could see the information the watch recorded. "The idea is wonderful," she says. "Being able to detect when a child is heading toward a severe tantrum would be a phenomenal thing for a parent."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Moving the research forward</strong></h2>



<p>Future studies will focus on improving the model, testing the system in larger groups and examining how real-time physiological data can inform care outside the clinic. As that work continues, the experiences of families like the Staals and the Maurers will help guide how the technology evolves and how it can support children in everyday life.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>PHOENIX&amp;nbsp;—&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;researchers have developed and evaluated MedEduChat, an electronic health record (EHR)&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;works with&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;large language model to provide accurate, patient-specific <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353087" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate cancer</a> education.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings are published in&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-025-02166-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Portfolio Digital Medicine</a>&amp;nbsp;and highlight&amp;nbsp;a new approach&amp;nbsp;to delivering&amp;nbsp;timely, individualized guidance for people navigating a prostate cancer diagnosis.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Cancer patients often face uncertainty as they process complex information about their diagnosis and treatment options. Limited time with clinicians can make it difficult for patients to receive the detailed answers they need to understand decisions that shape their care.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This&amp;nbsp;MedEduChat&amp;nbsp;study&amp;nbsp;demonstrates&amp;nbsp;how advanced AI, grounded in Mayo-validated clinical data, can help bridge these gaps by delivering clear, conversational explanations based on each patient's own health record.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the patient experience using&amp;nbsp;AI</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Fifteen prostate cancer patients interacted with&amp;nbsp;MedEduChat&amp;nbsp;for 20 to 30 minutes as part of a mixed-method usability study conducted at Mayo Clinic campuses in Arizona and Minnesota.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients reported higher confidence after using the tool, with Health Confidence Scores increasing from 9.9 to 13.9 on a 16-point scale. Usability scores were also high;&amp;nbsp;average survey responses ranked MedEduChat&amp;nbsp;83.7 out of 100.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients noted that&amp;nbsp;MedEduChat&amp;nbsp;helped them understand their diagnosis in a more accessible way. The&amp;nbsp;tool&amp;nbsp;provided relief by explaining unfamiliar or complex terms&amp;nbsp;in a clear and concise manner.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversational format&amp;nbsp;helped&amp;nbsp;participants replace incorrect assumptions with medically accurate information derived from their own EHR.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Clinician-evaluated accuracy and safety</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/liu-wei-ph-d/bio-20055721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wei Liu, Ph.D.</a>,&amp;nbsp;a radiation oncology medical physicist,&amp;nbsp;and three Mayo Clinic clinicians independently reviewed 85 anonymized question-and-response pairs. They rated MedEduChat's answers as highly correct (2.9 out of 3), complete (2.7 out of 3) and safe (2.7 out of 3).&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Clinicians also noted strong patient-readiness and moderate personalization, reflecting&amp;nbsp;MedEduChat's ability to tailor explanations to each person's age, treatment history and cancer stage.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Although&amp;nbsp;MedEduChat&amp;nbsp;delivered&amp;nbsp;accurate&amp;nbsp;and clinically aligned information, clinicians emphasized the importance of ongoing monitoring to prevent errors that could arise from incomplete or inconsistently documented EHR data.</p>



<p>The research team incorporated a&amp;nbsp;multilayer&amp;nbsp;approach&amp;nbsp;to address these concerns and guide future system enhancements.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Combining patient-centered education with AI</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>MedEduChat&amp;nbsp;was designed with a structured educational model that combines closed-domain clinical data, semi-structured guidance and personalized interaction.</p>



<p>Patients can explore diagnosis details, learn about treatment options and side effects, and review lifestyle considerations and follow-up expectations. The tool draws only from validated sources,&amp;nbsp;such as Mayo Clinic materials and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>&amp;nbsp;guidelines.</p>



<p>"This research demonstrates how large language models can be safely and effectively integrated into real clinical systems to improve cancer education,"&amp;nbsp;according&amp;nbsp;to Dr. Liu.&amp;nbsp;"By combining advanced AI with Mayo Clinic's electronic health records, MedEduChat delivers personalized, accurate and easy-to-understand explanations tailored to each patient's medical history."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Expanding AI&amp;nbsp;cancer research</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The study team plans to translate this work into clinical use across all three Mayo Clinic campuses&amp;nbsp;in Arizona,&amp;nbsp;Florida&amp;nbsp;and Minnesota. Next steps include expanding MedEduChat beyond radiation oncology to additional cancer specialties. These efforts aim to make personalized AI-assisted education a routine part of cancer care.</p>



<p>This research was funded by the National Cancer Institute, the Eric and Wendy Schmidt Fund for AI Research and Innovation, the Fred C. and Katherine B. Andersen Foundation, and The Kemper and Ethel Marley Fund in Cancer Research.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researcher&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/couch-fergus-j-ph-d/bio-00027515" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fergus Couch, Ph.D.</a>,&nbsp;has spent his career studying inherited&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>&nbsp;and cancer genetics. Early on, he saw that many families lived with uncertainty of their cancer risk, especially when genetic tests revealed variants no one fully understood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He set out to change that.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Couch&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;consultant&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;laboratory medicine and pathology&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&amp;nbsp;and holds the Zbigniew and Anna M. Scheller Professorship in Medical Research in Honor of Dr. Thomas J. McDonald.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic works with an international network of collaborators, which includes Dr. Couch and his team,&amp;nbsp;who have&amp;nbsp;helped&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;many inherited gene alterations that contribute to breast cancer risk.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"We interact on a thematic level — surgeons, oncologists, pathologists, geneticists and biochemists," Dr. Couch shares. "We all work together, focused on improving our knowledge of breast cancer and quickly developing treatments and cures for patients at Mayo Clinic."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Earlier this year,&nbsp;Dr. Couch and other co-authors&nbsp;published&nbsp;a study in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08388-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature</a>,&nbsp;which&nbsp;included&nbsp;one of the most comprehensive functional maps to date of the BRCA2 cancer risk gene.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>By testing&amp;nbsp;nearly every&amp;nbsp;possible change&amp;nbsp;in this gene, Mayo Clinic researchers can&amp;nbsp;identify&amp;nbsp;which patients are more likely to&amp;nbsp;benefit&amp;nbsp;from targeted cancer therapies.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The work reclassifies previously uncertain genetic test results, helping care teams individualize cancer screening,&amp;nbsp;prevention&amp;nbsp;and treatment. Together, it shows how Mayo Clinic is turning complex genetic data into information clinicians can use now, a central goal of&amp;nbsp;precision medicine.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's the extra step that makes the difference, helping people use the findings immediately," Dr. Couch says. "The results of our paper&amp;nbsp;are used to help patients in the clinic. My entire career has been focused on getting information to patients as quickly as possible."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Dr. Couch continues to explore why certain inherited changes lead to cancer, why some families develop breast cancer without known risk&amp;nbsp;genes&amp;nbsp;and how discoveries in the lab can&amp;nbsp;translate&amp;nbsp;to improved&amp;nbsp;care.&amp;nbsp;Just this month,&amp;nbsp;Dr. Couch won the prestigious Komen&amp;nbsp;Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction in Basic Science&amp;nbsp;for his significant work in advancing breast cancer research.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — As rates of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high blood pressure</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2 diabetes</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep apnea</a> increase, cases of advanced chronic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver disease</a> and resulting liver scarring or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cirrhosis</a> also are rising. Patients often are diagnosed based on symptoms, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gastrointestinal-bleeding/symptoms-causes/syc-20372729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gastrointestinal bleeding</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/edema/symptoms-causes/syc-20366493" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fluid retention</a> or jaundice, which happen when liver disease has progressed to a late stage. This problem led <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) model that resulted in twice the number of advanced chronic liver disease diagnoses in patients without symptoms, helping physicians treat them before the disease had progressed.</p>

<p>"Chronic liver disease is a progressive condition, so the sooner we can diagnose it, the sooner we can stop it from advancing to irreversible stages. Early intervention may decrease the likelihood that a patient will need a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a> in the future," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/simonetto-doug-a-m-d/bio-20205767" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doug Simonetto, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic transplant hepatologist and lead author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-04058-y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Nature Medicine.</p>



<p>The heart and liver are closely linked. Liver scarring may lead to increased local pressure that can affect the heart. As a result, a heartbeat test called an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a> can capture electrical signal changes in the heart connected to advanced liver disease. Dr. Simonetto and colleagues <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40146029/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developed an AI model</a> to analyze data from 11,513 Mayo Clinic patients undergoing routine ECGs. The model looked for patterns connected to advanced liver disease in the ECG data, and it found twice the number of patients who were diagnosed by standard methods. The diagnosis was confirmed by validated imaging or <a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/test-catalog/overview/38292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood tests</a>.</p>

<p>"As a family physician, I've often seen how advanced liver disease — which frequently has no symptoms until it becomes irreversible — can go undetected," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/david-rushlow-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Rushlow, M.D.</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System</a> family physician and study co-author. "Many patients identified through the AI-ECG model had no idea they were living with advanced liver disease. By identifying these cases earlier, we were able to connect them to the right treatment — at a time when intervention can truly make a difference. For these patients, the technology helped us not only to uncover a diagnosis, it created an opportunity for better health outcomes and, in some cases, may have saved lives."</p>



<p>In this randomized clinical trial, 248 clinicians at Mayo Clinic in Rochester and throughout the Mayo Clinic Health System participated.</p>



<p>"The idea that a simple, noninvasive and inexpensive test could help identify patients at risk of developing advanced liver disease was very compelling. This study provided an opportunity to evaluate AI in our real-world clinical environment, where the true test of innovation is whether it improves care for patients in the community," says Dr. Rushlow. "We're only beginning to understand the full potential of AI-enabled tools like this and the promise they hold for preventive, personalized care."</p>



<p>In the next steps, the researchers will follow up with the patients, who were newly diagnosed with advanced liver disease, over the next two years.</p>



<p>The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.</p>

<p>These discoveries reflect progress across three major innovation&nbsp;efforts&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic.&nbsp;Mayo Clinic clinicians and scientists are working together&nbsp;to&nbsp;develop tools to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions through the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/search/?search=%22Precure%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Precure initiative</a>.&nbsp;They&nbsp;are advancing new cures for end-organ failure beyond traditional transplantation&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/search/?search=%22Genesis%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genesis initiative</a>. They are also uniting clinical insight with&nbsp;cutting-edge engineering to deliver novel&nbsp;neurological&nbsp;diagnostics and therapies through the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/search/?search=%22Bioelectronics+Neuromodulation+Innovation+to+Cure%22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bioelectronics&nbsp;Neuromodulation Innovation to Cure (BIONIC) initiative</a>.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have created "virtual clinical trials"&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;advance&amp;nbsp;the discovery of therapies while reducing time,&amp;nbsp;cost&amp;nbsp;and the risk of failed studies by combining advanced computer modeling with real-world patient data&amp;nbsp;as part of the Precure and Genesis initiatives. Through one virtual clinical trial, they have developed a new way to predict whether existing drugs could be repurposed to treat heart failure, one of the world's most pressing health challenges.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Clinical trials will always remain essential," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tao-cui-ph-d/bio-20563927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cui&amp;nbsp;Tao,&amp;nbsp;Ph.D.</a>, the Nancy Peretsman and Robert Scully Chair&amp;nbsp;of Artificial Intelligence and Informatics and vice president of Mayo Clinic Platform Informatics. "But this innovation demonstrates how AI can make research more efficient, affordable and broadly accessible. Integrating trial emulation, simulation,&amp;nbsp;synthetic&amp;nbsp;trials&amp;nbsp;and biomedical knowledge modeling opens the door to a new paradigm in translational science."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have uncovered the molecular "switch" that directs a small but powerful set of cells that choose&amp;nbsp;whether to repair tissue or fight infection, a discovery that could inform regenerative therapies for chronic lung diseases, which is part of Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative.<br>&amp;nbsp;<br>"We were surprised to find that these specialized cells cannot do both jobs at once," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brownfield-douglas-g-ph-d/bio-20522531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.</a>, senior author of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64224-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>. "Some commit to rebuilding, while others focus on defense. That division of labor is essential — and by uncovering the switch that controls it, we can start thinking about how to restore balance when it breaks down in disease."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers&amp;nbsp;found&amp;nbsp;that&amp;nbsp;injecting&amp;nbsp;patients' own stem cells from fat cells into the vein before hemodialysis, a treatment for end-stage kidney disease, often&amp;nbsp;helped prevent inflammation and vein narrowing. This could help millions of people tolerate dialysis longer, extending the time before they&amp;nbsp;require&amp;nbsp;a kidney transplant as part of the&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;Genesis initiative.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Using detailed maps of&amp;nbsp;each&amp;nbsp;patient's unique brain wave patterns, Mayo Clinic physicians can&amp;nbsp;now pinpoint&amp;nbsp;where stimulation&amp;nbsp;is most effective, moving beyond the traditional one-size-fits-all&amp;nbsp;approach to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epilepsy</a> treatment.

<p>After&nbsp;identifying&nbsp;a sugar molecule that cancer cells&nbsp;use on their surfaces to hide from the immune system, Mayo Clinic researchers have found the same molecule may eventually help in the treatment of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 1 diabetes</a>, once known as juvenile diabetes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers and collaborators have described — for the first time — the prevalence of autoimmune diseases in the U.S. Their research reports that about&amp;nbsp;15 million people&amp;nbsp;are estimated to have one or more of 105 autoimmune diseases. The study also found that autoimmune diseases occur most often in women, and it identified the top autoimmune diseases by prevalence, sex and age.&amp;nbsp;<br>&amp;nbsp;<br>"Knowing the number of patients with an autoimmune disease in the U.S. is critical to assess whether these diseases are increasing or decreasing over time and with treatment," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/fairweather-delisa-ph-d/bio-20320752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeLisa Fairweather, Ph.D.</a>,&amp;nbsp;vice-chair of translational research for the&amp;nbsp;Department of Cardiovascular Medicine&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Florida and corresponding author of the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/178722" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.<br><br>###&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — A new multicenter study led by Mayo Clinic researchers has established a practical, evidence-based definition for <a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/neurology/dementia/rapidly-progressive-dementia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rapidly progressive dementia (RPD)</a>, a rare but devastating form of cognitive decline that develops over months instead of years. The findings, <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000214439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Neurology</a>, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology, may help clinicians recognize and treat RPD earlier, and enable researchers to work from a shared framework when studying the condition.</p>



<p>While most types of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a> progress gradually, RPD advances with alarming speed, often leading to significant cognitive decline or death within one to two years. Although it accounts for around 4% of dementia cases, RPD is difficult to diagnose. Symptoms can stem from numerous causes, including autoimmune disease, infections, neurodegenerative disorders such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a> and rare conditions like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/creutzfeldt-jakob-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20371226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease</a>. This makes it challenging to consistently define the disorder across different settings.</p>

<p>"Clinicians need a clear, standardized way to identify patients whose decline is unusually fast," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a behavioral neurologist at Mayo Clinic and senior author of the study. "This helps ensure that those with potentially treatable causes are recognized quickly, wherever they are seen. Furthermore, this is a necessary step before launching multicenter studies aimed at understanding why a small subset of dementia patients progresses rapidly and how to address this through clinical trials and treatments."</p>



<p>The new definition proposed by Dr. Day and his colleagues uses the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/clinical-dementia-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR)</a> scale, a well-established tool for assessing dementia severity. Criteria are based on the level of functional impairment involving memory, orientation, judgment, problem-solving, community affairs, home and hobbies, and personal care. Under the new framework, a person is considered to have rapidly progressive dementia if they develop mild dementia (CDR score of 1 or higher) within one year of symptom onset, or moderate-to-severe dementia (CDR score of 2 or higher) within two years. Researchers refer to this as the "1-in-1 or 2-in-2" rule.</p>



<p>To test this definition, the research team applied it to two large datasets. The first, known as the RaPID cohort, included 248 patients evaluated for suspected RPD at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a> and Washington University in St. Louis. The second used data from the <a href="https://naccdata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center</a>, representing more than 19,000 participants across 46 research centers in the United States.</p>



<p>In the RaPID group, about 75% of patients met the new criteria. Nearly 1 in 3 had autoimmune or inflammatory causes — many of which are potentially reversible. In the broader national dataset, about 4% met the definition for RPD, with Alzheimer's disease being the most common underlying cause. Across both groups, people who met the RPD definition declined 3 to 4 times faster than those with typical dementia, based on changes measured using the CDR scale.</p>



<p>The new definition proved reliable across clinical and research settings, identifying both rare and common causes of RPD. It can be applied using a patient's clinical history instead of specialized testing, making it adaptable in diverse healthcare settings, including those with limited medical resources.</p>



<p>"By uniformly defining rapid progression, we can better identify patients who might benefit from treatment, improve consistency in research, and ultimately enhance care for people facing one of the most challenging forms of dementia," Dr. Day says.</p>
