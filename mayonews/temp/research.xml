<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>, marked by memory loss, trouble concentrating and thinking, and changes in personality and behavior, devastates patients, their families and loved ones. With new treatments available for people with early signs of Alzheimer's disease, there is a growing need for accessible and cost-effective tests to diagnose Alzheimer's disease sooner. In a new study, Mayo Clinic researchers confirmed the accuracy of an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-clears-first-blood-test-used-diagnosing-alzheimers-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FDA-approved blood test</a>&nbsp;that can be used at outpatient memory clinics to diagnose the disease in patients with a range of cognitive impairment. The findings are&nbsp;<a href="https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.70316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Alzheimer's and Dementia: The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association</a>.</p>



<p>Standard ways of measuring the buildup of toxic proteins in the brain that indicate Alzheimer's disease include positron emission tomography, or PET scans, and spinal taps. But these tests can be expensive and invasive. More accessible, non-invasive and cost-effective biomarkers&nbsp;—&nbsp;measurable indicators of a disease&nbsp;—&nbsp;are needed to improve diagnoses broadly in clinical settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our study found that blood testing affirmed the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease with 95% sensitivity and 82% specificity,” says corresponding author&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/day-gregg-s-m-d/bio-20545897" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregg Day, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic neurologist, dementia specialist and clinical researcher. "When performed in the outpatient clinical setting, this is similar to the accuracy of cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers of the disease and is much more convenient and cost-effective."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>The research team says their findings show promise in:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Better identifying research participants with Alzheimer's disease brain changes.</li>



<li>Screening and selecting patients with Alzheimer's disease for clinical trials.</li>



<li>Assessing how patients respond to therapy in clinical trials.<br></li>
</ul>



<p>More than 500 patients receiving treatment for a range of memory issues at the outpatient&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/memory-disorder-clinic-florida/overview/ovc-20556902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Memory Disorder Clinic</a>&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>&nbsp;participated in the study. They included patients with early- and late-onset cognitive impairment, typical and atypical Alzheimer's disease,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lewy-body-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lewy body dementia</a>&nbsp;and vascular cognitive impairment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients ranged from 32 to 89 years old, with the average age of symptom onset being 66. Alzheimer's disease was determined to be the underlying cause of the symptoms in 56% of the patients. The team also conducted serum tests to measure kidney disease, which can influence plasma biomarker concentrations.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a>&nbsp;tested for two proteins in blood plasma that are associated with amyloid plaque buildup, the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease:&nbsp;Aβ42/40 and p-tau217. The researchers found that p-tau217 levels were higher in patients with Alzheimer's disease versus those without the disease. Higher plasma p-tau217 concentrations were also associated with impaired kidney function, which researchers say should be taken into account when performing the blood test.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Plasma p-tau217 concentrations were positive in 267 out of 509 patients, including 233 of 246 patients (95%) with cognitive impairment attributed to Alzheimer's disease.</p>



<p>The study was featured at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.aan.com/events/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Academy of Neurology Annual Meeting</a>&nbsp;in April.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39030981/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous study</a>, researchers from the Mayo Clinic Laboratories team showed the utility of these blood tests compared to amyloid PET scans in research participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Day says the next steps in this research are to evaluate blood-based testing in more diverse patient populations and people with early Alzheimer's disease who show no cognitive symptoms. The team also wants to evaluate disease-specific factors that may alter biomarker accuracy in clinical trials.</p>

<p><em>Late-breaking abstract featured at ASCO 2025</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colon cancer</a> is the third most prevalent form of cancer in the U.S., and while screening has helped detect and prevent colon cancer from spreading, major advancements in treating colon cancer have lagged.</p>



<p>Now, new research led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> found that adding immunotherapy to chemotherapy after surgery for patients with stage 3 (node-positive) colon cancer — and with a specific genetic makeup called deficient DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) — was associated with a 50% reduction in cancer recurrence and death compared to chemotherapy alone. Approximately 15% of people diagnosed with colon cancer exhibit dMMR and, to date, these tumors appear less sensitive to chemotherapy. The results of the multi-center <a href="https://meetings.asco.org/abstracts-presentations/244715">study</a> were presented during a plenary session at the <a href="https://www.asco.org/annual-meeting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting</a> in Chicago.</p>



<p>"The findings from our study represent a major advance in the adjuvant treatment of dMMR stage 3 colon cancer and will now change the treatment for this type of cancer," says oncologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/sinicrope-frank-a-m-d/bio-00028129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Sinicrope, M.D.</a>, who led the study. "It's extremely rewarding to be able to offer our patients a new treatment regimen that can reduce the risk of recurrence and improve their chances of survival."</p>



<p>Until now, the standard treatment after surgery for any stage 3 colon cancer has been chemotherapy. However, the researchers note that approximately 30% of patients experience cancer recurrence despite this treatment.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

<p>The clinical trial enrolled 712 patients with dMMR stage 3 colon cancer that had been surgically removed and who had cancer cells in their lymph nodes<a>.</a> The immunotherapy given in this study was an immune checkpoint inhibitor, known as atezolizumab, which activates one's immune system to attack and kill cancer cells, which are responsible for cancer recurrence and spread. The patients — who lived in the U.S. and Germany — received chemotherapy for six months along with immunotherapy and then continued with immunotherapy alone for another six months.</p>



<p>Dr. Sinicrope and others previously studied patients with colon cancer whose cells are unable to repair errors during DNA replication that create a nucleotide mismatch, a condition called dMMR. They noted that these patients' tumors showed a striking increase in inflammatory cells within the tumor, including those that express the target of immune checkpoint inhibitors. This sparked the idea of using immune checkpoint inhibitors to make the immune cells more effective in attacking and killing the cancer cells.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the data from this study, Dr. Sinicrope recommends this combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy treatment to be the new standard treatment for stage 3 deficient mismatch repair colon cancer. The research team plans to approach the <a href="https://www.nccn.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Comprehensive Cancer Network</a>, a nonprofit organization consisting of 33 leading cancer centers, including Mayo Clinic, with this recommendation. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study included patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>, the most common form of hereditary colon cancer, as these patients can have tumors that show deficient mismatch repair (dMMR).</p>



<p>"We're changing the paradigm in colon cancer treatment. By using immunotherapy at earlier stages of disease, we are achieving meaningful benefits for our patients," says Dr. Sinicrope.</p>

<p-->A new test in development at Mayo Clinic could help doctors diagnose&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-is-valley-fever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">valley fever</a>&nbsp;faster, possibly at the first visit. Also known as coccidioidomycosis, valley fever is a lung infection caused by breathing in a fungus found in dry, dusty soil, especially in the Southwest.<p></p>



<p>Many people have no symptoms, but in some cases, the infection can spread to the brain, bones, or spine and become life-threatening. Because&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20378761" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms</a>&nbsp;often mimic the flu or pneumonia, valley fever is frequently misdiagnosed. Current&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/valley-fever/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20378765" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tests</a>&nbsp;can be slow and unclear, delaying the right treatment.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/grys-thomas-e-ph-d/bio-00027752" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Thomas Grys</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher working in collaboration with Arizona State University, is developing next-generation tools to detect valley fever earlier and more accurately. The goal is to help patients get answers and early treatment.</p>



<p>Here's how Mayo Clinic is advancing the future of valley fever diagnoses.</p>

<p>From the vast deserts of the Southwest to the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Grys at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, microscopic fungal spores of valley fever are the focus of research.</p>



<p>"Spores are kind of like the seeds of the fungus. They are very durable. They can exist and persist in the environment. And they're tiny, so they float in the air and we can breathe them in," says Dr. Grys.</p>

<p>Each year, up to 3% of people in the Southwest are exposed to infection and develop antibodies, no matter how long they’ve lived there. Dr. Grys says valley fever infections are common, but the current diagnostics could be better.</p>



<p>"And one of the most frustrating things is, if someone has symptoms of a brain infection with valley fever, it's difficult to confirm whether they have that in their brain or not, and if they do, they're going to be on antifungal medications for the rest of their life. We cannot cure it from the brain," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rapid test</strong></h2>



<p>That's why this rapid antibody test being developed — similar in format to a COVID-19 test —&nbsp;&nbsp;is so important.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Valley fever test strips" class="wp-image-403113" style="width:684px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/valley-fever-test-strips-lab-16-x-9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Valley fever test strips</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"The test we're working on can detect antibodies in 10 minutes. We still have to wait for the body to respond to the fungus, but once it does, we can provide answers in 10 minutes," Dr. Grys says.</p>



<p>The shortened time to detect fungal antibodies means that answers could be back in time to inform patient care during their visit.</p>



<p>"Some patients come in four or five times until they figure out what's happening. Every single time going to the doctor, you have to find transportation, you might have to find childcare. It's a burden to have to go in," he says.</p>



<p>And for patients, Dr. Grys says the rapid antibody test could change the paradigm.</p>



<p>"The median time to diagnosis is 23 days. Half of the people take more than 23 days to find out they have valley fever. If we can get testing that's more rapid and get answers faster, people will be more prone to test because a decision can be made while the patient is there," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Availability</strong></h3>



<p>The antibody test is licensed to a startup company, and the test is expected to be commercially available for laboratory use by the end of 2025.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment</strong></h3>



<p>For advanced cases of valley fever, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/cocci-clinic/overview/ovc-20457111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cocci Clinic</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Arizona offers a coordinated, multispecialty team — including infectious diseases specialists, pulmonologists, neurologists, dermatologists and cardiothoracic surgeons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This study explores the relationship between hospitals' implementation of telehealth services and the impact on patients' social needs," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/spaulding-aaron-c-ph-d/bio-20249847" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Spaulding, Ph.D.</a>, a healthcare researcher at the <a href="/Users/M294284/AppData/Local/Microsoft/Windows/INetCache/Content.Outlook/3BAWTU3E/Mayo%20Clinic%20Robert%20D.%20and%20Patricia%20E.%20Kern%20Center%20for%20the%20Science%20of%20Health%20Care%20Delivery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery</a> and senior author of the study.&nbsp; "The study aims to determine the effects on four key outcomes: better patient health, reduced hospital service use, lowered healthcare costs and enhanced community health."</p>



<p>The study also found that when patients used online therapy, they were much more likely to say their overall health in the community had improved compared to those who did not receive such services.</p>



<p>The study investigators say that the findings provide a closer look into telehealth's versatile ability to address social determinants of health and offer a path for future research into ways to enhance overall patient-centered care.</p>



<p>"There has been significant research identifying gaps in healthcare due to social determinants of health,"</p>



<p>says Dr. Spaulding. "The publication team has explored various avenues to understand the barriers to access and areas that inadvertently worsen outcomes related to social determinants."</p>



<p>Dr. Spaulding notes that telehealth, when combined with in-person visits, has the potential to help create a more integrated approach to healthcare delivery, but says that it should be treated as a complementary tool and that any approach needs to be personalized.</p>



<p>"Different patients require varying levels of care, and while our systems are improving, some patients may benefit from telehealth, while others may prefer in-person care," says Dr. Spaulding.&nbsp; "Additionally, a combination of approaches might be beneficial for certain individuals."</p>



<p>Looking ahead, the researchers emphasize the need to continue focusing on strategically and thoughtfully deploying telehealth services in patient care.</p>



<p>"We must continue to assess the most effective ways to use telehealth to benefit patients," says Dr. Spaulding. "This evaluation should consider both hospital-specific outcomes, such as readmissions and emergency department visits, as well as patient experience and patient-reported outcomes."</p>

<p>Dr. Ethel Aguirre Flores broke her first bone before she learned to walk. Since then, she has endured more than 125 other fractures — femurs, arms, ribs and vertebrae. Her medical chart includes 41 surgeries and six metal rods that hold her limbs together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her most recent fracture happened just months ago when she broke her toe while dancing. Not long before that, her femur snapped while she was simply walking.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But through it all, her determination, perseverance and commitment to helping others have remained unbreakable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/overview/specialty-groups/pediatric-metabolic-bone-disorders-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteogenesis imperfecta</a>, a rare genetic disorder also known as brittle bone disease, Dr. Aguirre Flores is now completing her residency in medical genetics and genomics at Mayo Clinic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>She came to Mayo specifically to study under one of the leading physician-scientists in the world focused on treating brittle bone disease at the molecular level. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/deyle-david-r-m-d/bio-00097430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. David Deyle</a>, a clinical geneticist, has spent nearly 30 years studying the condition's genetic underpinnings and building the expertise needed to do what medicine has never done: develop a therapy that repairs it at its source.&nbsp;In addition to leading research, Dr. Deyle devotes most of his time to patient care, seeing nearly 30 patients with rare genetic disorders each week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our goal is to correct the underlying genetic defect of osteogenesis imperfecta," Dr. Deyle says. "That means going directly into the genome, because you can't transplant bone stem cells. You have to repair them at their source."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deyle is developing gene therapy to target the genetic mutation that disrupts collagen, the protein that gives bones their strength. The mutation produces a faulty form of collagen, which leaves bones weak and prone to fractures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deyle's team is pursuing two primary approaches. One uses gene editing, such as CRISPR, a tool that precisely cuts and modifies DNA, to eliminate the faulty genetic instructions. The other uses a small molecule therapy to strengthen bone density without altering DNA. Both approaches are inching closer to clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We can do this in the lab," Dr. Deyle says. "The challenge is delivery — getting the therapy directly into the bone."&nbsp;</p>

<p>That same precision guides the team's work across a range of rare conditions<strong>. </strong>One project involves classical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</a>, a connective tissue disorder marked by fragile skin and poor wound healing. Dr. Deyle's team is using a combination of gene and cell therapies to give patients a second working copy of the gene they're missing. The modified cells are then reintroduced into the body to aid healing at the site of injury.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another effort targets <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurofibromatosis-type-1/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurofibromatosis</a>, a disease that causes tumors to grow along nerves. Dr. Deyle's team was the first to use a viral vector to deliver a key therapeutic protein. The method, which relies on a modified virus to transport treatment directly into cells, could help advance gene therapies for other rare conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the science is groundbreaking, the stories behind it are equally compelling.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Some of the most determined minds behind this research in Dr. Deyle's lab know these conditions firsthand, including Dr. Aguirre Flores. She's the third person with brittle bone disease to train under his guidance.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"People with this condition know what it means to face setbacks," Dr. Deyle says. "That gives them a focus you can't teach. You can see it in Dr. Aguirre Flores — she's a fighter, and she pours everything she has into this work because of what she's lived through."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Aguirre Flores grew up in northern Mexico, the only daughter in a family of four children. Her parents encouraged her to chase every dream. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"They would always let me know anything's possible," she says. "You can do anything you want."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She swam competitively, earning medals despite broken ribs. She painted with casts on her legs. &nbsp;</p>



<p>At age 8, she met a care team in Texas that changed her view of what care could be. That's when she knew she wanted to become a doctor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"They saw me as a child first, not just a diagnosis," Dr. Aguirre Flores says. "That changed everything." &nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, she brings that same perspective to her own career. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"I know what these children are going through. I want to help children with congenital disorders as a whole and help them live their childhood to the best," Dr. Aguirre Flores says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, she will graduate from Mayo Clinic's Medical Genetics and Genomics Residency and begin a new role as a pediatric geneticist in Texas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I hope that my story brings hope and inspires others to not put limits on themselves," Dr. Aguirre Flores says. "And to always go after your dreams."&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&nbsp;Millions of people are affected by chronic dry mouth, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dry-mouth/symptoms-causes/syc-20356048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">xerostomia</a>, an agonizing side effect of damaged salivary glands.

Currently, there is no cure for it.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have established the world's first biobank of human salivary gland tissue-organoids that opens the door to research to find a cure.</p>

<p>"This unique biobank resource overcomes a major barrier we've faced in the field, namely: limited access to standardized salivary specimens suited for salivary gland regeneration research. This collection provides a foundation for regenerative therapy development, especially for radiation-induced chronic dry mouth," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kannan-nagarajan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20233074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</a>, lead author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-025-00410-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in NPJ Regenerative Medicine. Dr. Kannan is also the director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/stem-cell-and-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>Nearly 70% of patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy experience permanent damage to their salivary glands. People with this condition experience diminished quality of life from a constant feeling like cotton is lining their mouths. Besides being uncomfortable, chronic dry mouth can lead to difficulties with chewing, tasting, speaking and swallowing. It also can cause tooth decay.</p>



<p>"Chronic dry mouth can extend long after radiation treatments are complete. It's among the top concerns I hear from patients with head and neck cancer. Unfortunately, there aren't many therapeutics available commercially for these patients," says&nbsp;co-author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/janus-jeffrey-jeff-r-m-d/bio-20206511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey Janus, M.D.</a>, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>One promising avenue of research is the cultivation of rare regenerative cells to greater numbers that can help people someday heal and grow new, healthy salivary gland cells. The biobank consists of specimens collected from 208 donors. From this repository, researchers have already found biomarkers for mature, saliva-producing cells, and with the help of a high-resolution protein map, they have identified the potential tissue origin of rare, self-renewing salivary cells.</p>



<p>The research team also developed a radiation injury model, which paired with the biobank, provides an integrated platform to discover new, personalized regenerative biotherapeutics.</p>

<p>September marks the start of soybean harvest in Mankato, Minnesota, a busy time of year when farmers can't afford to be away from their fields for long. So, when Craig Smith, 66, began experiencing a burning sensation while urinating, he went to his family physician right away.</p>



<p>He was prescribed antibiotics, but his symptoms worsened. When Smith began to pass blood, his wife insisted that they drive straight to Mayo Clinic in Rochester — about an hour and a half away. There, Mayo Clinic physicians diagnosed him with metastatic urothelial cancer, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer</a>, which had spread to his spine.</p>



<p>Smith recalls receiving a phone call late that night from his Mayo Clinic doctor, who asked him if he wanted to just maintain his health for a few years or cure his cancer.</p>



<p>"I said, 'I'd like you to cure it,'" says Smith.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking a bladder cancer cure</strong></h2>



<p>Smith's father had been a farmer, which was his dream too. But his father suggested he gain additional skills to supplement his farming income. Following his father's advice and encouragement from his high school welding teacher, Smith pursued his teaching certificate in welding. What he initially thought would be five or six years of teaching turned into a 45-year career developing welding programs at several local schools while also raising cattle and growing soybeans and corn on his 2,000-acre farm. Through his welding programs, he has trained several welders now employed by local manufacturing companies.</p>



<p>After his diagnosis in 2023, Smith took a hiatus from teaching and farming to focus on his cancer treatments at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>, which included chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>Metastatic urothelial cancer that has spread beyond the bladder usually is considered incurable and inoperable. However, Smith responded well to chemotherapy and radiation to his spine, which made his oncologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/orme-jacob-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20545524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Orme, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, and urologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shah-paras-h-m-d/bio-20571894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paras Shah, M.D.</a>, consider Smith for a new, surgical approach to treatment.</p>



<p>Smith proceeded with the proposed surgery and had his bladder, prostate and 36 lymph nodes removed.</p>



<p>"In Mr. Smith's bladder, we found viable cancer cells that would have led to a relapse. Now, however, he is nearly two years from diagnosis and remains disease-free," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>Smith's positive response to treatment and surgery has spurred a clinical trial testing this aggressive approach in other bladder cancer patients. Currently, 17 participants are enrolled, and the results so far have been promising.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)"><blockquote><p>"It takes brave patients like Mr. Smith and these other patients that we've seen who are excited for the possibility of a cure but also are excited about the possibility of helping other people with cancers like them in the future."</p><cite>Jacob orme, M.D., Ph.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>Advances in cancer treatment, such as immunotherapy that harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer and the identification of biomarkers in the blood or urine that show how well a patient is responding to treatment, are helping the physicians select who will benefit most from surgery.</p>



<p>"The impetus for this study is to attack the cancer from multiple approaches, including treatments that cover head-to-toe and treatments that are directed right at the source tumor," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boorjian-stephen-a-m-d/bio-00092877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen A. Boorjian, M.D.</a>, who is the David and Anne Luther Chair of Urology at Mayo Clinic and a lead proponent of the study.</p>



<p>"We want to remove the root of the cancer after we've burned off the leaves," adds Dr. Orme.</p>



<p>A team of researchers, physicians and clinical trials staff expedited the clinical trial through an accelerated pathway called a Rapid Activation Trial. It's part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic to launch new clinical trials swiftly and effectively.</p>



<p>"Shortening activation timelines allows us to make a difference to more patients and their families," says Michelle Monosmith, Mayo Clinic Office of Clinical Trials operations administrator.</p>



<p>The study is supported by a generous donation by Ronald J. and Carol T. Beerman to Mayo Clinic and has been prioritized by Dr. Boorjian and Chair of Oncology <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heath-elisabeth-i-m-d/bio-20576547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elisabeth Heath, M.D.</a>, to achieve more cures for men and women with bladder cancer.</p>



<p>"Our only goal is to help our patients live better and longer," says Dr. Orme.</p>



<p>That's what Smith plans to do as he continues to farm, teach and spend time with his family.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new discovery by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers could mean more donor hearts are available for heart transplant, giving more people a second chance at life.</p>



<p>In findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00653-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Nature Cardiovascular Research, a team led by Mayo Clinic cardiac surgeon <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tang-paul-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20554335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Tang, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, identified a biological process that contributes to donor heart injury during cold storage. The researchers found that a drug already used to treat heart conditions can prevent this damage.</p>



<p>Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage heart failure, yet fewer than half of donor hearts are ultimately used. One major reason is the relatively short window for transplanting a donated heart into a patient, due to concerns over low donor heart function that comes from leaving a heart in cold storage too long. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why donor hearts deteriorate in cold storage</strong></h2>



<p>Although cold storage slows metabolism and helps preserve tissue, prolonged exposure to cold storage conditions can lead to molecular changes that compromise how well the heart performs after transplant. One complication is called primary graft dysfunction, in which the transplanted heart cannot pump blood effectively after surgery. This may affect up to 20% of recipients to varying degrees.</p>



<p>To investigate why this damage occurs, the researchers focused on a protein inside heart cells called the mineralocorticoid receptor, which plays a role in how cells respond to stress. During cold storage, they found that this protein undergoes a process in which the protein clumps together in a way that harms the heart cells, called liquid-liquid phase separation. This process promotes cardiac damage from increased inflammation and cell death, making the heart less likely to function well after transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing damage with a common drug</strong></h2>



<p>To test whether the process could be prevented, the researchers treated donor hearts with a drug called canrenone, which blocks mineralocorticoid receptor activity. In human donor hearts stored beyond the typical timeframe, treatment with the drug nearly tripled their pumping strength compared to hearts stored without it. The hearts also showed better blood flow and fewer signs of cell injury. The findings suggest canrenone may help extend the safe storage period for donor hearts by improving the heart’s pumping strength to increase chances of a successful transplant.</p>



<p>"As a cardiovascular surgeon, I’ve personally experienced in the operating room how every additional hour of preservation can impact the likelihood of whether a donor heart can return to normal function after transplantation," Dr. Tang says. "This discovery may give us a new tool to preserve heart function for longer during storage, improve transplant outcomes and enhance patient access to lifesaving transplants."</p>



<p>The study's findings also have the potential to improve the preservation of other transplantable organs. Similar protein clustering was observed in donor kidneys, lungs and livers during cold storage. This suggests that the same strategy may help expand transplant options across multiple organ systems.</p>

<p-->For graduate students aiming to become scientists, Mayo Clinic's biomedical research training environment fosters a certain kind of thinking: How can new knowledge eventually improve the treatment of disease? "As students, we see the integration of research and patient care and what you can learn from both sides of the picture," says Ph.D. candidate Carli Stewart.<p></p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="667" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Stewart-Carli-M._30027020_202008250417.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402611" style="width:253px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Stewart-Carli-M._30027020_202008250417.jpg 667w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Stewart-Carli-M._30027020_202008250417-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 667px) 100vw, 667px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Carli Stewart</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For Stewart, the desire to become a scientist began at home. From a young age, she was aware of her father's diagnosis with cancer and the struggles he faced as his body became resistant to some treatments. Four years ago, when she became a predoctoral student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, she chose a research project addressing blood cancers like his.</p>



<p>Working under the mentorship of Mayo Clinic hematologist oncologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, she has studied specially engineered immune cells, called chimeric antigen receptor-T cells or CAR-T cells, that are used to treat blood cancers like leukemia. She identified a signaling protein that, when neutralized, boosts the function of CAR-T cells by keeping them from reaching a state of "exhaustion." She and Dr. Kenderian's team published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51978-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their findings</a> in Nature Communications.</p>



<p>Stewart was delighted to learn that the journey of the new concept didn't stop there. "The approach she explored is novel, and her findings show there's a solid rationale to see whether it may help patients," says Dr. Kenderian.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'An incredible learning curve'</strong></h2>



<p>As the opportunity to advance the idea has emerged, Stewart has begun to learn about developing a clinical trial. "It's been an incredible learning curve," she says of taking a discovery beyond the lab space.</p>



<p>Close collaboration between researchers and clinicians at Mayo is what makes the steps of translation — from discovery to the clinic — happen efficiently, says Dr. Kenderian. Students like Stewart have opportunities to learn about the steps that shape clinical trials to bring new treatments to patients.</p>



<p>She and Dr. Kenderian met with a panel of Mayo physicians to get feedback about the design of a phase 1 clinical trial, which tests the safety of a new approach in a small cohort of patients who are interested in participating. "It was a great opportunity for me to hear how things are translated into the clinic, what questions and concerns clinicians may have, and how feasible our approach may be," she says.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy can be remarkable for some patients who have no other options, and the hope is to develop a more durable, lasting approach. This part of the research is still in early stages, but it's a very exciting project, and I feel lucky to be a part of it."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Beyond what seemed possible'</strong></h2>



<p>Many Ph.D. students at Mayo Clinic are preparing for future careers in academia and industry. Another way they can learn about research that involves human participants is through an internship at Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/offices/office-of-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Clinical Trials</a>. Working with Mayo's clinical trials coordinators, students have followed a clinical trial underway and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/learning-the-ropes-of-clinical-trials-to-bring-cures-to-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned about designing a study</a> that provides meaningful data and protects the rights, safety and welfare of patients who volunteer to participate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Sirpilla-Olivia-L._30026831_20241104.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402613" style="width:258px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Sirpilla-Olivia-L._30026831_20241104.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Sirpilla-Olivia-L._30026831_20241104-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Olivia Sirpilla</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But for some students, like Olivia Sirpilla, who is graduating in May from Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, a long series of successful experiments in Dr. Kenderian's lab has opened the door to the next stages. Sirpilla's Ph.D. research looked at developing specially engineered stem cells from fat tissue as a treatment to calm the inflammation that occurs in immune diseases.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team's results</a>, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, have set the stage for two potential clinical trials. One may be applicable to graft-versus-host-disease, an immune system complication that can occur after a stem cell transplant. The findings also may be applicable to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly for patients who no longer respond to medications.</p>



<p>To design these clinical trials, Sirpilla and Dr. Kenderian are working with teams of Mayo clinicians who specialize in these disorders and their standard treatments. "I chose to come to Mayo Clinic for my Ph.D. to conduct lab research that would be highly translational," she says. "But to spend my thesis work developing a new cell therapy platform that is ready to be translated into a clinical trial is beyond what I thought possible in a Ph.D."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research that reaches patients' daily lives &nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Stephanie Zawada began her Ph.D. with an interest in computational approaches to research, but she has always strived to make advances that reach patients' daily lives.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Zawada-Stephanie-K._30026706_202501151428.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402614" style="width:261px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Zawada-Stephanie-K._30026706_202501151428.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Zawada-Stephanie-K._30026706_202501151428-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stephanie Zawada</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Her thesis project aimed to help physicians assess people who have experienced a stroke and may be at risk for another. &nbsp;She engaged two Ph.D. mentors who shared their expertise: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/demaerschalk-bart-m-m-d/bio-20507430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bart Demaerschalk, M.D.</a>, &nbsp;and &nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/erickson-bradley-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-00077505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Erickson, M.D., Ph.D.</a> Dr. Demaerschalk is a professor of neurology who treats patients with stroke at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and has a longstanding interest in digital health and using telemedicine to reach remote patients, and Dr. Erickson is a professor of radiology who leads artificial intelligence studies at his lab at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.</p>



<p>Zawada "took a very innovative approach, exploring digital tools that may help a healthcare team continue to monitor and evaluate patients who have been discharged from the hospital but remain at risk for stroke recurrence," says Dr. Demaerschalk.</p>



<p>First, Zawada scoured available databases to identify attributes, including mood changes and sleep patterns, that can signal an oncoming stroke and can be captured by smartphone-based technology known as "wearables." Then she worked with her mentors and members of the Center for Digital Health to develop a pilot clinical trial with patients who volunteered to participate in a study from their homes.</p>



<p>Zawada designed a study that met the requirements of an institutional review board, or IRB, to address regulatory compliance. Aiming to get information from a "real-world" setting — where patients interact with app-based tools and the tools account for the range of daily activities — added logistical and mathematical complexity to the project. She worked with Dr. Demaerschalk and Mayo Clinic hospital-based stroke teams to recruit a cohort of 35 patients who gave consent to be part of the clinical trial. &nbsp;</p>



<p>"Interacting with patients and hearing their concerns is the best way to advance useful technologies," Zawada says of designing the trial. "You want the clinical trial process to be as simple as possible for participants, and the only way to learn what tools and designs can make their lives better is to listen to them."</p>



<p>Her <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/11/3595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results showed</a> that several behavioral and mood changes related to cerebrovascular disease can be captured with the use of wearable devices, even from patients going about their daily routines far from a hospital. The approach will need further investigation as a strategy to improve care and in the development of clinical trial measures, but the training to conduct a clinical trial is something that Zawada will take to the next stages of her career. </p>



<p>"Setting up a clinical trial is a complex process and really involves a team," says Zawada, who graduates in May and plans to continue researching wearables for patients who have other severe health conditions. "My thesis project was a multi-site collaborative effort — putting together the clinical questions, the new technology and the data analysis, the connection with patients — it's why I came to train at Mayo in the first place. As a student, I couldn't have done this project anywhere else."</p>
