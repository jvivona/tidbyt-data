<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Every year, some mothers die after giving birth due to heart problems, and many of these deaths could be prevented. The ability to screen for heart weakness before pregnancy could play a crucial role in identifying women who may need additional care to improve pregnancy outcomes. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers, led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kinaszczuk-anja-m-d-o/bio-20490717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anja Kinaszczuk, D.O.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.D.</a>, tested artificial intelligence (AI) tools, using recordings from an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a> and a digital stethoscope, to find unknown heart problems in women of childbearing age seen in primary care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.230627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Study findings</a> published in the Annals of Family Medicine show high diagnostic performance of these technologies to detect <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left ventricular ejection fraction</a> below 50%, indicating heart muscle weakness. These tools were tested on two groups of women aged 18 to 49.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Group 1: 100 women already scheduled for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a> (the best test to evaluate heart muscle function). They also had a standard clinical ECG and digital stethoscope recording of the heart’s electrical activity and heart sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Group 2: 100 women seen for routine primary care visits to see how often the AI tools would find heart problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The AI-ECG demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of .94 while the AI digital stethoscope, Eko DUO, achieved an even higher AUC of 0.98, indicating strong diagnostic accuracy. In the second cohort, the prevalence of positive AI screening results was 1% for the AI-ECG and 3.2% for the AI-stethoscope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Statistically, nearly half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and approximately 1% to 2% of women may have heart problems they don't know about. Our research findings suggest that these AI tools could be used to screen women before pregnancy, allowing for improved pregnancy planning and risk stratification, early treatment, and better health outcomes which addresses a critical gap in current maternal care," says Dr. Adedinsewo, a cardiologist and senior author of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This research builds upon earlier published studies, including a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38989045/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot prospective study</a> evaluating AI digital tools to detect pregnancy-related cardiomyopathy among obstetric patients in the U.S. and a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03243-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pragmatic randomized clinical trial</a> of women in Nigeria who were pregnant or had recently given birth. Collectively, this research highlights the potential of AI to modernize cardiovascular screening, enabling earlier identification and management of heart muscle weakness in women of reproductive age. Further research is underway to explore the potential of using these technologies to screen for heart weakness in broader populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has licensed the underlying technology to EKO Health for its digital stethoscope with embedded ECG electrodes and to Anumana for the 12-lead ECG. Mayo Clinic and some study authors have a financial interest in this technology. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a potential new way to monitor the progression of high-grade gliomas, one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer. Their feasibility study suggests that a personalized blood test tailored to each patient's tumor DNA could provide a faster and less invasive way to determine if the cancer is advancing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, clinicians rely on scans and surgical biopsies to monitor gliomas, but both methods have limitations. For example, scans often cannot distinguish tumor growth from treatment effects such as inflammation. Biopsies require invasive procedures, making them impractical for routine monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new approach, published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3233/754481/Personalized-Tumor-Specific-Amplified-DNA?searchresult=1">Clinical Cancer Research</a>, may provide clinicians with another tool to monitor tumor changes over time and adjust treatment as needed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracking DNA fragments of gliomas</strong></h2>



<p>The findings focus on tumor DNA fragments circulating in the blood. As gliomas grow, some glioma cells die, shedding pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream and leaving behind genetic markers that are unique to the tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, gliomas release fewer DNA fragments into the blood compared to many other cancers. This is because of the blood-brain barrier, a natural brain defense that prevents many substances from leaving the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="569" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/glial-cells-1024x569.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402229" style="width:433px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/glial-cells-1024x569.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/glial-cells-300x167.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/glial-cells-768x427.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/glial-cells-1536x853.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/glial-cells-2048x1138.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Illustration of glial cells, the brain cells that form gliomas. Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To overcome this limitation, researchers focused on DNA junctions, a type of tumor-specific DNA fragment that is present in higher quantities. By targeting these markers, researchers achieved greater sensitivity, enabling them to detect even the smallest signs of tumor progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike normal DNA, which follows a structured sequence, these DNA junctions form when the tumor's genetic material breaks and rearranges. The study found that these amplified DNA junctions, due to their higher numbers, may provide a clearer picture of disease progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research builds on years of studying genetic rearrangements and gives us a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving gliomas," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vasmatzis-george-ph-d/bio-00027811">George Vasmatzis, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author of the study and co-director of the Biomarker Discovery Program at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "It offers new possibilities for patient-specific monitoring and targeted interventions."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Detecting tumor DNA</strong></h2>



<p>In the study, researchers analyzed samples from patients with high-grade gliomas. They used whole genome sequencing to map each tumor's unique genetic blueprint and pinpointed patient-specific DNA junctions. Researchers then developed personalized blood tests to search for these genetic markers in plasma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. In some patients, tumor DNA levels in the blood rose before MRI scans showed any changes — offering a potential early signal for disease progression.</p>



<p>Dr. Vasmatzis collaborated with Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/burns-terry-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20238358">Terry Burns, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and clinical practice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"By tracking each tumor's distinct molecular signature, we're aiming to shift from a reactive approach to one that's far more proactive," says Dr. Burns, a co-author of the study. "This research could lay the groundwork for tools that help clinicians make the most informed treatment decisions as early as possible."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future studies will evaluate how well blood-based tumor tracking correlates with glioma progression across a larger group of patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a> have made a groundbreaking discovery: a rare genetic variant that can directly cause metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is one of the most common diseases in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until now, scientists believed the disease resulted from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. This study, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/hep/abstract/9900/discovery_of_a_met_driven_monogenic_cause_of.1151.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Hepatology</a>, reveals that in some cases, a single inherited variant can be the primary driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers identified this variant in the MET<em> </em>gene, which regulates liver repair and fat metabolism. When the gene malfunctions, fat accumulates in liver cells and triggers inflammation. Over time, this leads to fibrosis and scarring, which stiffens the liver. In severe cases, the disease progresses to cirrhosis, resulting in irreversible liver damage or liver cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease affects about one-third of adults worldwide. Its advanced form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, is expected to become the leading cause of cirrhosis and the reason for liver transplants in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This discovery opens a window into how rare inherited genetic variants can drive common diseases," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pinto-e-vairo-filippo-m-d-ph-d/bio-20503559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author and medical director of the Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine. "It provides new insights into this disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for future research."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A hidden error in the genetic code</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402212" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-1024x576.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-300x169.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-768x432.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-1536x864.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The discovery emerged from the genomic data of a woman and her father with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. They had no history of diabetes or high cholesterol, two common risk factors for fat buildup in the liver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With no clear explanation, researchers examined the DNA from more than 20,000 genes to find answers. They found a small but potentially significant error in the MET gene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In collaboration with the Medical College of Wisconsin's John &amp; Linda Mellowes Center for Genomic Sciences and Precision Medicine, led by <a href="https://www.mcw.edu/departments/surgery/people/raul-a-urrutia-md-academic-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raul Urrutia, M.D.</a>, the scientists determined that the mutation disrupted a critical biological process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Genes are made up of chemical letters that provide instructions for the body's functions. In this case, a single swapped letter — among thousands — scrambled the message, preventing the liver from properly processing fat. This rare variant, found in the family, has not been reported in existing literature or public databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This study demonstrates that rare diseases are not rare but often hidden in the large pool of complex disorders, underscoring the immense power of individualized medicine in identifying them, and enabling the design of advanced diagnostics and targeted therapies," Dr. Urrutia says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracing the genetic variant impact</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-393916" style="width:427px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-1024x576.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-300x169.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-768x432.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-1536x864.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>To explore the variant's broader impact, researchers turned to Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinics-largest-ever-exome-study-offers-blueprint-for-biomedical-breakthroughs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapestry study</a>, a large-scale exome sequencing effort aimed at uncovering genomic drivers of disease. The Tapestry study analyzed germline DNA from over 100,000 participants across the U.S., creating a comprehensive genomic data repository that supports research into both well-known and emerging health conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among nearly 4,000 adult Tapestry participants with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, about 1% carried rare, potentially causative variants in the same MET gene. Of these, nearly 18% had variants in the same critical region as the initial woman and her father, further supporting its role in liver disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)"><blockquote><p>"This finding highlights the profound value of studying familial diseases and the merit of large-scale genomic datasets, which can reveal rare genetic variations with broader implications for population health."</p><cite>Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.d.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"This finding could potentially affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people worldwide with or at risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</a>, a lead author and the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for the Center for Individualized Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis emphasized the significance of this discovery as it relates to the Tapestry study's impactful contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Once a pathogenic variant is discovered, interrogating our Tapestry data repository is giving us a clearer lens into the hidden layers of disease, and this discovery is one of the first to demonstrate its scientific significance," Dr. Lazaridis says. "This finding highlights the profound value of studying familial diseases and the merit of large-scale genomic datasets, which can reveal rare genetic variations with broader implications for population health."&nbsp;</p>

<p>This discovery also reflects the importance of integrating genomics into clinical care at Mayo Clinic, where teams use advanced technologies to help solve complex medical mysteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2019, the Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases has helped more than 3,200 patients with complex and serious conditions gain access to comprehensive genomic testing. It collaborates with nearly 300 clinicians from 14 divisions across the enterprise to bring precision diagnostics to patients with rare conditions, including rare liver diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future studies will explore how this genomic discovery in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease can inform targeted treatments and improve disease management.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new Mayo Clinic study finds that people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tourette-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tourette syndrome</a> have about half as many of a specific type of brain cell that helps calm overactive movement signals as people without the condition. This deficit may be a key reason why their motor signals go unchecked, leading to the involuntary tics that define the disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(25)00064-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Published in Biological Psychiatry,</a> the study is the first to analyze individual brain cells from people with Tourette disorder. The findings also shed light on how different types of brain cells may interact in ways that contribute to the syndrome's symptoms.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"This research may help lay the foundation for a new generation of treatments," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/abyzov-alexej-ph-d/bio-20089449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexej Abyzov, Ph.D.</a>, a genomic scientist in <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a> and a co-author of the study. "If we can understand how these brain cells are altered and how they interact, we may be able to intervene earlier and more precisely."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tourette disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that typically begins in childhood. It causes repeated, involuntary movements and vocalizations such as eye blinking, throat clearing or facial grimacing. Nearly 1 in 162 children in the U.S. have Tourette syndrome, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tourette-syndrome/data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Centers for Disease Control</a>. While genetic studies have identified some risk genes, the biological mechanisms behind the condition have remained unclear.&nbsp;</p>

Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To better understand what's happening in the brain with Tourette syndrome, Dr. Abyzov and his team analyzed more than 43,000 individual cells from postmortem brain tissue of&nbsp;people with and without the condition. </p>



<p>They focused on the basal ganglia, a region of the brain that helps control movement and behavior. In each cell, they looked at how genes were working. They also analyzed how changes in the brain's gene-control systems might trigger stress and inflammation.</p>



<p>First, they found in people with Tourette syndrome a 50% reduction in interneurons. These brain cells help calm excess signals in the brain's movement circuits.</p>



<p>They also observed stress responses in two other brain cell types. Medium spiny neurons make up most of the cells in basal ganglia. They help send movement signals and showed reduced energy production. Microglia, the brain's immune cells, showed inflammation. The researchers found a close link between the two responses, suggesting the cells may interact in Tourette disorder.</p>

<p>"We're seeing different types of brain cells reacting to stress and possibly communicating with each other in ways that could be driving symptoms," says Yifan Wang, Ph.D., co-author of the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study points to changes in DNA regions that control when genes turn on and off as a possible cause of brain cell changes in Tourette disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Tourette patients seem to have the same functional genes as everyone else but the coordination between them is broken," says Dr. Abyzov.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the researchers plan to study how these brain changes develop over time and look for genetic factors that may help explain the disorder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A study published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brain Communications</a> highlights a new approach to treating drug-resistant epilepsy. Researchers at Mayo Clinic have developed an innovative <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS) platform that was used to not only reduce seizures, but also improve memory and sleep — two common challenges for patients with epilepsy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epilepsy</a>, a seizure disorder that affects about 50 million people worldwide, often disrupts memory, emotions and sleep. Many cases are drug-resistant, leaving people with limited treatment options. Researchers at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> found that low-frequency DBS not only reduced seizures, but it also improved memory and sleep.</p>



<p>"Using an implanted investigational device, the team continuously monitored brain activity with AI-driven seizure and sleep tracking," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/worrell-gregory-a-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Worrell, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic neurologist and co-lead author of the study. "A cloud-based platform simultaneously assessed participants' behavior, memory and mood at home. This real-time data enables precise tuning of stimulation settings, maximizing benefits while minimizing side effects."</p>



<p>"By using an implanted device that continuously monitors brain activity, we can detect seizures more accurately than patient-reported diaries in order to optimize deep brain stimulation in real-time and improve treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kremen-vaclav-ph-d-m-s/bio-20473935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaclav Kremen, Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic researcher and co-lead author of the study.</p>



<p>The researchers monitored five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy throughout their DBS treatment. The system allowed patients to track their brain activity and symptoms remotely, providing doctors with detailed, real-world data to fine-tune treatments. This technology could lead to more effective treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy and could be expanded to treat other neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>



<p>"Our study demonstrates the potential of emerging neurotechnology to treat human disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/van-gompel-jamie-j-m-d/bio-20249290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Van Gompel, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon and co-author of the study.</p>



<p>"Combining neuroscience, engineering and artificial intelligence, our work is paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments for epilepsy and other brain disorders," says Dr. Worrell.</p>



<p>The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health — National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the CLARA project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program.&nbsp; The implanted devices were donated by Medtronic as part of the National Institutes of Health Brain Initiative Public-Private Partnership.</p>

<p>When Vicki Tennant came to Mayo Clinic for answers about her heart condition, she never expected to be at the center of a medical breakthrough. But her case led Mayo Clinic researchers to identify a previously undetectable genetic phenomenon.</p>



<p>Most genetic diseases are linked to protein-coding regions, which is also where standard testing has been focused. The discovery based on Tennant's case, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.124.012632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Circulation: Heart Failure</a>, was that disease-causing variants can hide in areas of DNA that don't make proteins. </p>



<p>Specifically, a tiny glitch in one of these regions, combined with a known mutation, was enough to cause Tennant's disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The level of care and expertise at Mayo Clinic is something I've never experienced," Tennant says. "It’s amazing to think that what they found in me could change how doctors diagnose others."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A clue hidden in the heart</strong></h2>



<p>In her home state of Iowa, Tennant had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a genetic condition that thickens the heart muscle and increases the risk of heart failure. But her case didn't follow the usual pattern.</p>



<p>She had an irregular heartbeat that required several procedures to restore a normal rhythm, and she had also had a stroke. Her cardiologist in Iowa referred her to Mayo Clinic for further evaluation.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, what began as a closer look at Tennant’s heart tissue by cardiologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/geske-jeffrey-b-m-d/bio-00092430">Jeffrey Geske, M.D.</a>, quickly gained momentum. Pathologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/maleszewski-joseph-j-m-d/bio-20095734">Joseph Maleszewski, M.D.</a>, examined the biopsy and identified microscopic abnormalities that indicated the need for further investigation.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Tennant underwent a routine gallbladder surgery in Iowa. A liver biopsy performed during that procedure also revealed abnormalities, prompting Tennant to ask her Mayo team to review the findings. That request helped deepen the investigation into the underlying cause of her health issues.</p>



<p>When standard clinical genetic testing did not yield an answer, Dr. Geske asked <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20178506">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a>, a cardiovascular genomicist, to take a closer look at Tennant's DNA. Dr. Pereira searched Tennant's genome for hidden patterns and anomalies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)"><blockquote><p>"This discovery highlights the strength of integrating advanced genomic science with clinical expertise to solve some of medicine's most complex mysteries."</p><cite>Naveen Pereira, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>He found that Tennant had one known disease-causing mutation in a gene responsible for producing an enzyme that prevents substances from accumulating in the cell. Normally, two mutations are needed to cause a genetic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA. But something still didn't add up — besides having only one variant, Tennant lacked some of the typical symptoms of the disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Pereira conducted additional lab tests to check for signs of the condition in her cells, however, which led to confirming it as her diagnosis.</p>



<p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA usually appears in early childhood and causes progressive neurological decline. But Tennant, in her 40s, had no signs of neurological issues. In her, the condition showed up as heart disease — an unexpected and atypical presentation that added to the mystery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A genetic mystery unfolds</strong></h2>



<p>With unanswered questions remaining, Dr. Pereira expanded the team, bringing in experts from <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pinto-e-vairo-filippo-m-d-ph-d/bio-20503559">Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic’s Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, the Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director of Research and Innovation; and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lambert-laura-j-ph-d/bio-20545313">Laura Lambert, Ph.D.</a>, director of the Functional Omics Resource Laboratory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="906" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-1024x906.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-401914" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-1024x906.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-300x265.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-768x679.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert.jpg 1038w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Some of the Mayo Clinic experts who helped uncover the hidden genetic cause behind a rare heart condition. Top row, from left: Jeffrey Geske, M.D; Naveen Pereira, M.D.; Laura Lambert, Ph.D.; Bottom row, from left: Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D.; Eric Klee, Ph.D.</em>; Joseph Maleszewski, M.D.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The team applied advanced sequencing and analysis methods to search beyond the usual areas of the genome. That's when they made another discovery.</p>



<p>"We found a variant in a stretch of DNA located between two genes — it's a region often missed by standard genetic testing because it doesn't code for proteins," says Dr. Pinto e Vairo. "Now we had to prove it was actually disrupting how the gene worked and contributing to the disease in our patient."</p>



<p>To validate the finding, Dr. Lambert and the Functional Omics Resource Laboratory team used innovative, light-based methods to test whether the DNA change was interfering with how the gene worked.</p>



<p>"This gave us the functional proof we needed to confirm that this variant was actually causing disease," Dr. Lambert says.</p>



<p>Combined with the known mutation previously identified by Dr. Pereira, this hidden change provided the missing explanation for Tennant's condition.</p>



<p>"This finding is a testament to the transformative potential of looking beyond the expected," Dr. Klee says. "It underscores how advancements in genomics and technology are enhancing our ability to understand the impact of an increasing number of genetic changes."</p>



<p>Together, these insights revealed an entirely new way genetic disease can emerge and take shape.</p>



<p>"This discovery highlights the strength of integrating advanced genomic science with clinical expertise to solve some of medicine's most complex mysteries," says Dr. Pereira. "This finding could help change our approach and diagnose other patients with unexplained conditions, and expand the scope of precision medicine."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A long-awaited answer</strong></h2>



<p>For Tennant, the discovery has provided long-sought clarity. She enjoys working on her farm, spending time outdoors and operating her tractor — all activities she now approaches with a deeper understanding of her health.</p>



<p>While there is no cure for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA with cardiac involvement, her diagnosis allows for more precise monitoring and offers hope for potential future treatments, including gene therapy.</p>



<p>"I also hope this helps someone else," Tennant says. "If sharing my story means someone gets diagnosed sooner, then it's all worth it."</p>

<p>"I started having the seizures, noticeable seizures, and from there, it just started getting worse and worse," recalls Anthony.</p>



<p>It began after Anthony graduated from high school. He was making plans for his future and looking forward to attending college. That's when the seizures began.</p>



<p>Initially, the seizures were mild but quickly became more severe. "The experience (seizure) is like a loss of time, like a blank spot in your memory — like you're waking up without any recollection of what happened," says Anthony.</p>



<p>"The seizures were several times a week. His lips would be blue. His mouth would be blue," says Patricia Maita, Anthony's mother. "It so hard to see your child go through that and feel so helpless."</p>



<p>Doctors tried to manage Anthony's seizures with medication, but nothing worked. Eventually Anthony was diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy, or DRE.</p>

<p>Of those diagnosed with epilepsy, approximately 30%, or 15 million people, are considered medication-resistant. Uncontrolled seizures often rob many people of their ability to live and function independently.</p>



<p>While it is rare, seizures can lead to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, or SUDEP. "We know that more frequent seizures mean the patient is at higher risk of SUDEP, so that's why we are very aggressive about treating epilepsy with all the tools we have available," says Dr. Parker.</p>



<p>Current treatment options for patients with DRE include surgical procedures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain resection</a>&nbsp;to remove a portion of the brain tissue responsible for generating seizures. A less invasive procedure involves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser ablation</a>&nbsp;therapy that pinpoints and destroys abnormal brain tissue. While often effective, these surgical approaches carry the risk of possible side effects, such as memory impairment, motor deficits and speech difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Parker is the lead investigator of the first-in-human clinical trial at Mayo Clinic which studies the use of implanted specialized inhibitory brain cells as a potential reparative treatment for DRE.&nbsp;Dr. Parker's clinical trial is underway in Arizona.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic in Arizona&nbsp;is one of 29 sites nationwide participating in the inhibitory brain cell implant clinical trial for patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focal epilepsy</a>, where seizures originate in a specific region of the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anthony became Mayo Clinic's first patient to undergo the investigational brain cell implant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We use a very minimally invasive technique where we inject the inhibitory cells through a pencil eraser-sized incision in the back of the head. Our hope is that, over time, these cells become part of the brain and help repair the neural circuitry, and reduce or prevent seizures without the side effects," says Dr. Parker. The cells are implanted in a one-time, single-dose procedure.</p>

<p>"Honestly, it was pretty easy," says Anthony. "I had no trouble with it." Anthony was discharged from the hospital the next day.</p>



<p>Doctors say it is still too early to determine whether the brain cell implant was effective, but they are hopeful. </p>

<p>The clinical trial involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells, a type of adult stem cell that has anti-inflammatory properties. MSCs may also support tissue repair and healing. Further scientific research is needed to confirm their therapeutic potential in the field of regenerative medicine.</p>

<p>Dr. Zubair's research teams have developed a cost-effective method of producing MSCs for use in potential treatments for conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/groundbreaking-studies-of-regenerative-medicine-treatment-for-intracerebral-hemorrhage/mac-20552299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>. </p>

</div></div>



<p>Dr. Zubair has several research projects scheduled to launch into space in 2025.</p>



<p>"MSCs are what we call multipotent, meaning they can differentiate into different cell types based on where they're placed. If they are placed near blood vessels, they can become blood vessel types. If they're placed by heart cells, they can become heart cell types," explains Dr. Grewal. </p>



<p>The hope is the MSCs eventually become neural or brain cell types and interact in the part of the brain where the seizures occur. "It's called paracrine signaling, where they're releasing signals to the brain tissue around them and interacting in a way to try to repair that tissue."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"I'm willing to try everything and anything to get some sort of control over these seizures because I've been living with this for so long."</strong></p><cite>Tabitha Wilson, Clinical Trial participant</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Since undergoing the procedure, there has been an improvement in Tabitha's seizure management. However, Dr. Grewal says it is too early to know whether this is due to the deep brain stimulation, stem cells or both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drs. Grewal and Parker say there is still a long road ahead to determine whether these cell therapies are proven safe and effective for patients with DRE. But they agree each day brings them one step closer to a potential treatment or cure for patients like Tabitha and Anthony.</p>



<p>"We've thought about this for generations, we just didn't have these technologies to enable it. Now we do," says Dr. Grewal. "So, whether it's wound healing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/deep-learning-fuels-neurodegenerative-disease-research/mac-20545173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurodegeneration</a>, epilepsy or&nbsp;stroke, there are so many different studies going on investigating the potential of regenerative or reparative therapies."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;is taking epilepsy research in a bold new direction, exploring treatment approaches to help patients living with the most severe and difficult-to-treat forms of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">epilepsy</a>. About 50 million people worldwide are impacted by epilepsy. Approximately 30% of patients, or about 15 million people, suffer with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). While some patients experience only a few&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20365711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seizures</a>&nbsp;per month, others may endure hundreds each day — ranging from episodes that are mild to life-threatening.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Current treatment options for patients with DRE include surgical procedures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain resection</a>&nbsp;to remove a portion of the brain tissue responsible for generating seizures. A less invasive procedure involves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser ablation</a>&nbsp;therapy that pinpoints and destroys abnormal brain tissue. While often effective, these surgical approaches carry the risk of possible side effects, such as memory impairment, motor deficits and speech difficulties.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neuromodulation</a>&nbsp;is another surgical approach that uses electrical or magnetic stimulation to interrupt abnormal neural activity without removing brain tissue.</p>



<p>Now, a growing number of scientists across the globe are part of an innovative trend in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research</a>&nbsp;investigating novel ways to DRE. It involves the use of regenerative medicine as a "reparative" approach to help the brain heal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neurosurgeon&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parker-jonathon-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20537491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonathon J. Parker, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is the lead investigator of the first-in-human clinical trial at Mayo Clinic studying the use of implanted specialized inhibitory brain cells as a potential reparative treatment for DRE. The clinical trial is underway at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>.</p>



<p>"This is an exciting time for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a>&nbsp;and the potential it may have for millions of people who suffer from the debilitating side effects of DRE," says Dr. Parker. "We use a very minimally invasive technique where we inject the inhibitory cells through a pencil eraser-sized incision in the back of the head. Our hope is that, over time, these cells become part of the brain and help repair the neural circuitry, and reduce or prevent seizures without the side effects," says Dr. Parker.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic in Arizona&nbsp;is one of 29 sites nationwide participating in the inhibitory brain cell implant clinical trial for patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focal epilepsy</a>, where seizures originate in a specific region of the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Arizona resident Anthony Maita was the first person at Mayo Clinic to participate in the clinical trial. He underwent the one-time, single-dose procedure and was discharged from the hospital the next day. "I had no trouble with it," says Anthony. "My biggest hope is that, one day, I don't have to deal with this. My other biggest hope is that other people won't have to either."</p>



<p>It is still too early to determine whether the brain cell implant was effective for Anthony. Doctors are monitoring his progress closely. "Anthony has been doing great since the procedure," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/crepeau-amy-z-m-d/bio-20087246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Crepeau, M.D.</a>, neurologist at Mayo Clinic. "We have a great deal of optimism in regard to the potential of this brain cell therapy. Developing a safe and effective, minimally invasive treatment that does not carry the possible negative side effects could be a game changer in treating patients with DRE and improving their quality of life."</p>



<p>Another clinical trial is underway at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>&nbsp;investigating the potential of regenerative medicine as a reparative treatment for DRE. Researchers are exploring the use of implanted stem cells in conjunction with neuromodulation.</p>



<p>One of the most recent FDA-approved methods of neuromodulation therapy for epilepsy is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep brain stimulation</a>. While patients who undergo deep brain stimulation experience median seizure reduction up to 70% after five years, it is uncommon for patients to become seizure-free.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/grewal-sanjeet-s-m-d/bio-20489678" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanjeet Grewal, M.D.</a>, director of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/epilepsy-subspecialty-group/overview/ovc-20441647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stereotactic and functional neurosurgery</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic, is hoping to change that. "Unfortunately, neuromodulation doesn't give us the seizure freedom we want, and that's why we are trying to combine deep brain stimulation with stem cell therapy to see if we can increase the efficacy of neuromodulation," says Dr. Grewal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Grewal is the lead investigator of the clinical trial which involves the use of implanted adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as an adjunct to deep brain stimulation for DRE patients. MSCs are a special type of adult stem cell with anti-inflammatory properties that may also have potential for healing. </p>



<p>Many, like Dr. Grewal, hope MSCs will serve a pivotal role in the future of regenerative medicine to treat conditions like epilepsy. "There are some patients whose seizures are just much harder to treat with the technology we have today. Our hope is that by adding stem cells and their regenerative potential, we can increase treatment success," says Dr. Grewal.</p>



<p>The clinical trial is using MSCs derived from fat tissue and produced at the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Cell Therapy Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic in Florida under the leadership of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abba Zubair, M.D., Ph.D.</a> His research teams have developed a cost-effective method of producing MSCs for use in potential treatments for conditions such as stroke and osteoporosis. "My mission is to discover ways to address problems that patients have been struggling with and find a solution for them. I want to give them hope," says Dr. Zubair. "I truly believe the future is bright."</p>



<p>"MSCs are what we call multipotent, meaning they can differentiate into different cell types based on where they're placed. If they are placed near blood vessels, they can become blood vessel types. If they're placed by heart cells, they can become heart cell types," explains Dr. Grewal. It is hoped the MSCs in Dr. Grewal's clinical trial will become neural or brain cell types and interact in the part of the brain where seizures occur. "It's called paracrine signaling, where they're releasing signals to the brain tissue around them and interacting in a way to try to repair that tissue."</p>



<p>Tabitha Wilson began having seizures at the age of 2. The Florida resident says her seizures were well controlled until her mid-20s when her medication stopped working. Tabitha tried numerous other medications and underwent three&nbsp;<a href="https://careinfo.mayoclinic.org/epilepsy-mn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain surgeries</a>, none of which provided the relief she needed.</p>



<p>"There are days when I'll have two, three or four seizures, back-to-back," says Tabitha. "I fell down a flight of stairs. I've burned myself while cooking. I've completely blacked out and don’t know where I am." Like many people who have epilepsy, Tabitha says uncontrolled seizures have robbed her ability to live independently. "I can't drive, can't cook or swim alone. I can't take a bath, only a shower and someone has to be in the house," says Tabitha.</p>



<p>Tabitha became the first person to participate in the Florida clinical trial. Dr. Grewal says she is also the first person in the world to undergo surgery for deep brain stimulation and receive stem cell therapy in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/in-depth/brain/art-20546821#:~:text=The%20inner%20brain&amp;text=The%20thalamus%20acts%20as%20a,The%20hypothalamus%20controls%20emotions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thalamus</a>&nbsp;in her brain as a potential treatment for DRE. "I'm willing to try everything and anything to get some sort of control over these seizures because I've been living with this for so long," says Tabitha. "I hope to be a mother someday."</p>



<p>Since the surgery, Dr. Grewal says there has been an improvement in Tabitha's seizure management. However, he says it is too early to know whether this is due to the deep brain stimulation, stem cells or both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drs. Grewal and Parker say there is a long road ahead to determine whether these cell therapies are proven safe and effective for patients with DRE. But they agree each day brings them one step closer to a potential treatment or even a cure for patients like Tabitha and Anthony. </p>



<p>"We've thought about this for generations, we just didn't have these technologies to enable it. Now we do," says Dr. Grewal. "So, whether it's wound healing, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/deep-learning-fuels-neurodegenerative-disease-research/mac-20545173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurodegeneration</a>, epilepsy or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>, there are so many different studies going on investigating the potential of regenerative or reparative therapies."</p>

<p><br>Mayo Clinic operates one of the largest clinical laboratories in the world. More than 87,000 samples pass through the labs from Mayo Clinic patients and Mayo Clinic Laboratories' clients per day. At <a href="https://www.mayocliniclabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Laboratories</a> and the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology</a> (DLMP), these thousands of samples are tested for a large swath of molecules that can signal disease. Additionally, Mayo Clinic physicians and researchers develop new diagnostic tests every year. The innovation and capability to improve medicine fuels the work of clinical pathologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pandey-akhilesh-m-d-ph-d/bio-20488636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Akhilesh Pandey, M.D., Ph.D.</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The fact that we, as researchers, can find a new biomarker associated with a disease, develop a test to find it sooner and implement it into clinical practice, places Mayo Clinic at the forefront of the medicine of the future," he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Pandey's multidisciplinary research team consists of chemists and biochemists, molecular and computational biologists and experts in advanced biomedical instrumentation who push the boundaries of technology to develop more powerful tests to help detect and diagnose diseases earlier.</p>



<p>"Our lab is focused on problems and technologies where there is a direct and tangible path to discovering new findings that can be put into medicine in many ways, especially in terms of diagnostics. For us, it's all about translating research into the practice," he says.</p>



<p>He collaborates with more than 100 different researchers at Mayo Clinic to achieve this.</p>



<p>"DLMP consultants and staff are continually searching for ways to translate clinically relevant research findings into novel diagnostics that will provide our clinicians and patients the answers they need. Many of these findings come from our own investigators in DLMP or Mayo Clinic, but we also will keep abreast of advances from researchers worldwide. Our track record is impressive due to the efforts and creativity of consultants like Dr. Pandey and so many others," says <a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/2024/05/09/get-to-know-the-dlmp-chair-eric-hsi-m-d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Hsi, M.D.</a>, chair of the Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research and Practice</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<p>One group of genetic disorders that is particularly challenging to diagnose is called sphingolipidosis, which stems from the harmful accumulation of sphingolipids, a type of lipid molecule. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tay-sachs-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20378190" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tay-Sachs disease</a> is a form of sphingolipidosis where these lipids build up in the brain and spinal cord, causing nerve cell damage.</p>



<p>Most tests for sphingolipidosis can only screen for one specific form of the disorder at a time, targeting about 10 molecules, which makes the process laborious and time-consuming for both clinicians and patients.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Pandey and researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/systems-biology-translational-medicine/faculty-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seul Kee Byeon, Ph.D.</a>, heard about this challenge from colleagues in Mayo Clinic's Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology. So they went to work designing a more efficient test.</p>



<p>The result: a single assay that can test for 47 different molecules linked to many kinds of sphingolipidosis, offering more efficient diagnostic testing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a huge gain, especially for clinicians who may suspect a patient has a rare and serious genetic condition but may not know where in the pathway the problem lies," says Dr. Byeon, who is the lead author on a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39206579/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study reporting the findings</a> in the journal Clinical Chemistry.</p>



<p>This new test is still in development but will be rolled out for use in the near future at Mayo Clinic Laboratories. Dr. Byeon is also working on the next iteration of this assay, which would target hundreds of lipids.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From just one cell</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Pandey's research teams in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/systems-biology-translational-medicine/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Systems Biology and Translational Medicine Laboratory</a> and the <a href="https://news.mayocliniclabs.com/2021/07/12/a-sandbox-for-innovation-the-advanced-diagnostic-laboratory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Advanced Diagnostics Laboratory</a> use a sensitive but versatile technique called mass spectrometry to detect, identify and quantify molecules in lab samples, which can come from blood, tissue or other specimens.<br><br>In addition, Dr. Pandey's team conducts research using <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37395315/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-cell proteomics</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39950635/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-cell lipidomics</a>, which can uncover what proteins and lipids, respectively, are present in individual cells. They also apply a rapidly evolving approach called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/spatial-biology-puts-potential-disease-targets-in-their-place/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spatial biology</a> to map where various molecules are in a specific tissue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The information gleaned from these analytical techniques can lead to the discovery of biomarkers for a variety of conditions, from genetic disorders to cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We want to find the next generation of biomarkers and we have the technology to do it," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br>A comprehensive review published by Mayo Clinic researchers advances the understanding of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited form of kidney disease and the fourth leading cause of kidney failure worldwide.</p>



<p>Published in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</a>, the review advances the understanding of ADPKD, which accounts for 5-10% of kidney failure in the U.S. and Europe. Its prevalence in the U.S. is 9.3 cases per 10,000 people.</p>

<p>"This is a vital resource for healthcare providers to stay informed about the latest diagnostic tools and treatment strategies to enhance patient care," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chebib-fouad-t-m-d/bio-20434759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fouad Chebib, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and first author of the review. "It covers how the disease disrupts the normal functioning of the body, signs and symptoms of the disease, diagnosis, treatment and the likely outcome, equipping healthcare providers to manage this complex condition, improving the quality of life through timely, evidence-based care."</p>



<p>Physicians typically diagnose ADPKD in patients who are between the ages of 27 and 42. The disease causes fluid-filled cysts to grow on the kidneys, leading to kidney failure. Over 90% of people over age 35 diagnosed with ADPKD also present with multiple liver cysts, which can cause discomfort or pain.</p>



<p>ADPKD symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience high blood pressure, pain in the back or side, blood in the urine, frequent urinary tract infections and kidney stones.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hypertension affects 70-80% of people with ADPKD, and 9-14% of them develop brain aneurysms (a weakened and bulging area in the wall of a blood vessel), which have a low rupture rate.</p>



<p>A change in one of two genes, PKD1 (78%) or PKD2 (15%), causes most cases of ADPKD. If a person has one of these changes, they have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their children. However, 10-25% of people have a genetic alteration not inherited from either parent.</p>



<p>The review provides practical guidance on managing blood pressure, sodium intake, hydration and lifestyle changes to delay complications such as kidney failure, liver cysts and hypertension to slow disease progression.</p>



<p>A key tool in managing the disease is the Mayo Imaging Classification (MIC), which predicts the severity of the disease based on a person's kidney size and growth rate. Higher MIC classifications indicate faster growth and an earlier need for kidney replacement (dialysis or kidney transplantation). Roughly half of ADPKD patients need kidney replacement therapy by age 62.</p>



<p>The review also explores the use of novel therapies, such as the drug tolvaptan, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow kidney function decline for high-risk adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.</p>

<p>"This drug improves care and paves the way for future therapies that enhance the quality of life and delay kidney failure," explains <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dahl-neera-k-m-d-ph-d/bio-20563449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neera Dahl, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic nephrologist and senior author of the review.</p>



<p>The review recommends that a kidney specialist who manages patients with ADPKD should share decision-making with the patient regarding genetic testing, treatments, monitoring and aneurysm screening. This collaborative approach recognizes the importance of the physician's medical expertise and the patient's values, preferences, and goals. It also says patients with ADPKD should be aware of the symptoms of ruptured aneurysms (sudden, severe headache) and the need for immediate medical attention should they experience those symptoms.</p>
