<p><a href="https://www.regenmedmn.org/">Regenerative Medicine Minnesota</a> has awarded funding to three projects aimed at strengthening Minnesota's capabilities for developing and delivering therapies that replace, restore, rejuvenate or regenerate damaged cells, tissues or organs.</p>



<p>Co-led by the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic, Regenerative Medicine Minnesota brings together the state's leading research institutions to accelerate breakthroughs and bring new therapies to patients across the state.</p>



<p>The funded projects were selected for their potential to overcome challenges that slow the development and delivery of new therapies. Each project aims to build sustainable, widely accessible resources to help move regenerative treatments from the lab to patients more quickly.</p>



<p>The projects are:</p>



<p><strong>Derivation of Induced Pluripotent (Adult) Stem Cell Lines in Minnesota with Superior HLA Compatibility for Manufacturing Clinical Cell Therapy Products</strong></p>



<p>James Dutton, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>This initiative tackles a key challenge in regenerative medicine: access to clinical-grade starting materials. The project will generate high-quality, regulatory-compliant induced pluripotent (adult) stem cell (iPSC) lines with less risk of the immune system rejecting the cells. These lines will be made available to researchers across Minnesota, enabling the development of versatile, cost-effective cell therapies that can benefit a broad range of patients. By building a local supply of standardized starting materials, the project provides a long-term advantage to Minnesota's research community.</p>



<p><br><strong>The Genome Engineering for Regenerative Medicine (GERM) Consortium</strong></p>



<p>David Largaespada, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Addressing the critical need for quality and safety standards in gene-edited therapies, this new consortium will bring together academic and industry experts to establish best practices for gene delivery, editing and evaluation. The GERM Consortium will provide essential guidance and resources to ensure that genetically engineered therapies are developed with precision and safety. Through this collaborative effort, Minnesota will become a hub for innovation and regulatory compliance in cell and gene therapy.</p>



<p><strong>Minnesota BRIDGE — Boosting Regenerative Medicine Innovation through Development, Growth, and Engagement</strong></p>



<p>Melanie Graham, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>This project focuses on a major translational bottleneck: the lack of robust preclinical models. Minnesota BRIDGE will create a state-of-the-art translational research infrastructure that enables more predictive preclinical testing of regenerative therapies. By establishing this capability, Minnesota will become one of the few places in the nation equipped to accelerate therapy development with cutting-edge preclinical models — streamlining the path to clinical trials and patient care.</p>



<p>Together, these projects advance Regenerative Medicine Minnesota's goal of bringing new therapies to patients in Minnesota and beyond while establishing the state as a leader in regenerative medicine.</p>



<p>###</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Simultaneous bariatric surgery and liver transplant for patients who are severely obese is safe and improves long-term health outcomes, according to a recent Mayo Clinic study. This combined approach offers a needed solution for these patients who are often denied a lifesaving liver transplant due to their weight.</p>



<p>The 10-year study, published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827825001394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Hepatology</a>, compared patients who received only a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a> with those who underwent both a liver transplant and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/about/pac-20394258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Julie-Heimbach_WF4419268_0003-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402469" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Julie-Heimbach_WF4419268_0003-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Julie-Heimbach_WF4419268_0003.jpg 534w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Julie Heimbach, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The combined approach resulted in sustained weight loss, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and lower risk of fatty liver disease recurrence. Importantly, the combined procedure posed no additional risks compared to liver transplant alone.</p>



<p>"We've been amazed by the transformation our patients experience," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>, director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a> in Minnesota and the study's senior author. "This dual approach prevents long-term obesity complications like diabetes, heart disease and cancer, while also preventing fatty liver disease recurrence."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How obesity and liver disease are connected</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kellogg-Todd-A.-MD_11728213_201710030353-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402470" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kellogg-Todd-A.-MD_11728213_201710030353-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kellogg-Todd-A.-MD_11728213_201710030353.jpg 667w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Todd Kellogg, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The percentage of liver transplant candidates in the U.S. with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a> continues to climb, with more than 41% of candidates having a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/in-depth/bmi-calculator/itt-20084938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body mass index</a> above 30 in 2022. Obesity puts people at risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, formerly known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</a>. It's a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, scarring and advanced liver disease. Patients with a body mass index of 40 are more likely to be denied a transplant due to their weight.</p>



<p>"Since MASLD is a leading cause of liver failure, it only makes sense to protect the precious, lifegiving new liver from the same damage that led to the patient needing a transplant in the first place. Safely combining the two procedures protects the transplanted liver and can provide profound health benefits to these patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kellogg-todd-a-m-d/bio-20055725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Kellogg, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic bariatric surgeon and the study's co-author.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about using new prescription medications for weight loss?</h2>



<p>New weight loss medications, such as GLP-1s, are being used to help some pre-transplant and post-transplant patients manage their weight. Still, Mayo Clinic experts say bariatric surgery remains an important option for patients with severe obesity due to its safety, proven effectiveness and lasting results. Another <a href="https://journals.lww.com/kidney360/citation/9900/medical_therapy_versus_bariatric_surgery_in_kidney.643.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Mayo study</a> related to kidney transplant patients supports this.</p>



<p>"The patients that we're talking about really have a significant amount of extra weight. The issue with the GLP-1 medications is they are effective in terms of weight loss as well as other benefits which are being identified, but they may not get these patients with severe obesity to their lasting goal of a healthier weight," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>

<p>Bringing together experts from different medical specialties is essential when treating these patients, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ty Diwan, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and the study's co-author.</p>



<p>"This study shows that caring for these complex patients extends beyond the transplant itself," Dr. Diwan says. "Multidisciplinary care is required to maximize patient outcomes, and that is what we see in this data.&nbsp;By bringing together experts in very different fields, we've improved patient care and overall health outcomes."</p>

<p>"Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease is the most common liver disease, not only in the United States but worldwide," says Dr. Heimbach.</p>



<p>As obesity rates rise, so does the need to treat patients with MASLD.</p>



<p>"When we have excess fat that builds up in the liver, this can lead to inflammation and scarring and even advanced liver disease," she says.</p>



<p>It won't cause complications for everyone, but, for some, it can progress to cirrhosis.</p>



<p>"When a patient develops&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487%20?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cirrhosis,</a>&nbsp;they can then need a liver transplant," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>



<p>And having extra weight can be a reason patients might not be eligible for transplant. At Mayo Clinic, the approach is to help patients with obesity as well as transplant.</p>

<p>"We consider both liver transplant and what's called a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleeve-gastrectomy/about/pac-20385183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleeve gastrectomy,</a> which is a type of weight-loss operation that can be used as a tool to help patients be successful in managing not only their liver disease with a liver transplant, but their obesity with the sleeve gastrectomy," Dr. Heimbach explains.</p>



<p>The procedures are done simultaneously with multiple teams working together. Dr. Heimbach says it's about providing patients the care they need.</p>



<p>"I'm excited about what transplant offers to all of our patients, which is to be able to return to the life that they had before they got sick. And for patients who were carrying extra weight, not only are they healthy again, but now they're able to really fully enjoy and be fully participating in their life," she says.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Every year, some mothers die after giving birth due to heart problems, and many of these deaths could be prevented. The ability to screen for heart weakness before pregnancy could play a crucial role in identifying women who may need additional care to improve pregnancy outcomes. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers, led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kinaszczuk-anja-m-d-o/bio-20490717" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anja Kinaszczuk, D.O.</a>, and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/adedinsewo-demilade-a-m-b-ch-b/bio-20507418" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Demilade Adedinsewo, M.D.</a>, tested artificial intelligence (AI) tools, using recordings from an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/about/pac-20384983" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrocardiogram (ECG)</a> and a digital stethoscope, to find unknown heart problems in women of childbearing age seen in primary care.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.230627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Study findings</a> published in the Annals of Family Medicine show high diagnostic performance of these technologies to detect <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ekg/expert-answers/ejection-fraction/faq-20058286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">left ventricular ejection fraction</a> below 50%, indicating heart muscle weakness. These tools were tested on two groups of women aged 18 to 49.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Group 1: 100 women already scheduled for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a> (the best test to evaluate heart muscle function). They also had a standard clinical ECG and digital stethoscope recording of the heart’s electrical activity and heart sounds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Group 2: 100 women seen for routine primary care visits to see how often the AI tools would find heart problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>The AI-ECG demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of .94 while the AI digital stethoscope, Eko DUO, achieved an even higher AUC of 0.98, indicating strong diagnostic accuracy. In the second cohort, the prevalence of positive AI screening results was 1% for the AI-ECG and 3.2% for the AI-stethoscope.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Statistically, nearly half of pregnancies in this country are unplanned, and approximately 1% to 2% of women may have heart problems they don't know about. Our research findings suggest that these AI tools could be used to screen women before pregnancy, allowing for improved pregnancy planning and risk stratification, early treatment, and better health outcomes which addresses a critical gap in current maternal care," says Dr. Adedinsewo, a cardiologist and senior author of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>This research builds upon earlier published studies, including a <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38989045/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pilot prospective study</a> evaluating AI digital tools to detect pregnancy-related cardiomyopathy among obstetric patients in the U.S. and a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03243-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pragmatic randomized clinical trial</a> of women in Nigeria who were pregnant or had recently given birth. Collectively, this research highlights the potential of AI to modernize cardiovascular screening, enabling earlier identification and management of heart muscle weakness in women of reproductive age. Further research is underway to explore the potential of using these technologies to screen for heart weakness in broader populations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has licensed the underlying technology to EKO Health for its digital stethoscope with embedded ECG electrodes and to Anumana for the 12-lead ECG. Mayo Clinic and some study authors have a financial interest in this technology. Mayo Clinic will use any revenue it receives to support its not-for-profit mission in patient care, education and research.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have identified a potential new way to monitor the progression of high-grade gliomas, one of the most aggressive types of brain cancer. Their feasibility study suggests that a personalized blood test tailored to each patient's tumor DNA could provide a faster and less invasive way to determine if the cancer is advancing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, clinicians rely on scans and surgical biopsies to monitor gliomas, but both methods have limitations. For example, scans often cannot distinguish tumor growth from treatment effects such as inflammation. Biopsies require invasive procedures, making them impractical for routine monitoring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This new approach, published in <a href="https://aacrjournals.org/clincancerres/article/doi/10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-24-3233/754481/Personalized-Tumor-Specific-Amplified-DNA?searchresult=1">Clinical Cancer Research</a>, may provide clinicians with another tool to monitor tumor changes over time and adjust treatment as needed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracking DNA fragments of gliomas</strong></h2>



<p>The findings focus on tumor DNA fragments circulating in the blood. As gliomas grow, some glioma cells die, shedding pieces of their DNA into the bloodstream and leaving behind genetic markers that are unique to the tumor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, gliomas release fewer DNA fragments into the blood compared to many other cancers. This is because of the blood-brain barrier, a natural brain defense that prevents many substances from leaving the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To overcome this limitation, researchers focused on DNA junctions, a type of tumor-specific DNA fragment that is present in higher quantities. By targeting these markers, researchers achieved greater sensitivity, enabling them to detect even the smallest signs of tumor progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike normal DNA, which follows a structured sequence, these DNA junctions form when the tumor's genetic material breaks and rearranges. The study found that these amplified DNA junctions, due to their higher numbers, may provide a clearer picture of disease progression.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This research builds on years of studying genetic rearrangements and gives us a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving gliomas," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/vasmatzis-george-ph-d/bio-00027811">George Vasmatzis, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author of the study and co-director of the Biomarker Discovery Program at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine and Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. "It offers new possibilities for patient-specific monitoring and targeted interventions."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Detecting tumor DNA</strong></h2>



<p>In the study, researchers analyzed samples from patients with high-grade gliomas. They used whole genome sequencing to map each tumor's unique genetic blueprint and pinpointed patient-specific DNA junctions. Researchers then developed personalized blood tests to search for these genetic markers in plasma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The test detected tumor DNA in approximately 93% of the cases where these DNA junctions were present. In some patients, tumor DNA levels in the blood rose before MRI scans showed any changes — offering a potential early signal for disease progression.</p>

<p>"By tracking each tumor's distinct molecular signature, we're aiming to shift from a reactive approach to one that's far more proactive," says Dr. Burns, a co-author of the study. "This research could lay the groundwork for tools that help clinicians make the most informed treatment decisions as early as possible."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future studies will evaluate how well blood-based tumor tracking correlates with glioma progression across a larger group of patients.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Researchers at <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a> have made a groundbreaking discovery: a rare genetic variant that can directly cause metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. It is one of the most common diseases in the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until now, scientists believed the disease resulted from a combination of genetic and environmental factors. This study, <a href="https://journals.lww.com/hep/abstract/9900/discovery_of_a_met_driven_monogenic_cause_of.1151.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Hepatology</a>, reveals that in some cases, a single inherited variant can be the primary driver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers identified this variant in the MET<em> </em>gene, which regulates liver repair and fat metabolism. When the gene malfunctions, fat accumulates in liver cells and triggers inflammation. Over time, this leads to fibrosis and scarring, which stiffens the liver. In severe cases, the disease progresses to cirrhosis, resulting in irreversible liver damage or liver cancer.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)"><blockquote><p>"This discovery opens a window into how rare inherited genetic variants can drive common diseases."</p><cite>Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D, Ph.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease affects about one-third of adults worldwide. Its advanced form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, is expected to become the leading cause of cirrhosis and the reason for liver transplants in the coming years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This discovery opens a window into how rare inherited genetic variants can drive common diseases," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pinto-e-vairo-filippo-m-d-ph-d/bio-20503559" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D, Ph.D.</a>, a lead author and medical director of the Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases at Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine. "It provides new insights into this disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic targets for future research."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A hidden error in the genetic code</strong>&nbsp;</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-402212" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-1024x576.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-300x169.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-768x432.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation-1536x864.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/16x9-gene-mutation.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>The discovery emerged from the genomic data of a woman and her father with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. They had no history of diabetes or high cholesterol, two common risk factors for fat buildup in the liver.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With no clear explanation, researchers examined the DNA from more than 20,000 genes to find answers. They found a small but potentially significant error in the MET gene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In collaboration with the Medical College of Wisconsin's John &amp; Linda Mellowes Center for Genomic Sciences and Precision Medicine, led by <a href="https://www.mcw.edu/departments/surgery/people/raul-a-urrutia-md-academic-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raul Urrutia, M.D.</a>, the scientists determined that the mutation disrupted a critical biological process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Genes are made up of chemical letters that provide instructions for the body's functions. In this case, a single swapped letter — among thousands — scrambled the message, preventing the liver from properly processing fat. This rare variant, found in the family, has not been reported in existing literature or public databases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"This study demonstrates that rare diseases are not rare but often hidden in the large pool of complex disorders, underscoring the immense power of individualized medicine in identifying them, and enabling the design of advanced diagnostics and targeted therapies," Dr. Urrutia says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracing the genetic variant impact</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-393916" style="width:427px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-1024x576.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-300x169.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-768x432.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry-1536x864.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/09/16x9-Tapestry.png 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>


<p>To explore the variant's broader impact, researchers turned to Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinics-largest-ever-exome-study-offers-blueprint-for-biomedical-breakthroughs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tapestry study</a>, a large-scale exome sequencing effort aimed at uncovering genomic drivers of disease. The Tapestry study analyzed germline DNA from over 100,000 participants across the U.S., creating a comprehensive genomic data repository that supports research into both well-known and emerging health conditions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among nearly 4,000 adult Tapestry participants with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, about 1% carried rare, potentially causative variants in the same MET gene. Of these, nearly 18% had variants in the same critical region as the initial woman and her father, further supporting its role in liver disease.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)"><blockquote><p>"This finding highlights the profound value of studying familial diseases and the merit of large-scale genomic datasets, which can reveal rare genetic variations with broader implications for population health."</p><cite>Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.d.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"This finding could potentially affect hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people worldwide with or at risk for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine/about/director-insights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</a>, a lead author and the Carlson and Nelson Endowed Executive Director for the Center for Individualized Medicine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Lazaridis emphasized the significance of this discovery as it relates to the Tapestry study's impactful contributions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Once a pathogenic variant is discovered, interrogating our Tapestry data repository is giving us a clearer lens into the hidden layers of disease, and this discovery is one of the first to demonstrate its scientific significance," Dr. Lazaridis says. "This finding highlights the profound value of studying familial diseases and the merit of large-scale genomic datasets, which can reveal rare genetic variations with broader implications for population health."&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Advancing genomics to transform care</strong></h2>

<p>This discovery also reflects the importance of integrating genomics into clinical care at Mayo Clinic, where teams use advanced technologies to help solve complex medical mysteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since its launch in 2019, the Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases has helped more than 3,200 patients with complex and serious conditions gain access to comprehensive genomic testing. It collaborates with nearly 300 clinicians from 14 divisions across the enterprise to bring precision diagnostics to patients with rare conditions, including rare liver diseases.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Future studies will explore how this genomic discovery in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease can inform targeted treatments and improve disease management.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-262761e01ff77cb5f88a9182f1ce45b6" style="color:#565050"></p>



<p>A new Mayo Clinic study finds that people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tourette-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20350465" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tourette syndrome</a> have about half as many of a specific type of brain cell that helps calm overactive movement signals as people without the condition. This deficit may be a key reason why their motor signals go unchecked, leading to the involuntary tics that define the disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(25)00064-2/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Published in Biological Psychiatry,</a> the study is the first to analyze individual brain cells from people with Tourette disorder. The findings also shed light on how different types of brain cells may interact in ways that contribute to the syndrome's symptoms.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)"><blockquote><p>"If we can understand how these brain cells are altered and how they interact, we may be able to intervene earlier and more precisely."&nbsp;</p><cite>Alexej Abyzov, Ph.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>"This research may help lay the foundation for a new generation of treatments," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/abyzov-alexej-ph-d/bio-20089449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexej Abyzov, Ph.D.</a>, a genomic scientist in <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a> and a co-author of the study. "If we can understand how these brain cells are altered and how they interact, we may be able to intervene earlier and more precisely."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Tourette disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that typically begins in childhood. It causes repeated, involuntary movements and vocalizations such as eye blinking, throat clearing or facial grimacing. Nearly 1 in 162 children in the U.S. have Tourette syndrome, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tourette-syndrome/data/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Centers for Disease Control</a>. While genetic studies have identified some risk genes, the biological mechanisms behind the condition have remained unclear.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A close look at key brain cells</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="683" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/basal-ganglia-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402040" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/basal-ganglia-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/basal-ganglia-300x200.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/basal-ganglia-768x512.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/basal-ganglia-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/basal-ganglia-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This illustration shows the basal ganglia, the brain region involved in movement and the focus of Mayo Clinic's Tourette syndrome study. Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>To better understand what's happening in the brain with Tourette syndrome, Dr. Abyzov and his team analyzed more than 43,000 individual cells from postmortem brain tissue of&nbsp;people with and without the condition. </p>



<p>They focused on the basal ganglia, a region of the brain that helps control movement and behavior. In each cell, they looked at how genes were working. They also analyzed how changes in the brain's gene-control systems might trigger stress and inflammation.</p>



<p>First, they found in people with Tourette syndrome a 50% reduction in interneurons. These brain cells help calm excess signals in the brain's movement circuits.</p>



<p>They also observed stress responses in two other brain cell types. Medium spiny neurons make up most of the cells in basal ganglia. They help send movement signals and showed reduced energy production. Microglia, the brain's immune cells, showed inflammation. The researchers found a close link between the two responses, suggesting the cells may interact in Tourette disorder.</p>

<p>"We're seeing different types of brain cells reacting to stress and possibly communicating with each other in ways that could be driving symptoms," says Yifan Wang, Ph.D., co-author of the study. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The study points to changes in DNA regions that control when genes turn on and off as a possible cause of brain cell changes in Tourette disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Tourette patients seem to have the same functional genes as everyone else but the coordination between them is broken," says Dr. Abyzov.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the researchers plan to study how these brain changes develop over time and look for genetic factors that may help explain the disorder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers conducted the study in collaboration with the lab of Flora M. Vaccarino, M.D., at Yale University.

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A study published in <a href="https://academic.oup.com/braincomms/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/braincomms/fcaf106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brain Communications</a> highlights a new approach to treating drug-resistant epilepsy. Researchers at Mayo Clinic have developed an innovative <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep brain stimulation</a> (DBS) platform that was used to not only reduce seizures, but also improve memory and sleep — two common challenges for patients with epilepsy.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Epilepsy</a>, a seizure disorder that affects about 50 million people worldwide, often disrupts memory, emotions and sleep. Many cases are drug-resistant, leaving people with limited treatment options. Researchers at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> found that low-frequency DBS not only reduced seizures, but it also improved memory and sleep.</p>



<p>"Using an implanted investigational device, the team continuously monitored brain activity with AI-driven seizure and sleep tracking," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/worrell-gregory-a-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gregory Worrell, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic neurologist and co-lead author of the study. "A cloud-based platform simultaneously assessed participants' behavior, memory and mood at home. This real-time data enables precise tuning of stimulation settings, maximizing benefits while minimizing side effects."</p>



<p>"By using an implanted device that continuously monitors brain activity, we can detect seizures more accurately than patient-reported diaries in order to optimize deep brain stimulation in real-time and improve treatment," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kremen-vaclav-ph-d-m-s/bio-20473935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vaclav Kremen, Ph.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic researcher and co-lead author of the study.</p>



<p>The researchers monitored five patients with temporal lobe epilepsy throughout their DBS treatment. The system allowed patients to track their brain activity and symptoms remotely, providing doctors with detailed, real-world data to fine-tune treatments. This technology could lead to more effective treatments for drug-resistant epilepsy and could be expanded to treat other neurological and psychiatric disorders.</p>



<p>"Our study demonstrates the potential of emerging neurotechnology to treat human disease," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/van-gompel-jamie-j-m-d/bio-20249290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jamie Van Gompel, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic neurosurgeon and co-author of the study.</p>



<p>"Combining neuroscience, engineering and artificial intelligence, our work is paving the way for more personalized and effective treatments for epilepsy and other brain disorders," says Dr. Worrell.</p>



<p>The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health — National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and the CLARA project, which has received funding from the European Union's Horizon Europe research and innovation program.&nbsp; The implanted devices were donated by Medtronic as part of the National Institutes of Health Brain Initiative Public-Private Partnership.</p>

<p>When Vicki Tennant came to Mayo Clinic for answers about her heart condition, she never expected to be at the center of a medical breakthrough. But her case led Mayo Clinic researchers to identify a previously undetectable genetic phenomenon.</p>



<p>Most genetic diseases are linked to protein-coding regions, which is also where standard testing has been focused. The discovery based on Tennant's case, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCHEARTFAILURE.124.012632" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in Circulation: Heart Failure</a>, was that disease-causing variants can hide in areas of DNA that don't make proteins. </p>



<p>Specifically, a tiny glitch in one of these regions, combined with a known mutation, was enough to cause Tennant's disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"The level of care and expertise at Mayo Clinic is something I've never experienced," Tennant says. "It’s amazing to think that what they found in me could change how doctors diagnose others."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A clue hidden in the heart</strong></h2>



<p>In her home state of Iowa, Tennant had been diagnosed with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a genetic condition that thickens the heart muscle and increases the risk of heart failure. But her case didn't follow the usual pattern.</p>



<p>She had an irregular heartbeat that required several procedures to restore a normal rhythm, and she had also had a stroke. Her cardiologist in Iowa referred her to Mayo Clinic for further evaluation.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, what began as a closer look at Tennant’s heart tissue by cardiologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/geske-jeffrey-b-m-d/bio-00092430">Jeffrey Geske, M.D.</a>, quickly gained momentum. Pathologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/maleszewski-joseph-j-m-d/bio-20095734">Joseph Maleszewski, M.D.</a>, examined the biopsy and identified microscopic abnormalities that indicated the need for further investigation.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Tennant underwent a routine gallbladder surgery in Iowa. A liver biopsy performed during that procedure also revealed abnormalities, prompting Tennant to ask her Mayo team to review the findings. That request helped deepen the investigation into the underlying cause of her health issues.</p>



<p>When standard clinical genetic testing did not yield an answer, Dr. Geske asked <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pereira-naveen-l-m-d/bio-20178506">Naveen Pereira, M.D.</a>, a cardiovascular genomicist, to take a closer look at Tennant's DNA. Dr. Pereira searched Tennant's genome for hidden patterns and anomalies.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--40)"><blockquote><p>"This discovery highlights the strength of integrating advanced genomic science with clinical expertise to solve some of medicine's most complex mysteries."</p><cite>Naveen Pereira, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>He found that Tennant had one known disease-causing mutation in a gene responsible for producing an enzyme that prevents substances from accumulating in the cell. Normally, two mutations are needed to cause a genetic condition called mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA. But something still didn't add up — besides having only one variant, Tennant lacked some of the typical symptoms of the disease.</p>



<p>Dr. Pereira conducted additional lab tests to check for signs of the condition in her cells, however, which led to confirming it as her diagnosis.</p>



<p>Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA usually appears in early childhood and causes progressive neurological decline. But Tennant, in her 40s, had no signs of neurological issues. In her, the condition showed up as heart disease — an unexpected and atypical presentation that added to the mystery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A genetic mystery unfolds</strong></h2>



<p>With unanswered questions remaining, Dr. Pereira expanded the team, bringing in experts from <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-individualized-medicine">Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine</a>: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/pinto-e-vairo-filippo-m-d-ph-d/bio-20503559">Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic’s Program for Rare and Undiagnosed Diseases; <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, the Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director of Research and Innovation; and <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lambert-laura-j-ph-d/bio-20545313">Laura Lambert, Ph.D.</a>, director of the Functional Omics Resource Laboratory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="906" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-1024x906.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-401914" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-1024x906.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-300x265.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert-768x679.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/research_team_collage_updated_lambert.jpg 1038w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><em>Some of the Mayo Clinic experts who helped uncover the hidden genetic cause behind a rare heart condition. Top row, from left: Jeffrey Geske, M.D; Naveen Pereira, M.D.; Laura Lambert, Ph.D.; Bottom row, from left: Filippo Pinto e Vairo, M.D., Ph.D.; Eric Klee, Ph.D.</em>; Joseph Maleszewski, M.D.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The team applied advanced sequencing and analysis methods to search beyond the usual areas of the genome. That's when they made another discovery.</p>



<p>"We found a variant in a stretch of DNA located between two genes — it's a region often missed by standard genetic testing because it doesn't code for proteins," says Dr. Pinto e Vairo. "Now we had to prove it was actually disrupting how the gene worked and contributing to the disease in our patient."</p>



<p>To validate the finding, Dr. Lambert and the Functional Omics Resource Laboratory team used innovative, light-based methods to test whether the DNA change was interfering with how the gene worked.</p>



<p>"This gave us the functional proof we needed to confirm that this variant was actually causing disease," Dr. Lambert says.</p>



<p>Combined with the known mutation previously identified by Dr. Pereira, this hidden change provided the missing explanation for Tennant's condition.</p>



<p>"This finding is a testament to the transformative potential of looking beyond the expected," Dr. Klee says. "It underscores how advancements in genomics and technology are enhancing our ability to understand the impact of an increasing number of genetic changes."</p>



<p>Together, these insights revealed an entirely new way genetic disease can emerge and take shape.</p>



<p>"This discovery highlights the strength of integrating advanced genomic science with clinical expertise to solve some of medicine's most complex mysteries," says Dr. Pereira. "This finding could help change our approach and diagnose other patients with unexplained conditions, and expand the scope of precision medicine."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A long-awaited answer</strong></h2>



<p>For Tennant, the discovery has provided long-sought clarity. She enjoys working on her farm, spending time outdoors and operating her tractor — all activities she now approaches with a deeper understanding of her health.</p>



<p>While there is no cure for Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA with cardiac involvement, her diagnosis allows for more precise monitoring and offers hope for potential future treatments, including gene therapy.</p>



<p>"I also hope this helps someone else," Tennant says. "If sharing my story means someone gets diagnosed sooner, then it's all worth it."</p>

<p>"I started having the seizures, noticeable seizures, and from there, it just started getting worse and worse," recalls Anthony.</p>



<p>It began after Anthony graduated from high school. He was making plans for his future and looking forward to attending college. That's when the seizures began.</p>



<p>Initially, the seizures were mild but quickly became more severe. "The experience (seizure) is like a loss of time, like a blank spot in your memory — like you're waking up without any recollection of what happened," says Anthony.</p>



<p>"The seizures were several times a week. His lips would be blue. His mouth would be blue," says Patricia Maita, Anthony's mother. "It so hard to see your child go through that and feel so helpless."</p>



<p>Doctors tried to manage Anthony's seizures with medication, but nothing worked. Eventually Anthony was diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy, or DRE.</p>



<p>In search of hope, Anthony's family turned to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona">Mayo </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinic</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona"> Arizona</a>.</p>

<p>"These patients have tried at least two medications, and they're still having seizures. At that point, we know the chances of seizure freedom unfortunately become very low, and that's when we start looking at other options," says Dr. Parker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A battle for millions worldwide</strong></h2>



<p>Anthony is one of approximately 50 million people worldwide diagnosed with epilepsy.

<p>Of those diagnosed with epilepsy, approximately 30%, or 15 million people, are considered medication-resistant. Uncontrolled seizures often rob many people of their ability to live and function independently.</p>



<p>While it is rare, seizures can lead to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, or SUDEP. "We know that more frequent seizures mean the patient is at higher risk of SUDEP, so that's why we are very aggressive about treating epilepsy with all the tools we have available," says Dr. Parker.</p>



<p>Current treatment options for patients with DRE include surgical procedures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain resection</a>&nbsp;to remove a portion of the brain tissue responsible for generating seizures. A less invasive procedure involves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser ablation</a>&nbsp;therapy that pinpoints and destroys abnormal brain tissue. While often effective, these surgical approaches carry the risk of possible side effects, such as memory impairment, motor deficits and speech difficulties.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unlocking new hope for patients</strong></h2>



<p>Now, a growing number of scientists across the globe are part of an innovative trend in research, investigating novel ways to treat DRE. It involves the use of&nbsp;<ins><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a></ins>&nbsp;as a "reparative" approach to help the brain heal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Parker is the lead investigator of the first-in-human clinical trial at Mayo Clinic which studies the use of implanted specialized inhibitory brain cells as a potential reparative treatment for DRE.&nbsp;Dr. Parker's clinical trial is underway in Arizona.</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic in Arizona&nbsp;is one of 29 sites nationwide participating in the inhibitory brain cell implant clinical trial for patients with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focal epilepsy</a>, where seizures originate in a specific region of the brain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anthony became Mayo Clinic's first patient to undergo the investigational brain cell implant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We use a very minimally invasive technique where we inject the inhibitory cells through a pencil eraser-sized incision in the back of the head. Our hope is that, over time, these cells become part of the brain and help repair the neural circuitry, and reduce or prevent seizures without the side effects," says Dr. Parker. The cells are implanted in a one-time, single-dose procedure.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"Honestly, it was pretty easy," says Anthony. "I had no trouble with it." Anthony was discharged from the hospital the next day.</p>



<p>Doctors say it is still too early to determine whether the brain cell implant was effective, but they are hopeful. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tabitha's life-long struggle to control seizures</strong></h2>



<p>Tabitha Wilson lives in fear, never knowing when or where the next seizure will strike.</p>



<p>The Florida resident was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 2. She was placed on medication that adequately managed her seizures — until the week before her high school graduation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep brain stimulation</a> is one of the most recent FDA-approved methods of neuromodulation therapy for epilepsy.&nbsp;Studies show that patients who undergo deep brain stimulation experience median seizure reduction up to 70% after five years. However, Dr. Grewal says it is uncommon for patients to become seizure-free.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Unfortunately, neuromodulation doesn't give us the seizure freedom we want, and that's why we are trying to combine deep brain stimulation with stem cell therapy to see if we can increase the efficacy of neuromodulation," he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clinical trial involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells, a type of adult stem cell that has anti-inflammatory properties. MSCs may also support tissue repair and healing. Further scientific research is needed to confirm their therapeutic potential in the field of regenerative medicine.</p>

Our hope is that by adding stem cells and their regenerative potential, we can increase treatment success."</strong></p><cite>Dr. Sanjeet Grewal, Neurosurgeon and Clinical trial lead investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The MSCs used in the clinical trial are derived from fat tissue and created at&nbsp;the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Cell Therapy Laboratory</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida under the leadership of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abba Zubair, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a pioneer in cell therapy.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's research teams have developed a cost-effective method of producing MSCs for use in potential treatments for conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/groundbreaking-studies-of-regenerative-medicine-treatment-for-intracerebral-hemorrhage/mac-20552299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/space-a-new-frontier-for-exploring-stem-cell-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Zubair has also led innovative research, including sending stem cells to the International Space Station to investigate how microgravity impacts their growth. </a></p>

<p>Dr. Zubair has several research projects scheduled to launch into space in 2025.</p>



<p>"MSCs are what we call multipotent, meaning they can differentiate into different cell types based on where they're placed. If they are placed near blood vessels, they can become blood vessel types. If they're placed by heart cells, they can become heart cell types," explains Dr. Grewal. </p>



<p>The hope is the MSCs eventually become neural or brain cell types and interact in the part of the brain where the seizures occur. "It's called paracrine signaling, where they're releasing signals to the brain tissue around them and interacting in a way to try to repair that tissue."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"I'm willing to try everything and anything to get some sort of control over these seizures because I've been living with this for so long."</strong></p><cite>Tabitha Wilson, Clinical Trial participant</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Since undergoing the procedure, there has been an improvement in Tabitha's seizure management. However, Dr. Grewal says it is too early to know whether this is due to the deep brain stimulation, stem cells or both.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Drs. Grewal and Parker say there is still a long road ahead to determine whether these cell therapies are proven safe and effective for patients with DRE. But they agree each day brings them one step closer to a potential treatment or cure for patients like Tabitha and Anthony.</p>



<p>"We've thought about this for generations, we just didn't have these technologies to enable it. Now we do," says Dr. Grewal. "So, whether it's wound healing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/deep-learning-fuels-neurodegenerative-disease-research/mac-20545173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurodegeneration</a>, epilepsy or&nbsp;stroke, there are so many different studies going on investigating the potential of regenerative or reparative therapies."</p>
