<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have identified a specific immune cell that can be targeted to give a boost to standard immunotherapies for cancer. Two research teams, working collaboratively but using distinct approaches, found that "first-responder" immune cells known as myeloid cells can be manipulated to enhance the activity of tumor-killing T cells.</p>



<p>The finding suggests that enhanced myeloid cells may boost certain immune checkpoint therapies, which are the standard of care for some cancers but may not have lasting effects. A clinical trial is now being developed at Mayo Clinic to test the enhanced cells in patients.</p>



<p></p>



<p>In a study in <a href="https://jitc.bmj.com/content/13/10/e012164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers detailed how they found a way to boost cancer-killing T cells. The goal was to improve treatments that interfere with immunosuppressive proteins, PD-1 and PD-L1, which together suppress T cells' ability to fight cancer. Even though PD-L1 immunotherapies aim to block PD-L1, the researchers found that the molecule can persist through a natural recycling process that puts it back in play.</p>

<p>"Our study found the importance of the recycling process, and we present a way to address it," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dong-haidong-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Haidong Dong, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a cancer immunology researcher at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center/cancer-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and principal investigator of the study.</p>



<p>The research team developed an antibody, H1A, which they found can reduce PD-L1 in human myeloid cells and keep it from recycling. The protein PD-L1 is present in abundance on the surface of myeloid cells. When the protein was prevented from recycling on myeloid cells, the cells then boosted the action of cancer-killing T cells.</p>

<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Hsu-Michelle-A._30026716_202509162045-240x300.jpg" alt="Portrait of Michelle Hsu" class="wp-image-407367" style="width:200px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Hsu-Michelle-A._30026716_202509162045-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Hsu-Michelle-A._30026716_202509162045.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Michelle Hsu</figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"We now have a tool that can completely remove PD-L1 and in doing so we have more myeloid cell activation," says lead author of the study, Michelle Hsu, who conducted the research as her graduate thesis at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>. "Identifying the myeloid cell was an unexpected discovery," she says. </p>

<p>Another Mayo Clinic team took a different approach and arrived at a similar conclusion about the importance of myeloid cells. A research team led by immunology researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lancaster-jessica-n-ph-d/bio-20482482" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jessica Lancaster, Ph.D.</a>, at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a>, reported in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589004225017997" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iScience</a> that macrophages, a type of myeloid cell, play a role in activating the cancer-killing T cells.</p>

Black spaces are packed with non-fluorescent tumor cells. Image captured by Tina Kwok, Mayo Clinic.</em><br></p>



<p>Using the complex approach of live-cell microscopy, the team found that in mice, T cells interact closely with the macrophages and create a molecular environment that has greater capacity to kill a tumor.</p>



<p>"This is a paradigm shift for PD-L1 immunotherapy, which has traditionally focused on the interaction of the tumor and the T cells," says Dr. Lancaster. "We found that it’s important to co-opt the macrophage, which acts as another immune cell partner."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="240" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Kwok-Tina_30026717_202506271753-240x300.jpg" alt="Portrait of Tina Kwok" class="wp-image-407366" style="width:179px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Kwok-Tina_30026717_202506271753-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/10/Kwok-Tina_30026717_202506271753.jpg 640w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Tina Kwok</figcaption></figure></div>


<p><br>Further, says lead author Tina Kwok, who completed the studies during her Ph.D. research at Mayo Clinic, "We can directly reprogram tumor macrophages to be more pro-inflammatory. They can become better T-cell activators and drive better tumor control. Reprogramming of the macrophage may be key to being able to prevent therapy resistance and change outcomes for patients."</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Based on the findings from both labs, a phase 1 clinical trial of H1A is being planned. The research could ultimately better address resistance to immunotherapy and expand treatment options for people with cancer.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mayoclinicproceedings.org%2Fpb-assets%2FHealth%2520Advance%2Fjournals%2Fjmcp%2FJMCP4762.pdf&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CFurst.Justin%40mayo.edu%7C96006f986b5a48bf500c08de08248578%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638957150871831386%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=zaP8jQgwJ12UEaFVekeNDuQSVbmxuVVLvIwDBREoZPw%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study</a> from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> underscores the widespread impact of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a> symptoms on midlife women — and raises concern that most are navigating this stage of life without medical care to help manage those challenges.</p>



<p>The study, published in <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Proceedings</a>, was based on responses from nearly 5,000 women ages 45-60 who were surveyed across four Mayo Clinic primary care locations. More than 3 out of 4 respondents experienced menopause symptoms, with many reporting substantial effects on daily life, work productivity and overall well-being.</p>



<p>Despite the availability of safe and effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment options</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers found that menopause symptoms remain underrecognized, undertreated and inadequately addressed in the health care system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Severe symptoms affect daily life, yet few women seek care or receive treatment</strong></h2>



<p>More than one-third (34%) of women who were surveyed reported moderate to very severe symptoms. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-managing-sleep-during-menopause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sleep</a> disturbances and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-combating-weight-gain-during-menopause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight gain</a> were among the most common issues reported by more than half of participants.</p>



<p>The most striking finding was that more than 80% of the women who responded to the survey did not seek medical care for their menopause symptoms. While many women said they preferred to manage symptoms on their own, others said that they were too busy or unaware that effective treatments exist. Only about 1 in 4 women were receiving any treatment for menopause symptoms at the time of the survey.</p>



<p>"Menopause is universal for women at midlife, the symptoms are common and disruptive, and yet, few women are receiving care that could help them," says lead author <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapoor-ekta-m-b-b-s/bio-20090811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ekta Kapoor, M.B.B.S.</a>, an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/endocrinology/sections/overview/ovc-20392506" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endocrinologist</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/menopause-womens-sexual-health/overview/ovc-20487915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause specialist</a> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. "This gap has real consequences for women's health and quality of life, and it's time we address it more proactively."</p>



<p>Without proper treatment, menopause symptoms can negatively affect sleep, mood, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-does-menopause-cause-brain-fog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognition</a>, and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-study-puts-price-tag-on-cost-of-menopause-symptoms-for-women-in-the-workplace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">productivity</a> at work and at home. The findings underscore the importance of healthcare professionals proactively identifying and managing menopause symptoms in patients who may be struggling with them, the authors said.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Researchers call for proactive care strategies and new tools to close the treatment gap</strong></h2>



<p>The study noted that women often do not voluntarily mention concerns about menopause symptoms to their healthcare professional. Mayo Clinic researchers emphasize the need for strategies that destigmatize menopause care and make it more visible and accessible. Efforts are underway to develop questionnaires, digital tools and smartphone apps that help women identify symptoms, learn about treatment options and have more productive discussions with their primary care professionals.</p>



<p>"Our goal is to educate women and healthcare professionals about menopause," Dr. Kapoor says. "By making it easier to recognize and understand symptoms, we can close the gap between need and care — and help midlife women live healthier, more fulfilling lives."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have discovered a key reason why certain breast cancers might not respond to an important new class of therapeutics called antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). These treatments pair an antibody that targets cancer cells with a strong chemotherapy drug. For many patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/expert-answers/breast-cancer/faq-20058066" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HER2+</a>) breast cancers, ADCs such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/fam-trastuzumab-deruxtecan-nxki-intravenous-route/description/drg-20481655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd)</a> have dramatically improved outcomes.</p>



<p>"While T-DXd has shown remarkable results for many patients, it hasn't worked for everyone with advanced HER2+ breast cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lucas-peter-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20571057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peter Lucas, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, vice chair for research in the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology</a> at Mayo Clinic and co-senior author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43018-025-00969-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, published in Nature Cancer. "This indicates that some tumors have built-in resistant mechanisms that prevent the drug from doing its job."</p>



<p>In the study, researchers in the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/oncoimmune-signaling-therapeutics/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oncoimmune Signaling and Therapeutics Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic discovered that a shortened version of the HER2 protein, called p95HER2, that is produced by a subset of HER2+ breast cancers can alter treatment response. The protein p95HER2 "signals differently" from the full HER2 oncoprotein — which proved to be the key to how it drives therapy resistance.</p>



<p>"Our discovery that p95HER2 has the unique ability to induce signals that produce an immune-protected microenvironment strongly suggested that p95HER2 could function within cancer cells to actively resist T-DXd," says Dr. Lucas.</p>



<p>The study also revealed that a drug called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/neratinib-oral-route/description/drg-20406380" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neratinib</a> is highly effective at blocking the action of p95HER2, even causing the protein to be degraded.</p>



<p>"In fact, treatment with neratinib results in complete p95HER2 degradation, abolishing the protein from the cancer cells in our preclinical models," says Dong Hu, Ph.D., a research scientist in Laboratory Medicine and Pathology at Mayo Clinic and lead author of the manuscript.</p>



<p>Based on these findings, the research team believes the next step is a clinical trial to evaluate the combination of neratinib with T-DXd in patients with HER2+ early breast cancer. The goal is to determine if this combination therapy can improve the response in cancers that co-express p95HER2 along with full HER2.</p>



<p>They note that this is just one of many therapeutic combinations being considered.</p>



<p>"No single, one-size-fits-all approach to treatment will work for every patient with HER2+ breast cancer," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/mcallister-linda-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-20568725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linda McAllister, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a pediatric hematologist/oncologist at Mayo Clinic and co-senior author of the study.</p>



<p>However, with the discovery of p95HER2's role, a clear roadmap for future treatment is in sight.</p>



<p>"Having this new understanding of why T-DXd does not always work helps us to envision next steps toward customized therapies and more cures," says Dr. Lucas. "It's all about staying one step ahead of cancer."</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. —&amp;nbsp;When it comes to treating disease, one promising avenue is addressing the presence of senescent cells. These cells — also known as "zombie cells" — stop dividing but don't die off as cells typically do. They turn up in numerous diseases, including cancer and Alzheimer's disease, and in the process of aging. While potential treatments aim to remove or repair the cells, one hurdle has been finding a way to identify them among healthy cells in living tissue.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In the journal <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.70245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aging Cell</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers report finding a new technique to tag senescent cells. The team used molecules known as "aptamers" — small segments of synthetic DNA that fold into three-dimensional shapes. Aptamers have the ability to attach themselves to proteins on the surfaces of cells. In mouse cells, the team found several rare aptamers, identified from among more than 100 trillion random DNA sequences, that can latch onto specific cell surface proteins and flag senescent cells.</p>



<p>"This approach established the principle that aptamers are a technology that can be used to distinguish senescent cells from healthy ones," says biochemist and molecular biologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/maher-jim-iii-ph-d/bio-00027304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jim Maher, III, Ph.D.</a>, a principal investigator of the study. "Though this study is a first step, the results suggest the approach could eventually apply to human cells."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From a quirky idea to collaboration &amp;nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>The project began with the quirky idea of a Mayo Clinic graduate student who had a chance conversation with a classmate.</p>



<p>Keenan Pearson, Ph.D. — who recently received his degree from <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> — was working under the mentorship of Dr. Maher, studying how aptamers might address neurodegenerative diseases or brain cancer.</p>



<p>A few floors away, Sarah Jachim, Ph.D., — who was also then conducting her graduate research — was working in the lab of researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lebrasseur-nathan-k-ph-d-m-s/bio-00055041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nathan LeBrasseur, Ph.D.</a>, Director, Mayo Clinic Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging, who studies senescent cells and aging.</p>



<p>At a scientific event, the two happened to chat about their graduate thesis projects. Dr. Pearson thought aptamer technology might be able to identify senescent cells. "I thought the idea was a good one, but I didn't know about the process of preparing senescent cells to test them, and that was Sarah's expertise," says Dr. Pearson, who became lead author of the publication. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>They pitched the idea to their mentors and to researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/baker-darren-j-ph-d-m-s/bio-00027985" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Darren Baker, Ph.D.</a>, who investigates therapies to treat senescent cells. At first, Dr. Maher acknowledges, the students' idea seemed "crazy" but worth pursuing. The three mentors were excited about the plan. "We frankly loved that it was the students' idea and a real synergy of two research areas," says Dr. Maher.</p>



<p>The students obtained compelling results sooner than they expected and quickly recruited other student participants from the labs. Then-graduate students Brandon Wilbanks, Ph.D., Luis Prieto, Ph.D., and M.D.-Ph.D. student Caroline Doherty, each contributed additional approaches, including special microscopy techniques and more varied tissue samples. "It became encouraging to expend more effort," Dr. Jachim says, "because we could tell it was a project that was going to succeed."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Identifying attributes of senescent cells</strong></h2>



<p>&amp;nbsp;The study has provided new information about senescent cells beyond a way to tag them. "To date, there aren't universal markers that characterize senescent cells," says Dr. Maher. "Our study was set up to be open-ended about the target surface molecules on senescent cells. The beauty of this approach is that we let the aptamers choose the molecules to bind to."</p>



<p>The study found several aptamers latched onto a variant of a specific molecule on the surface of mouse cells, a protein called fibronectin. The role of this variant fibronectin in senescence is not yet understood. The finding means that aptamers may be a tool to further define unique characteristics of senescent cells.</p>



<p>Additional studies will be necessary to find aptamers that can identify senescent cells in humans. Aptamers with the ability to latch onto senescent cells could potentially deliver a therapy directly to those cells. Dr. Pearson notes aptamer technology is less expensive and more versatile than conventional antibodies, proteins that are typically used to differentiate cells from one another.</p>



<p>"This project demonstrated a novel concept," says Dr. Maher. "Future studies may extend the approach to applications related to senescent cells in human disease."</p>

<p>Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) causes inflammation and scarring of the bile ducts. This rare liver disease is often accompanied by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Together, these diseases increase the risk of colorectal cancer by more than sixfold compared to the general population.</p>



<p>Until recently, it&amp;nbsp;<a>wasn't</a>&amp;nbsp;clear whether that increased colorectal cancer risk extended to people with PSC alone, but Mayo Clinic researchers have helped answer this question. Their findings could help open the door to earlier colorectal cancer screening and better prevention for people with PSC.</p>

<p>"We wanted to answer something that was overlooked in the guidelines because these patients are a smaller group and have been understudied in research," says Dr.&nbsp;Saqr Alsakarneh, a fellow in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/sections/overview/ovc-20348241?customer_id=919-955-2329&amp;amp;mc_id=google&amp;amp;campaign=8927988164&amp;amp;geo=9199032&amp;amp;kw=mayo%20clinic%20gastroenterology&amp;amp;ad=458309235531&amp;amp;network=g&amp;amp;sitetarget=&amp;amp;adgroup=111165104350&amp;amp;extension=&amp;amp;target=kwd-367650091164&amp;amp;matchtype=e&amp;amp;device=c&amp;amp;account=9199552329&amp;amp;invsrc=arizona&amp;amp;placementsite=arizona&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gad_campaignid=8927988164&amp;amp;gbraid=0AAAAAD8Qu28LZ_ykDEhzwUdztX41xIe9R&amp;amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw58PGBhCkARIsADbDilxBHSas-T8H9QdFt0dNSntXtQI6tzhJ5Pej5p9tpWeYJda5z2MOamwaAuh3EALw_wcB">Department of Gastroenterology at Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;and lead author of the study,&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/apt.70303">Alimentary Pharmacology and Therapeutics</a>. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Searching data for cancer prevention blind spots</strong></h2>



<p>In the largest population-based analysis of its kind, Dr. Alsakarneh and his co-authors analyzed data from 115 million de-identified health records from 65 healthcare organizations across the U.S. Their goal was to understand long-term risk of colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers in people with PSC.</p>



<p>The researchers found that&amp;nbsp;people with PSC without IBD have&amp;nbsp;<a>nearly three</a>&amp;nbsp;times the risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to the general population.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"This is important because it challenges the current assumption that only&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a>&amp;nbsp;with IBD causes colorectal cancer," says&amp;nbsp;Dr.&amp;nbsp;<a>Alsakarneh</a>.</p>



<p>While colorectal cancer prevention guidelines recommend annual screening and increased surveillance for people who have PSC and IBD, no specific guidelines exist for people with only PSC. Dr. Alsakarneh says this is a missed opportunity for early detection of colorectal cancer, which is highly preventable with proper screening.</p>



<p>In addition to discovering an increased risk for colorectal cancer, the study&amp;nbsp;confirmed an association between PSC alone and higher rates of bile duct,&amp;nbsp;<a>liver</a>&amp;nbsp;and pancreatic cancers. While previous research has suggested this connection, the study provides large-scale data to support the need for continued vigilance and screening strategies tailored to people with PSC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Translating discovery to better care</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Alsakarneh says these findings are an important first step toward a better understanding of PSC and cancer risk, although more studies are needed to confirm how this information should be incorporated into healthcare guidelines.</p>



<p>"Before anything is put into guidelines, the first step is always to validate the findings," says Dr. Alsakarneh. "Colleagues from the gastrointestinal community have reached out and are interested, so this is something we are working on."</p>



<p>As researchers investigate further, Dr. Alsakarneh says&amp;nbsp;<a>it's</a>&amp;nbsp;important that clinicians with PSC patients be aware of this association, tune into emerging evidence and keep their patients informed as findings develop.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Continuing a legacy of PSC discovery at Mayo Clinic</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Alsakarneh's research continues a legacy of PSC discovery at Mayo Clinic that&nbsp;dates back to&nbsp;the '70s. That was when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/larusso-nicholas-f-m-d/bio-20053658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nicholas LaRusso</a>, a gastroenterologist at Mayo Clinic, first began studying the cluster of symptoms that he eventually helped describe and define as PSC in a 1980&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7399227/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>.  </p>

<p>"It's important to me that this study comes from Mayo Clinic because Dr. LaRusso, who still has a lab here, made so much progress in this disease. He is the reason I came to Mayo Clinic to do my training," says Dr. Alsakarneh.</p>



<p>Alongside Dr. LaRusso, Dr. Alsakarneh next plans to lead Mayo Clinic research investigating why and how PSC increases cancer risk.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A genomic test co-developed by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> and <a href="https://www.skylinedx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SkylineDx</a> can identify whether people with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melanoma</a> are at low or high risk for cancer in their <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/swollen-lymph-nodes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353902%C2%A0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lymph nodes</a> — a finding that could guide treatment decisions and help some people avoid lymph node biopsy surgery. The study results are <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2840207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in JAMA Surgery.</p>



<p>In the largest prospective study of its kind, about 93% of people classified as low risk had no cancer in their lymph nodes, while about 25% in the high-risk group did. The multicenter clinical trial enrolled 1,761 people with early- or intermediate-stage melanoma at nine U.S. cancer centers between 2021 and 2024.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Decoding the tumor’s genomic blueprint</strong></h2>



<p>The test measures the activity of eight genes in a melanoma tumor and combines that data with a person's age and tumor thickness to estimate the chance that cancer has reached the lymph nodes. The Merlin CP-GEP Test analyzes tissue from the tumor already collected during an initial biopsy, so no additional procedure or visit is required for the test.</p>



<p>Sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed under anesthesia to remove one or a few lymph nodes and check for microscopic cancer. The procedure usually requires a second incision and can have side effects, yet nearly 80% of people who undergo the surgery have no cancer in their lymph nodes.</p>



<p>"Surgery will always be central to cancer care, but this study shows that sentinel lymph node surgery might be avoided for selected patients with melanoma," says first author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/hieken-tina-j-m-d/bio-20089011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tina Hieken, M.D.</a>, a surgical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/oncology/sections/overview/ovc-20198225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oncologist</a> at the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a> and co-principal investigator of the study. "This test lets us use a patient's own tumor biology to guide care with true precision."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Turning molecular insight into clinical impact</strong></h2>



<p>Melanoma is the deadliest form of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/skin-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20377605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin cancer</a>. While early-stage disease can often be treated successfully, once melanoma spreads to the lymph nodes, the risk of recurrence increases. Determining whether the cancer has reached the lymph nodes is a key step in guiding treatment.</p>



<p>"Melanoma progression is driven by subtle molecular processes that we're only beginning to understand," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/meves-alexander-m-d-m-b-a/bio-00027476" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alexander Meves, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dermatology/sections/overview/ovc-20420526" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dermatologist</a> at the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center who led earlier validation studies of the test. "This work translates that biology into tools that can improve care."</p>



<p>Researchers are now studying how incorporating the test into melanoma care might help healthcare professionals understand the risk of recurrence and guide follow-up care.</p>

<p>More than 4 million people in the U.S. are breast <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> survivors. GSM affects up to 70% of these survivors. Medications that stop the body from producing estrogen can prevent or stop the spread of breast cancer. However, these antiestrogen therapies, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hormone-therapy-for-breast-cancer/about/pac-20384943#:~:text=Medicines%20that%20stop%20the%20body%20from%20making%20estrogen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aromatase inhibitors</a>, also can exacerbate GSM symptoms.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our data shows that as many as 20% of breast cancer survivors on aromatase inhibitors will stop taking their medication prematurely because they cause severe GSM symptoms. This early discontinuation of their breast cancer therapy can lead to worse outcomes in breast cancer survivorship. So, clearly, nonhormonal treatment options for GSM are needed," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chen-anita-h-m-d/bio-20053260" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anita Chen, M.D.</a>, a gynecologist at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>. Dr. Chen is the lead author of a <a href="https://journals.lww.com/greenjournal/fulltext/9900/platelet_rich_plasma_for_genitourinary_syndrome_of.1369.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in Obstetrics &amp;amp; Gynecology. &amp;nbsp;<br>&amp;nbsp;<br>This need drove Dr. Chen to search for another option. Her team conducted a phase 1 clinical trial with 20 breast cancer survivors with GSM to test the efficacy of platelet-rich plasma (PRP), the part of the blood that holds healing properties, to see if it could help. Blood was drawn from each participant and then spun in a centrifuge to obtain platelets and plasma that have self-healing and regenerative effects. PRP was then injected diffusely once into the opening of the vagina and the vaginal canal in each participant.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"After six months, the breast cancer patients' GSM symptoms had significantly improved, including sexual function, urinary symptoms and overall quality of life, even amongst those taking estrogen blockers," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/trabuco-emanuel-c-m-d/bio-00028202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Emanuel Trabuco, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher and co-author of the study.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While vasomotor symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes and night sweats, can improve over time, GSM does not improve without treatment and worsens over time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"All of our participants completed the injection protocol and rigorous follow-up, which suggests that this population desires treatment for a bothersome condition, one that is likely underreported, underestimated and undertreated," says Dr. Chen. "Most importantly, none of the participants stopped their breast cancer treatment or experienced cancer recurrence during the study."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>PRP has been used for years in orthopedics and dermatology, and gynecologists have started looking into it to treat <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stress-incontinence/symptoms-causes/syc-20355727" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress urinary incontinence</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infertility/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20354325" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reproductive medicine</a> and GSM.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The next step in this research includes pursuing a phase 2 randomized controlled clinical trial to compare PRP injection with a placebo to treat GSM in breast cancer survivors and further evaluate its efficacy.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>Patients with breast cancer now have more options when it comes to radiation treatments. The goal is to remove any remaining cancer cells following chemotherapy or surgery.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"In other situations, we use radiation if the cancer is more advanced, or spread to the lymph nodes," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Advancements in technology allow healthcare professionals to treat patients more safely. One technique called "prone positioning" reduces the chance of beams targeting other organs. For this procedure, patients lie on their stomachs.</p>



<p>"We take advantage of gravity, the breast pulls away from the body, and we can treat the breast without exposing the underlying lung and heart to unnecessary radiation," explains Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is cutting-edge. Unlike traditional radiation, this procedure delivers X-rays directly to the targeted area from multiple angles, allowing for higher, more effective doses.</p>



<p>"Before intensity-modulated radiation therapy, we were not able to conform the dose around the chest wall," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>For patients undergoing radiation therapy, it's crucial to stay hydrated and try to sleep well to fight fatigue. It's also important to use sunscreen after treatment.</p>

But hope is on the horizon, thanks to a new <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic/quality/top-ranked" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> study that uncovers how prostate cancer exploits a protein&nbsp;in order to&nbsp;resist targeted therapies and evade the immune system.</p>



<p>Nuclear pores are entries to the nucleus made up of proteins called <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/genome-function-stability-nuclear-organization-cancer/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nucleoporins</a>. While nucleoporins usually stay at their post and help regulate the flow of molecules that can come in and out of the nucleus, researchers discovered that soluble POM121 — a subtype of the nucleoporin POM121 — uses its ability to navigate freely to help cancer cells grow and spread.</p>

<p></p>



<p><br>"Nobody had looked at the role of this soluble 'off-pore' nucleoporin because in gene expression analyses across databases, everything is classified under the primary nucleoporin. But through detailed analysis we saw an increase in sPOM121 in prostate cancer when compared to noncancerous tissue and a further increase in metastatic therapy resistant tumors," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.</p>

<p>"We started digging for its purpose and found it had a distinctly relevant role in driving prostate cancer progression to lethal stages of the disease," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo. The study combined patient tumor analyses, molecular profiling and preclinical models to identify the protein and test its role in metastatic prostate cancer.</p>



<p>The study builds on her&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30100187/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous research</a>, which identified POM121's key role in transporting cancer-promoting proteins into the nucleus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Logistic centers' that promote cancer</strong></h2>



<p>As a soluble protein, sPOM121 can roam freely in the nucleus, where DNA instructions are stored. "Because it's not attached to the structure that surrounds the nucleus, it can form condensates — which act like logistic centers — and bind to other proteins that regulate gene accessibility and activation," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.</p>



<p>Most notably, sPOM121 partners with a protein called SMARCA5 that modifies DNA packaging to allow a protein called beta-catenin to enhance its expression. Beta-catenin is known to drive therapy resistance and immunosuppressing genes.</p>



<p>Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo says this discovery offers a possible explanation for prostate cancer growth and spread when treated with standard therapy and poor response to immunotherapy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A potential key to treatment-resistant prostate cancer</strong></h2>



<p>The study tested whether blocking sPOM121-driven cancer programs like beta-catenin could improve the effectiveness of treatments such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, which help the immune system attack cancer.</p>



<p>"We found that targeting the soluble POM121-beta-catenin pathway really enhances the effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The tumors started getting a lot of T-cell infiltration and shrank," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo. "Beta-catenin inhibitors are currently being investigated in multiple tumor types, and our results provide the rationale to investigate the efficacy of these inhibitors alone or in combination with immunotherapy for prostate cancer."</p>



<p>Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo also pinpoints the strong unmet need to develop specific nucleoporin inhibitors that could target multiple cancer-driving signal pathways by disrupting these critical logistic centers. The disruption of these logistic centers by targeting sPOM121 would induce a blackout in the cancer cell, increasing the effectiveness of current therapies, but further investigation is needed to directly target sPOM121, says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Broader impact beyond prostate cancer</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo says this study has observed the accumulation of POM121 in multiple tumor types. Her team now hopes to investigate whether the soluble form, sPOM121, is a common cancer driver or plays an earlier role in disease progression.</p>



<p>"If this is really controlling fundamental pathways fueling tumor progression, targeting sPOM121 might potentially benefit more patients in the future," she says.</p>



<p>She also hopes the study will encourage researchers to investigate how cancer might exploit other off-pore nucleoporins.</p>



<p>"We believe sPOM121 is one of many other nucleoporins that orchestrate key transcriptional hubs in the depth of the nucleus. Cancer likes to have a lot of tools on its belt, so we propose these off-pore nucleoporins are selected and used efficiently during tumor evolution," says Dr. Rodriguez-Bravo.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>When a person's lungs are damaged, that organ's survival depends on a small but powerful set of cells that must choose whether to repair the tissue or fight infection. A new Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-64224-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> has uncovered the molecular "switch" that directs these cells down one path or the other, a discovery that could inform regenerative therapies for chronic lung diseases.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="683" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-683x1024.jpg" alt="Photo headshot of Dr. Brownfield" class="wp-image-406480" style="width:182px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/09/Brownfield-WF4747552_0001.jpg 1095w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 683px) 100vw, 683px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"We were surprised to find that these specialized cells cannot do both jobs at once," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/brownfield-douglas-g-ph-d/bio-20522531" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Douglas Brownfield, Ph.D.,</a> senior author of the study, which was published in Nature Communications. "Some commit to rebuilding, while others focus on defense. That division of labor is essential — and by uncovering the switch that controls it, we can start thinking about how to restore balance when it breaks down in disease."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It takes two</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>The new research centers on alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, which play a dual role in the lung. These cube-shaped cells secrete surfactant proteins that keep air sacs open, but they also act as reserve stem cells capable of regenerating alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells — the paper-thin cells that form the surface for gas exchange. This regenerative capacity makes AT2 cells essential for lung repair after injury.</p>



<p>For decades, scientists have known that these cells often fail to regenerate properly in lung diseases such as pulmonary fibrosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and severe viral infections like COVID-19. What remained unclear was how AT2 cells lose their stem cell capacity.</p>



<p>Using single-cell sequencing, imaging and preclinical injury models, the team mapped the developmental "life history" of AT2 cells. They found that newly formed AT2 cells stay flexible for about one to two weeks after birth before "locking in" to their specialized identity.</p>



<p>That timing is controlled by a molecular circuit involving three key regulators called PRC2, C/EBPα, and DLK1. The researchers showed that one of them, C/EBPα, acts like a clamp that suppresses stem cell activity. In adult lungs, AT2 cells must release this clamp after injury to regenerate.</p>



<p>The same molecular switch also directs whether AT2 cells repair lung tissue or defend against infection. That helps explain why infections often slow recovery from lung disease.</p>



<p>"When we think about lung repair, it's not just about turning things on — it's about removing the clamps that normally keep these cells from acting like stem cells," says Dr. Brownfield. "We discovered one of those clamps and how it times the ability of these cells to repair."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing organ failure</strong></h2>



<p>The discoveries could guide the development of therapies to fix AT2 cells that are broken in disease. Drugs that target C/EBPα, for example, may restore repair programs or reduce scarring in pulmonary fibrosis.</p>



<p>"This research brings us closer to being able to boost the lung's natural repair mechanisms, offering hope for preventing or reversing conditions where currently we can only slow progression," says Dr. Brownfield.</p>



<p>The findings may also guide earlier detection, helping clinicians identify when AT2 cells are stuck in one state and unable to regenerate. Such insights could lead to new biomarkers for lung disease. This work aligns with Mayo Clinic's Precure initiative, which focuses on detecting disease at its earliest stages — when interventions are most effective — and preventing progression before organ failure occurs.</p>



<p>At the same time, the research advances Mayo Clinic's Genesis initiative, which aims to prevent organ failure and restore function through regenerative medicine. The team is now testing strategies to remove the repressive clamp on human AT2 cells, expand them in culture and potentially use them for cell replacement therapy.</p>
