<p>Dr. Ethel Aguirre Flores broke her first bone before she learned to walk. Since then, she has endured more than 125 other fractures — femurs, arms, ribs and vertebrae. Her medical chart includes 41 surgeries and six metal rods that hold her limbs together.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Her most recent fracture happened just months ago when she broke her toe while dancing. Not long before that, her femur snapped while she was simply walking.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But through it all, her determination, perseverance and commitment to helping others have remained unbreakable.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (4:25) is in the downloads&amp;nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/VIDEO-SCRIPT-BRITTLE-BONE-DISEASE.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script.</a></strong>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Born with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/overview/specialty-groups/pediatric-metabolic-bone-disorders-clinic">osteogenesis imperfecta</a>, a rare genetic disorder also known as brittle bone disease, Dr. Aguirre Flores is now completing her residency in medical genetics and genomics at Mayo Clinic. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>She came to Mayo specifically to study under one of the leading physician-scientists in the world focused on treating brittle bone disease at the molecular level. <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/deyle-david-r-m-d/bio-00097430">Dr. David Deyle</a>, a clinical geneticist, has spent nearly 30 years studying the condition's genetic underpinnings and building the expertise needed to do what medicine has never done: develop a therapy that repairs it at its source.&amp;nbsp;In addition to leading research, Dr. Deyle devotes most of his time to patient care, seeing nearly 30 patients with rare genetic disorders each week.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our goal is to correct the underlying genetic defect of osteogenesis imperfecta," Dr. Deyle says. "That means going directly into the genome, because you can't transplant bone stem cells. You have to repair them at their source."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deyle is developing gene therapy to target the genetic mutation that disrupts collagen, the protein that gives bones their strength. The mutation produces a faulty form of collagen, which leaves bones weak and prone to fractures.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Deyle's team is pursuing two primary approaches. One uses gene editing, such as CRISPR, a tool that precisely cuts and modifies DNA, to eliminate the faulty genetic instructions. The other uses a small molecule therapy to strengthen bone density without altering DNA. Both approaches are inching closer to clinical trials.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We can do this in the lab," Dr. Deyle says. "The challenge is delivery — getting the therapy directly into the bone."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>That same precision guides the team's work across a range of rare conditions<strong>. </strong>One project involves classical <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ehlers-danlos-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20362125">Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</a>, a connective tissue disorder marked by fragile skin and poor wound healing. Dr. Deyle's team is using a combination of gene and cell therapies to give patients a second working copy of the gene they're missing. The modified cells are then reintroduced into the body to aid healing at the site of injury.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Another effort targets <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/neurofibromatosis-type-1/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350495">neurofibromatosis</a>, a disease that causes tumors to grow along nerves. Dr. Deyle's team was the first to use a viral vector to deliver a key therapeutic protein. The method, which relies on a modified virus to transport treatment directly into cells, could help advance gene therapies for other rare conditions.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While the science is groundbreaking, the stories behind it are equally compelling.<strong>&amp;nbsp;</strong>Some of the most determined minds behind this research in Dr. Deyle's lab know these conditions firsthand, including Dr. Aguirre Flores. She's the third person with brittle bone disease to train under his guidance.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"People with this condition know what it means to face setbacks," Dr. Deyle says. "That gives them a focus you can't teach. You can see it in Dr. Aguirre Flores — she's a fighter, and she pours everything she has into this work because of what she's lived through."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Aguirre Flores grew up in northern Mexico, the only daughter in a family of four children. Her parents encouraged her to chase every dream. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"They would always let me know anything's possible," she says. "You can do anything you want."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>She swam competitively, earning medals despite broken ribs. She painted with casts on her legs. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>At age 8, she met a care team in Texas that changed her view of what care could be. That's when she knew she wanted to become a doctor.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"They saw me as a child first, not just a diagnosis," Dr. Aguirre Flores says. "That changed everything." &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Now, she brings that same perspective to her own career. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I know what these children are going through. I want to help children with congenital disorders as a whole and help them live their childhood to the best," Dr. Aguirre Flores says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In June, she will graduate from Mayo Clinic's Medical Genetics and Genomics Residency and begin a new role as a pediatric geneticist in Texas.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I hope that my story brings hope and inspires others to not put limits on themselves," Dr. Aguirre Flores says. "And to always go after your dreams."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"This unique biobank resource overcomes a major barrier we've faced in the field, namely: limited access to standardized salivary specimens suited for salivary gland regeneration research. This collection provides a foundation for regenerative therapy development, especially for radiation-induced chronic dry mouth," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kannan-nagarajan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20233074" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nagarajan Kannan, Ph.D.</a>, lead author of the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41536-025-00410-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in NPJ Regenerative Medicine. Dr. Kannan is also the director of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/stem-cell-and-cancer-biology/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Stem Cell and Cancer Biology Laboratory</a>.</p>



<p>Nearly 70% of patients with head and neck cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy experience permanent damage to their salivary glands. People with this condition experience diminished quality of life from a constant feeling like cotton is lining their mouths. Besides being uncomfortable, chronic dry mouth can lead to difficulties with chewing, tasting, speaking and swallowing. It also can cause tooth decay.</p>



<p>"Chronic dry mouth can extend long after radiation treatments are complete. It's among the top concerns I hear from patients with head and neck cancer. Unfortunately, there aren't many therapeutics available commercially for these patients," says&amp;nbsp;co-author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/janus-jeffrey-jeff-r-m-d/bio-20206511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeffrey Janus, M.D.</a>, an ear, nose and throat specialist at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>One promising avenue of research is the cultivation of rare regenerative cells to greater numbers that can help people someday heal and grow new, healthy salivary gland cells. The biobank consists of specimens collected from 208 donors. From this repository, researchers have already found biomarkers for mature, saliva-producing cells, and with the help of a high-resolution protein map, they have identified the potential tissue origin of rare, self-renewing salivary cells.</p>



<p>The research team also developed a radiation injury model, which paired with the biobank, provides an integrated platform to discover new, personalized regenerative biotherapeutics.</p>

<p>September marks the start of soybean harvest in Mankato, Minnesota, a busy time of year when farmers can't afford to be away from their fields for long. So, when Craig Smith, 66, began experiencing a burning sensation while urinating, he went to his family physician right away.</p>



<p>He was prescribed antibiotics, but his symptoms worsened. When Smith began to pass blood, his wife insisted that they drive straight to Mayo Clinic in Rochester — about an hour and a half away. There, Mayo Clinic physicians diagnosed him with metastatic urothelial cancer, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bladder-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20356104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bladder cancer</a>, which had spread to his spine.</p>



<p>Smith recalls receiving a phone call late that night from his Mayo Clinic doctor, who asked him if he wanted to just maintain his health for a few years or cure his cancer.</p>



<p>"I said, 'I'd like you to cure it,'" says Smith.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking a bladder cancer cure</strong></h2>



<p>Smith's father had been a farmer, which was his dream too. But his father suggested he gain additional skills to supplement his farming income. Following his father's advice and encouragement from his high school welding teacher, Smith pursued his teaching certificate in welding. What he initially thought would be five or six years of teaching turned into a 45-year career developing welding programs at several local schools while also raising cattle and growing soybeans and corn on his 2,000-acre farm. Through his welding programs, he has trained several welders now employed by local manufacturing companies.</p>



<p>After his diagnosis in 2023, Smith took a hiatus from teaching and farming to focus on his cancer treatments at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato</a>, which included chemotherapy, radiation and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>Metastatic urothelial cancer that has spread beyond the bladder usually is considered incurable and inoperable. However, Smith responded well to chemotherapy and radiation to his spine, which made his oncologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/orme-jacob-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20545524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jacob Orme, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, and urologist, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shah-paras-h-m-d/bio-20571894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paras Shah, M.D.</a>, consider Smith for a new, surgical approach to treatment.</p>



<p>Smith proceeded with the proposed surgery and had his bladder, prostate and 36 lymph nodes removed.</p>



<p>"In Mr. Smith's bladder, we found viable cancer cells that would have led to a relapse. Now, however, he is nearly two years from diagnosis and remains disease-free," says Dr. Shah.</p>



<p>Smith's positive response to treatment and surgery has spurred a clinical trial testing this aggressive approach in other bladder cancer patients. Currently, 17 participants are enrolled, and the results so far have been promising.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)"><blockquote><p>"It takes brave patients like Mr. Smith and these other patients that we've seen who are excited for the possibility of a cure but also are excited about the possibility of helping other people with cancers like them in the future."</p><cite>Jacob orme, M.D., Ph.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>Advances in cancer treatment, such as immunotherapy that harnesses the body's immune system to fight cancer and the identification of biomarkers in the blood or urine that show how well a patient is responding to treatment, are helping the physicians select who will benefit most from surgery.</p>



<p>"The impetus for this study is to attack the cancer from multiple approaches, including treatments that cover head-to-toe and treatments that are directed right at the source tumor," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boorjian-stephen-a-m-d/bio-00092877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen A. Boorjian, M.D.</a>, who is the David and Anne Luther Chair of Urology at Mayo Clinic and a lead proponent of the study.</p>



<p>"We want to remove the root of the cancer after we've burned off the leaves," adds Dr. Orme.</p>



<p>A team of researchers, physicians and clinical trials staff expedited the clinical trial through an accelerated pathway called a Rapid Activation Trial. It's part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic to launch new clinical trials swiftly and effectively.</p>



<p>"Shortening activation timelines allows us to make a difference to more patients and their families," says Michelle Monosmith, Mayo Clinic Office of Clinical Trials operations administrator.</p>



<p>The study is supported by a generous donation by Roald J. and Carol T. Beerman to Mayo Clinic and has been prioritized by Dr. Boorjian and Chair of Oncology <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heath-elisabeth-i-m-d/bio-20576547" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elisabeth Heath, M.D.</a>, to achieve more cures for men and women with bladder cancer.</p>



<p>"Our only goal is to help our patients live better and longer," says Dr. Orme.</p>



<p>That's what Smith plans to do as he continues to farm, teach and spend time with his family.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new discovery by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers could mean more donor hearts are available for heart transplant, giving more people a second chance at life.</p>



<p>In findings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00653-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published</a> in Nature Cardiovascular Research, a team led by Mayo Clinic cardiac surgeon <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tang-paul-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20554335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Tang, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, identified a biological process that contributes to donor heart injury during cold storage. The researchers found that a drug already used to treat heart conditions can prevent this damage.</p>



<p>Heart transplantation is the most effective treatment for end-stage heart failure, yet fewer than half of donor hearts are ultimately used. One major reason is the relatively short window for transplanting a donated heart into a patient, due to concerns over low donor heart function that comes from leaving a heart in cold storage too long. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Why donor hearts deteriorate in cold storage</strong></h2>



<p>Although cold storage slows metabolism and helps preserve tissue, prolonged exposure to cold storage conditions can lead to molecular changes that compromise how well the heart performs after transplant. One complication is called primary graft dysfunction, in which the transplanted heart cannot pump blood effectively after surgery. This may affect up to 20% of recipients to varying degrees.</p>



<p>To investigate why this damage occurs, the researchers focused on a protein inside heart cells called the mineralocorticoid receptor, which plays a role in how cells respond to stress. During cold storage, they found that this protein undergoes a process in which the protein clumps together in a way that harms the heart cells, called liquid-liquid phase separation. This process promotes cardiac damage from increased inflammation and cell death, making the heart less likely to function well after transplant.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preventing damage with a common drug</strong></h2>



<p>To test whether the process could be prevented, the researchers treated donor hearts with a drug called canrenone, which blocks mineralocorticoid receptor activity. In human donor hearts stored beyond the typical timeframe, treatment with the drug nearly tripled their pumping strength compared to hearts stored without it. The hearts also showed better blood flow and fewer signs of cell injury. The findings suggest canrenone may help extend the safe storage period for donor hearts by improving the heart’s pumping strength to increase chances of a successful transplant.</p>



<p>"As a cardiovascular surgeon, I’ve personally experienced in the operating room how every additional hour of preservation can impact the likelihood of whether a donor heart can return to normal function after transplantation," Dr. Tang says. "This discovery may give us a new tool to preserve heart function for longer during storage, improve transplant outcomes and enhance patient access to lifesaving transplants."</p>



<p>The study's findings also have the potential to improve the preservation of other transplantable organs. Similar protein clustering was observed in donor kidneys, lungs and livers during cold storage. This suggests that the same strategy may help expand transplant options across multiple organ systems.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic collaborated with the University of Michigan on this research. Review the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44161-025-00653-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>For graduate students aiming to become scientists, Mayo Clinic's biomedical research training environment fosters a certain kind of thinking: How can new knowledge eventually improve the treatment of disease? "As students, we see the integration of research and patient care and what you can learn from both sides of the picture," says Ph.D. candidate Carli Stewart.</p>

<p>For Stewart, the desire to become a scientist began at home. From a young age, she was aware of her father's diagnosis with cancer and the struggles he faced as his body became resistant to some treatments. Four years ago, when she became a predoctoral student at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/phd-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a>, she chose a research project addressing blood cancers like his.</p>



<p>Working under the mentorship of Mayo Clinic hematologist oncologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, she has studied specially engineered immune cells, called chimeric antigen receptor-T cells or CAR-T cells, that are used to treat blood cancers like leukemia. She identified a signaling protein that, when neutralized, boosts the function of CAR-T cells by keeping them from reaching a state of "exhaustion." She and Dr. Kenderian's team published <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51978-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">their findings</a> in Nature Communications.</p>



<p>Stewart was delighted to learn that the journey of the new concept didn't stop there. "The approach she explored is novel, and her findings show there's a solid rationale to see whether it may help patients," says Dr. Kenderian.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'An incredible learning curve'</strong></h2>



<p>As the opportunity to advance the idea has emerged, Stewart has begun to learn about developing a clinical trial. "It's been an incredible learning curve," she says of taking a discovery beyond the lab space.</p>



<p>Close collaboration between researchers and clinicians at Mayo is what makes the steps of translation — from discovery to the clinic — happen efficiently, says Dr. Kenderian. Students like Stewart have opportunities to learn about the steps that shape clinical trials to bring new treatments to patients.</p>



<p>She and Dr. Kenderian met with a panel of Mayo physicians to get feedback about the design of a phase 1 clinical trial, which tests the safety of a new approach in a small cohort of patients who are interested in participating. "It was a great opportunity for me to hear how things are translated into the clinic, what questions and concerns clinicians may have, and how feasible our approach may be," she says.</p>



<p>"CAR-T cell therapy can be remarkable for some patients who have no other options, and the hope is to develop a more durable, lasting approach. This part of the research is still in early stages, but it's a very exciting project, and I feel lucky to be a part of it."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Beyond what seemed possible'</strong></h2>



<p>Many Ph.D. students at Mayo Clinic are preparing for future careers in academia and industry. Another way they can learn about research that involves human participants is through an internship at Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-clinical-translational-science/offices/office-of-clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Office of Clinical Trials</a>. Working with Mayo's clinical trials coordinators, students have followed a clinical trial underway and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/learning-the-ropes-of-clinical-trials-to-bring-cures-to-patients/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned about designing a study</a> that provides meaningful data and protects the rights, safety and welfare of patients who volunteer to participate.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Sirpilla-Olivia-L._30026831_20241104.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402613" style="width:258px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Sirpilla-Olivia-L._30026831_20241104.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Sirpilla-Olivia-L._30026831_20241104-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Olivia Sirpilla</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>But for some students, like Olivia Sirpilla, who is graduating in May from Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, a long series of successful experiments in Dr. Kenderian's lab has opened the door to the next stages. Sirpilla's Ph.D. research looked at developing specially engineered stem cells from fat tissue as a treatment to calm the inflammation that occurs in immune diseases.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-024-01195-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team's results</a>, published in Nature Biomedical Engineering, have set the stage for two potential clinical trials. One may be applicable to graft-versus-host-disease, an immune system complication that can occur after a stem cell transplant. The findings also may be applicable to the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, particularly for patients who no longer respond to medications.</p>



<p>To design these clinical trials, Sirpilla and Dr. Kenderian are working with teams of Mayo clinicians who specialize in these disorders and their standard treatments. "I chose to come to Mayo Clinic for my Ph.D. to conduct lab research that would be highly translational," she says. "But to spend my thesis work developing a new cell therapy platform that is ready to be translated into a clinical trial is beyond what I thought possible in a Ph.D."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Research that reaches patients' daily lives &amp;nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Stephanie Zawada began her Ph.D. with an interest in computational approaches to research, but she has always strived to make advances that reach patients' daily lives.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="640" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Zawada-Stephanie-K._30026706_202501151428.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402614" style="width:261px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Zawada-Stephanie-K._30026706_202501151428.jpg 640w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Zawada-Stephanie-K._30026706_202501151428-240x300.jpg 240w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Stephanie Zawada</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Her thesis project aimed to help physicians assess people who have experienced a stroke and may be at risk for another. &amp;nbsp;She engaged two Ph.D. mentors who shared their expertise: <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/demaerschalk-bart-m-m-d/bio-20507430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bart Demaerschalk, M.D.</a>, &amp;nbsp;and &amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/erickson-bradley-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-00077505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bradley Erickson, M.D., Ph.D.</a> Dr. Demaerschalk is a professor of neurology who treats patients with stroke at Mayo Clinic in Arizona and has a longstanding interest in digital health and using telemedicine to reach remote patients, and Dr. Erickson is a professor of radiology who leads artificial intelligence studies at his lab at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.</p>



<p>Zawada "took a very innovative approach, exploring digital tools that may help a healthcare team continue to monitor and evaluate patients who have been discharged from the hospital but remain at risk for stroke recurrence," says Dr. Demaerschalk.</p>



<p>First, Zawada scoured available databases to identify attributes, including mood changes and sleep patterns, that can signal an oncoming stroke and can be captured by smartphone-based technology known as "wearables." Then she worked with her mentors and members of the Center for Digital Health to develop a pilot clinical trial with patients who volunteered to participate in a study from their homes.</p>



<p>Zawada designed a study that met the requirements of an institutional review board, or IRB, to address regulatory compliance. Aiming to get information from a "real-world" setting — where patients interact with app-based tools and the tools account for the range of daily activities — added logistical and mathematical complexity to the project. She worked with Dr. Demaerschalk and Mayo Clinic hospital-based stroke teams to recruit a cohort of 35 patients who gave consent to be part of the clinical trial. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Interacting with patients and hearing their concerns is the best way to advance useful technologies," Zawada says of designing the trial. "You want the clinical trial process to be as simple as possible for participants, and the only way to learn what tools and designs can make their lives better is to listen to them."</p>



<p>Her <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/11/3595" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">results showed</a> that several behavioral and mood changes related to cerebrovascular disease can be captured with the use of wearable devices, even from patients going about their daily routines far from a hospital. The approach will need further investigation as a strategy to improve care and in the development of clinical trial measures, but the training to conduct a clinical trial is something that Zawada will take to the next stages of her career. </p>



<p>"Setting up a clinical trial is a complex process and really involves a team," says Zawada, who graduates in May and plans to continue researching wearables for patients who have other severe health conditions. "My thesis project was a multi-site collaborative effort — putting together the clinical questions, the new technology and the data analysis, the connection with patients — it's why I came to train at Mayo in the first place. As a student, I couldn't have done this project anywhere else."</p>

<p>José Villalta prided himself on providing for his wife and son, first by working construction jobs and then by canning vegetables at Faribault Foods. He was known for being strong and capable, with dark eyes and an easy smile. But in his early 40s that changed, and quickly. "I don't feel the same," he told his wife, Sylvie. His muscles, once one of his defining features, grew progressively weaker. He had trouble walking. Within months, he had to use a cane, then a wheelchair, to get around.</p>



<p>Doctors told him to take more vitamins. They tried acupuncture and electroshock therapy. A specialist biopsied a piece of his leg muscle but could not determine the cause of his deteriorating health. By the time he made his way to Mayo Clinic, he could no longer muster the strength to lift his arms or even hold up his head. "He was like a puppet," says Sylvie.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/santilli-ashley-r-m-d/bio-20572061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ashley Santilli, M.D.</a>, the clinical fellow at Mayo Clinic assigned to his case, told the family not to lose hope. "She was really persistent," recalls Sylvie. "She said 'We will get to the bottom of this — we will figure out what's wrong.'"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Integrated know-how</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="853" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Santilli_Ashley_R._MD_20995750_201806200441-853x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402636" style="width:250px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Santilli_Ashley_R._MD_20995750_201806200441-853x1024.jpg 853w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Santilli_Ashley_R._MD_20995750_201806200441-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Santilli_Ashley_R._MD_20995750_201806200441-768x922.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Santilli_Ashley_R._MD_20995750_201806200441.jpg 1250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 853px) 100vw, 853px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ashley Santilli, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>At the time, Dr. Santilli was training under <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/liewluck-teerin-m-d/bio-20524561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teerin Liewluck, M.D.</a>, a neurologist who had trained under the late <a href="https://www.worldmusclesociety.org/news/view/in-memory-of-andrew-engel-a-pioneer-of-neuromuscular-disorders-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Engel, M.D.</a>, a pioneer of muscle disease research. Over nearly six decades at Mayo Clinic, Dr. Engel discovered several new neuromuscular disorders and identified the underlying mechanisms of many others.</p>



<p>"One thing he always told me was that he was still learning, even after all those years," says Dr. Liewluck. "He taught me that I need to keep an open mind, because there's always new things to learn and discover."</p>



<p>Because Villalta's mysterious illness arose rapidly and later in life, Dr. Liewluck thought the cause was probably not genetic. Congenital muscle diseases typically emerge slowly in early childhood. But when he looked at Villalta's muscle biopsy under the microscope, he was surprised to see abnormally large mitochondria, the energy-producing structures often called the "powerhouses of the cell." Giant mitochondria (also known as megaconia) are associated with a type of congenital muscular dystrophy caused by mutations in a gene called CHKB.</p>



<p>To make sure they were not missing a new presentation of this incurable condition, the team requested genetic testing, which confirmed that Villalta did not harbor any suspicious CHKB variants. So they returned to the biopsy in search of more clues.</p>



<p>"The unique thing about neuromuscular medicine at Mayo is we get specific training in diagnostic tests, like biopsy interpretation and EMG," says Dr. Santilli, referring to electromyography, a test that measures muscle response to nerve stimulation. "You get to be the whole provider for a particular patient, instead of relying on other specialists to help us interpret those tests."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new disease</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="819" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Liewluck_Teerin_15093484_20220516-819x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402637" style="width:243px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Liewluck_Teerin_15093484_20220516-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Liewluck_Teerin_15093484_20220516-240x300.jpg 240w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Liewluck_Teerin_15093484_20220516-768x960.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Liewluck_Teerin_15093484_20220516-1229x1536.jpg 1229w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Liewluck_Teerin_15093484_20220516-1638x2048.jpg 1638w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Teerin Liewluck, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Villalta's case gave Dr. Liewluck a sense of déjà vu. He recalled another patient, years earlier, who was <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34617293/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">part of a study</a> on a severe form of muscle inflammation. That patient's biopsy also was marked by giant mitochondria. The patient's story was only pieced together later: an adult who developed muscle weakness, but whose illness was complicated by an underlying cancer. Treated by another physician, the patient initially improved with immunotherapy, but ultimately the cancer claimed her life.</p>



<p>To better understand Villalta's muscle disease, the researchers performed a series of special stains on his biopsy, each revealing various aspects of muscle structure and pathology. In addition to the unusually large mitochondria within his muscle fibers, they found evidence of inflammation, indicating an autoimmune process was at play. The team believed that Villalta's immune system was mistakenly attacking his muscles. If they were right, then immunotherapy might help him regain his strength.</p>



<p>"We couldn't guarantee or predict the outcome," says Dr. Liewluck. </p>



<p>They told Villalta that he would be the first patient they treated with this new disease, which they called immune-mediated megaconial myopathy (IMMM). They treated him aggressively with regular rounds of intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids. And he got better.</p>



<p>Before treatment, Villalta's levels of creatine kinase, a blood biomarker commonly used to monitor muscle damage, were sky high. With treatment, those levels dropped back within the normal range, suggesting that his overactive immune system had been put in check. More importantly, Villalta felt stronger and required less assistance, showering on his own, tinkering in his garage — even driving himself to rehab.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote has-medium-font-size" style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)"><blockquote><p>"To be able to help him, even in a small way, to get back some of that independence that he lost, to get back to doing things that he wants to be doing, was amazing...That is 100% why I went into medicine."</p><cite>Ashley Santilli, M.D.</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Unfortunately, Villalta's illness may have gone too long without treatment to allow a full recovery. Chronic inflammation and repeated muscle damage can gradually lead to the replacement of healthy muscle tissue with fat and scar tissue.</p>



<p>"That gives you evidence that you need to catch these cases earlier," says Dr. Liewluck.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Earlier answers</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/IMMM-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402647" style="width:375px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/IMMM-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/IMMM-300x225.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/IMMM-768x576.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/IMMM-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/IMMM.jpg 1600w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patients with immune-mediated megaconial myopathy have enlarged mitochondria in their muscle tissue.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The team turned to the Mayo Clinic Muscle Pathology database to see if they could find other patients with this new disease within recent years. They identified two more patients, who shared the same distinctive features — profound muscle weakness in adulthood, strikingly enlarged mitochondria, inflammatory reaction in muscle tissue and elevated creatine kinase levels. Working in collaboration with an outside institute, they uncovered a third case. Along with Villalta and the case from the prior research study, the count had risen to five. Villalta and the two newer patients, all of whom received immunotherapy, <a href="https://www.neurology.org/doi/10.1212/WNL.0000000000210001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">responded well</a> to treatment.</p>



<p>Now, Dr. Liewluck is delving deep into Mayo Clinic's extensive muscle tissue repository, combing through biopsies that span not just recent years, but decades, in search of other overlooked cases — patients who may have had IMMM long before it was recognized as a distinct entity.</p>



<p>"I actually think there might be many more than we know," says Dr. Santilli.</p>



<p>Interestingly, all the patients they have identified thus far have also had some form of pancreatic disease, such as pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis. Though the link<a> i</a>s <a>n</a>ot entirely clear, the pancreas expresses high levels of choline kinase beta, the same protein that is disrupted in CHKB-related muscular dystrophy. Dr. Liewluck is collaborating with neuroimmunologist <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/dubey-div-m-b-b-s/bio-20435080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Div Dubey, M.B.B.S.</a>, to try to identify the antibody that triggers the immune attack, ultimately causing disease.</p>



<p>Once they find that autoantibody, they can test for it in the blood to diagnose more patients with IMMM. For now, they will have to rely on their expert review of muscle biopsies combined with clinical observations.</p>



<p>Though Villalta&nbsp;is not back to his old self, he is happy that his case has already helped others. And he is making the most of the strength he has.</p>



<p>By last spring, Villalta had recovered enough to travel to his home country of El Salvador. His family helped him take a walk on the beach and watched over him as he swam in the ocean. Until recently, it was more than he thought was possible.</p>

<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — <a href="https://www.alzheimers.net/what-is-picks-disease" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pick's disease</a>, a neurodegenerative disease of unknown genetic origin, is a rare type of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frontotemporal-dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354737?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frontotemporal dementia</a> that affects people under the age of 65. The condition causes changes in personality, behavior and sometimes language impairment. In patients with the disease, tau proteins build up and form abnormal clumps called Pick bodies, which restrict nutrients to the brain and cause neurodegeneration. The only way to diagnose the disease is by looking at brain tissue under a microscope after a person dies.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.science.org%2Fdoi%2F10.1126%2Fsciadv.adt6105&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CDeWidt.Lynda%40mayo.edu%7C2a428ea388424d51e05d08dd8ce47945%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638821635090355711%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=r8QqTZcm3HLUbbyNMzv9qfD49pB4aThHvZYLpRwY%2B5U%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0">study</a>, Mayo Clinic researchers have identified gene expression changes in the brains of people with Pick's disease. Since Pick's disease is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that cannot be diagnosed during life, their findings offer valuable insights that may help guide the development of biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.</p>



<p>Researchers at Mayo Clinic in Florida, University College London in England and collaborators worldwide have established the Pick's Disease International Consortium to study a specific <em>MAPT </em>gene variation known as <em>MAPT </em>H2 that makes the tau protein and acts as a driver of disease. They investigated a connection between the gene and disease risk, age at onset, and duration of Pick's disease. Their findings are reported in <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1474442224000838?utm_campaign=STMJ_219742_AUTH_SERV_PA&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_acid=81527593&amp;amp;SIS_ID=&amp;amp;dgcid=STMJ_219742_AUTH_SERV_PA&amp;amp;CMX_ID=&amp;amp;utm_in=DM467488&amp;amp;utm_source=AC_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Neurology</a>.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers identified the first <em>MAPT</em> gene mutations for a behavioral form of dementia in 1998, and other genetic changes associated with related dementias in 2001, which paved the way to understanding the mechanisms of tau-related disease. This new study confirms a tau genetic factor linked specifically to Pick's disease and opens up new avenues of therapeutic design.</p>

<p>"Our research could have profound implications for the development of therapies for Pick's disease and other related neurodegenerative diseases, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/progressive-supranuclear-palsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20355659?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">progressive supranuclear palsy</a>," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/ross-owen-a-ph-d/bio-00093014" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Owen Ross, Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic neuroscientist and senior author of the paper. The consortium hosts a database of clinical, pathological and demographic information about patients with the disease who donated their brain tissue for science.</p>



<p>To conduct the study, researchers investigated brain samples of 338 patients confirmed to have Pick's disease to compare with blood samples from 1,312 neurologically healthy individuals. Patients confirmed to have the disease came from 35 brain banks and hospitals in North America, Europe and Australia between 2020 and 2023. The <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/departments-divisions/department-neuroscience-florida/biorepositories/mayo-clinic-brain-bank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Brain Bank</a> was among the sites in the study that provided the largest collection of samples.</p>



<p>Analyzing DNA from the blood samples and brain tissue, the research team recorded baseline information on study participants, including age at disease onset, age at death for those with Pick's disease, and sex and age at blood collection for the control group. Disease duration was calculated by the difference between age at Pick's disease onset and age at death. In addition, the researchers looked at clinical characteristics such as clinical diagnosis, impairment in behavior and language.</p>



<p>"We found that the <em>MAPT</em> H2 genetic variant is associated with an increased risk of Pick's disease in people of European descent," says Dr. Ross. "We were only able to determine that because of the global consortium, which greatly increased the sample size of pathology cases to study with Pick's disease."</p>



<p>The team's next steps are to expand the consortium to the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America, further resolve the genetic architecture of the disease, and assess this specific genetic variant as a biomarker or test for clinical diagnosis of Pick's disease. There is currently no clinical test or diagnosis available for Pick's disease. For the first time, the creation of the consortium may allow for the development of a clinical test.</p>



<p>Funding for this research at Mayo Clinic was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the State of Florida Ed and Ethel Moore Alzheimer’s Disease Research Program, and Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong>&nbsp;May is National Cancer Research Month, and May 20 is Clinical Trials Day.</em></p>



<p>A cancer diagnosis is an emotional experience. Learning that you have cancer can create feelings of hopelessness, fear and sadness. This is especially true if your cancer is advanced or available treatments are unable to stop or slow its growth.</p>



<p>"Often, when patients are diagnosed with&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a>, they feel hopeless and scared. Clinical trials are one way patients can be proactive. They can make a choice in how their care is going to be," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/block-matthew-s-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Block, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic medical oncologist.</p>



<p>Cancer clinical trials help physician-scientists test new and better ways to control and treat cancer. During a clinical trial, participants receive specific interventions, and researchers determine if those interventions are safe and effective. Interventions studied in clinical trials might be new cancer drugs or new combinations of drugs, new medical procedures, new surgical techniques or devices, new ways to use existing treatments, and lifestyle or behavior changes.</p>



<p>Clinical trials provide access to potential treatments under investigation, giving options to people who otherwise may face limited choices. "Clinical trials open the door to a new hope that maybe we can fight their cancer back and give them a better quality of life," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoffrey Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic radiologist, nuclear medicine specialist and co-chair of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;Experimental and Novel Therapeutics Disease Group.</p>



<p>You will receive cancer treatment if you participate in a clinical trial. "I think one common misperception about clinical trials is that if you enter a clinical trial, you may not get treatment (receive a placebo). And that's actually very much not true. Most clinical trials are looking at one treatment compared to another treatment," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/boughey-judy-c-m-d/bio-00027350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Judy C. Boughey, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic surgical oncologist, chair of Breast and Melanoma Surgical Oncology at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and chair of the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center Breast Cancer Disease Group.</p>

Block, Johnson and Boughey discuss the importance of clinical trials in cancer care:</strong></p>

<p>Clinical trials are a significant part of cancer care at Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center. Cancer care teams work together across specialties to make sure the right clinical trials are available to serve the needs of people with cancer who come to Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>"We are very particular in how we select the clinical trials that we have available for patients," says Dr. Boughey. "We want to have the best trials available for our patients. Some of the clinical trials are evaluating drugs — we are so excited about those drugs, but we can't prescribe those drugs for patients without having that trial. And so we will actually fight to try to get that trial open here to have it available as an opportunity for our patients."</p>



<p>If you choose to participate in a clinical trial, you will continue to receive cancer care. "For most patients that we evaluate, there's always the standard of care treatment option for those patients. And then, in many situations, there's also a clinical trial that the patient can participate in," says Dr. Boughey.</p>



<p>People who participate in clinical trials help make new and better cancer care available for future patients. The treatments available for cancer patients today exist because of the clinical trial participants of yesterday. "We couldn't advance medicine if it wasn't for people volunteering for trials. And the promise from our side is to say we're not going to put patients on trials or offer trials for them to consider unless we think there's a good chance that they'll get a benefit or that society at large will get a benefit," says Dr. Johnson.</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Participating in a clinical trial may give you access to cutting-edge treatment, improve your quality of life and extend your time with loved ones.</p>



<p>"It's definitely worth reaching out to your healthcare provider and asking, 'What clinical trials could I be a potential candidate for?'" says Dr. Boughey. "And remember, you can ask this of your surgical oncologist, your medical oncologist, your radiation oncologist, or any of the physicians you're seeing because there are trials in all disciplines. There are also ongoing trials that require the collection of tissue or the donation of blood. They can also be important in trying to help future generations as we continue to work to end cancer."</p>

Explore these&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/participate/clinical-trials/facts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ</a>&amp;nbsp;about cancer clinical trials, and ask your care team if a clinical trial might be right for you.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.regenmedmn.org/">Regenerative Medicine Minnesota</a> has awarded funding to three projects aimed at strengthening Minnesota's capabilities for developing and delivering therapies that replace, restore, rejuvenate or regenerate damaged cells, tissues or organs.</p>



<p>Co-led by the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic, Regenerative Medicine Minnesota brings together the state's leading research institutions to accelerate breakthroughs and bring new therapies to patients across the state.</p>



<p>The funded projects were selected for their potential to overcome challenges that slow the development and delivery of new therapies. Each project aims to build sustainable, widely accessible resources to help move regenerative treatments from the lab to patients more quickly.</p>



<p>The projects are:</p>



<p><strong>Derivation of Induced Pluripotent (Adult) Stem Cell Lines in Minnesota with Superior HLA Compatibility for Manufacturing Clinical Cell Therapy Products</strong></p>



<p>James Dutton, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>This initiative tackles a key challenge in regenerative medicine: access to clinical-grade starting materials. The project will generate high-quality, regulatory-compliant induced pluripotent (adult) stem cell (iPSC) lines with less risk of the immune system rejecting the cells. These lines will be made available to researchers across Minnesota, enabling the development of versatile, cost-effective cell therapies that can benefit a broad range of patients. By building a local supply of standardized starting materials, the project provides a long-term advantage to Minnesota's research community.</p>



<p><br><strong>The Genome Engineering for Regenerative Medicine (GERM) Consortium</strong></p>



<p>David Largaespada, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>Addressing the critical need for quality and safety standards in gene-edited therapies, this new consortium will bring together academic and industry experts to establish best practices for gene delivery, editing and evaluation. The GERM Consortium will provide essential guidance and resources to ensure that genetically engineered therapies are developed with precision and safety. Through this collaborative effort, Minnesota will become a hub for innovation and regulatory compliance in cell and gene therapy.</p>



<p><strong>Minnesota BRIDGE — Boosting Regenerative Medicine Innovation through Development, Growth, and Engagement</strong></p>



<p>Melanie Graham, Ph.D., University of Minnesota</p>



<p>This project focuses on a major translational bottleneck: the lack of robust preclinical models. Minnesota BRIDGE will create a state-of-the-art translational research infrastructure that enables more predictive preclinical testing of regenerative therapies. By establishing this capability, Minnesota will become one of the few places in the nation equipped to accelerate therapy development with cutting-edge preclinical models — streamlining the path to clinical trials and patient care.</p>



<p>Together, these projects advance Regenerative Medicine Minnesota's goal of bringing new therapies to patients in Minnesota and beyond while establishing the state as a leader in regenerative medicine.</p>



<p>###</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Simultaneous bariatric surgery and liver transplant for patients who are severely obese is safe and improves long-term health outcomes, according to a recent Mayo Clinic study. This combined approach offers a needed solution for these patients who are often denied a lifesaving liver transplant due to their weight.</p>



<p>The 10-year study, published in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168827825001394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Hepatology</a>, compared patients who received only a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/liver-transplant/about/pac-20384842" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver transplant</a> with those who underwent both a liver transplant and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/about/pac-20394258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="200" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Julie-Heimbach_WF4419268_0003-200x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402469" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Julie-Heimbach_WF4419268_0003-200x300.jpg 200w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Julie-Heimbach_WF4419268_0003.jpg 534w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Julie Heimbach, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The combined approach resulted in sustained weight loss, reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and lower risk of fatty liver disease recurrence. Importantly, the combined procedure posed no additional risks compared to liver transplant alone.</p>



<p>"We've been amazed by the transformation our patients experience," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/heimbach-julie-k-m-d/bio-20054676" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julie Heimbach, M.D.</a>, director of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Transplant Center</a> in Minnesota and the study's senior author. "This dual approach prevents long-term obesity complications like diabetes, heart disease and cancer, while also preventing fatty liver disease recurrence."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How obesity and liver disease are connected</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="250" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kellogg-Todd-A.-MD_11728213_201710030353-250x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-402470" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kellogg-Todd-A.-MD_11728213_201710030353-250x300.jpg 250w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/04/Kellogg-Todd-A.-MD_11728213_201710030353.jpg 667w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><sup>Todd Kellogg, M.D.</sup></figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The percentage of liver transplant candidates in the U.S. with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a> continues to climb, with more than 41% of candidates having a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/in-depth/bmi-calculator/itt-20084938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">body mass index</a> above 30 in 2022. Obesity puts people at risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, or MASLD, formerly known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonalcoholic fatty liver disease</a>. It's a condition where excess fat accumulates in the liver, which can lead to inflammation, scarring and advanced liver disease. Patients with a body mass index of 40 are more likely to be denied a transplant due to their weight.</p>



<p>"Since MASLD is a leading cause of liver failure, it only makes sense to protect the precious, lifegiving new liver from the same damage that led to the patient needing a transplant in the first place. Safely combining the two procedures protects the transplanted liver and can provide profound health benefits to these patients," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kellogg-todd-a-m-d/bio-20055725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Kellogg, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic bariatric surgeon and the study's co-author.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What about using new prescription medications for weight loss?</h2>



<p>New weight loss medications, such as GLP-1s, are being used to help some pre-transplant and post-transplant patients manage their weight. Still, Mayo Clinic experts say bariatric surgery remains an important option for patients with severe obesity due to its safety, proven effectiveness and lasting results. Another <a href="https://journals.lww.com/kidney360/citation/9900/medical_therapy_versus_bariatric_surgery_in_kidney.643.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Mayo study</a> related to kidney transplant patients supports this.</p>



<p>"The patients that we're talking about really have a significant amount of extra weight. The issue with the GLP-1 medications is they are effective in terms of weight loss as well as other benefits which are being identified, but they may not get these patients with severe obesity to their lasting goal of a healthier weight," Dr. Heimbach says.</p>

<p>Bringing together experts from different medical specialties is essential when treating these patients, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/diwan-ty-s-m-d/bio-20507516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ty Diwan, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic transplant surgeon and the study's co-author.</p>



<p>"This study shows that caring for these complex patients extends beyond the transplant itself," Dr. Diwan says. "Multidisciplinary care is required to maximize patient outcomes, and that is what we see in this data.&amp;nbsp;By bringing together experts in very different fields, we've improved patient care and overall health outcomes."</p>
