<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — The immune system is meant to protect the body from infection and disease. But with age, it can become less capable of doing so. However, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have found that some older people maintain "immune youth" – a new term coined by Mayo researchers to explain a young immune system in someone over age 60.</p>

<p>"We are studying why some individuals have a 'fountain of youth' in their immune systems. We want to learn from them," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/weyand-cornelia-m-m-d-ph-d/bio-20527870" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornelia Weyand, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic rheumatologist and clinician-scientist. She is a lead author on a perspective paper published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-025-00919-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nature Aging</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Weyand's research team discovered this cellular fountain of youth in more than 100 older patients who came to Mayo Clinic to receive treatment for an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/rheumatology/sections/overview/ovc-20477132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune disease</a> that affects the arteries, including the aorta, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/giant-cell-arteritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372758" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant cell arteritis</a>. Dr. Weyand and colleagues found in the diseased tissue of these patients specialized immune cells, called stem-like T cells. These immune cells behave like young stem cells that usually regenerate and aid healing and growth; but in this case, they were spreading the disease. This team of researchers also discovered <a href="https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/scitranslmed.adh0380?af=R" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">autoimmune stem cells</a> in humans previously.</p>



<p>"We observed that these patients have very young immune systems despite being in their 60s and 70s. But the price they pay for that is autoimmunity," she says.</p>



<p>Autoimmunity is when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissues and organs.</p>



<p>In addition, the researchers saw that the immune checkpoint inhibitors that regulate the immune system were not working properly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Benefits of immune system aging</strong></h2>



<p>"Contrary to what one may think, there are benefits to having an immune system that ages in tandem with the body," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/goronzy-jorg-m-d-ph-d/bio-20527076" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jörg Goronzy, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic researcher on aging who is a co-lead author of the paper. "We need to consider the price to pay for immune youthfulness. That price can be autoimmune disease."</p>



<p>Immune aging is a sophisticated adaptation mechanism that the immune system can use to prevent autoimmune disease, say the researchers.</p>



<p>They are in the process of developing new diagnostic tests that will help find patients and healthy individuals who carry high numbers of immune stem cells and may be predisposed to autoimmune disease later in life. The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions.</p>

<p>Led by senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/trushina-eugenia-ph-d/bio-00027310" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eugenia Trushina, Ph.D.</a>, the Mayo Clinic team found that disruptions in complex I activity can trigger gene expression patterns commonly observed in Alzheimer's disease. The researchers demonstrated that using small molecules to gently adjust how complex I functions can help activate protective mechanisms in brain cells.</p>



<p>"This research offers new clues about how Alzheimer’s begins and shows a promising new path for developing better, more personalized treatments," says Dr. Trushina, a researcher who studies neurodegenerative diseases.</p>



<p>Mitochondria, often described as the powerhouse of the cell, produces the energy necessary for proper cellular function. In neurons, which have especially high energy demands, mitochondrial dysfunction can have devastating consequences. The Mayo Clinic researchers found that when complex I is not working properly, it disrupts how brain cells manage energy and respond to stress — changes that resemble those seen in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease.</p>



<p>Using experimental models and advanced molecular and computational tools, the team showed that mild modulation of complex I activity with specially designed small molecules helped neurons launch protective responses, such as reducing inflammation and improving energy balance.</p>



<p>Interestingly, they found that males and females responded differently to these treatments, suggesting a need for sex-specific approaches to therapy. "This sex-dependent effect is intriguing," says Dr. Trushina. "It suggests that future therapies could be tailored by sex, especially for a disease like Alzheimer's that affects men and women differently."</p>



<p>Current Alzheimer's treatments mostly focus on managing symptoms or targeting hallmark brain changes such as amyloid plaques and tau tangles. However, these approaches have seen limited success in halting disease progression. The new study points to mitochondrial dysfunction as a possible upstream trigger — one that may begin long before cognitive symptoms emerge.</p>



<p>"This study gives us a deeper understanding of the cellular events that spark Alzheimer's and, more importantly, how we might intervene to slow or prevent its progression," says Dr. Trushina. "Our results open the door to a new class of drugs that work by protecting the brain's energy supply and buffering it against early disease-related changes."</p>



<p>The research is part of a larger effort at Mayo Clinic called the Precure initiative, focused on developing tools that empower clinicians to predict and intercept biological processes before they evolve into disease or progress into complex, hard-to-treat conditions. In the future, the team plans to further investigate the safety and effectiveness of complex I modulators in preclinical models, with the goal of advancing into clinical trials.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — Scientific breakthroughs in one disease don't always shed light on treating other diseases. But that's been the surprising journey of one <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> research team. After identifying a sugar molecule that cancer cells use on their surfaces to hide from the immune system, the researchers have found the same molecule may eventually help in the treatment of type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Type 1 diabetes</a> is a chronic autoimmune condition in which the immune system errantly attacks pancreatic beta cells that produce insulin. The disease is caused by genetic and other factors and affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the U.S.</p>



<p>In their studies, the Mayo Clinic researchers took a cancer mechanism and turned it on its head. Cancer cells use a variety of methods to evade immune response, including coating themselves in a sugar molecule known as sialic acid. The researchers found in a preclinical model of type 1 diabetes that it's possible to dress up beta cells with the same sugar molecule, enabling the immune system to tolerate the cells.</p>

<p>"Our findings show that it's possible to engineer beta cells that do not prompt an immune response," says immunology researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/shapiro-virginia-m-ph-d/bio-00097048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia Shapiro, Ph.D.</a>, principal investigator of the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/181207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, published&nbsp;in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.</p>



<p>A few years ago, Dr. Shapiro's team demonstrated that an enzyme, known as ST8Sia6, that increases sialic acid on the surface of tumor cells helps tumor cells appear as though they are not foreign entities to be targeted by the immune system. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"The expression of this enzyme basically ‘sugar coats' cancer cells and can help protect an abnormal cell from a normal immune response. We wondered if the same enzyme might also protect a normal cell from an abnormal immune response," Dr. Shapiro says. The team <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jimmunol/article/204/12/3071/7944033?searchresult=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first established</a> proof of concept in an artificially-induced model of diabetes.</p>



<p>In the current study, the team looked at preclinical models that are known for the spontaneous development of autoimmune (type 1) diabetes, most closely approximating the process that occurs in patients. Researchers engineered beta cells in the models to produce the ST8Sia6 enzyme.</p>



<p>In the preclinical models, the team found that the engineered cells were 90% effective in preventing the development of type 1 diabetes. The beta cells that are typically destroyed by the immune system in type 1 diabetes were preserved.</p>

<p>Importantly, the researchers also found the immune response to the engineered cells appears to be highly specific, says M.D.-Ph.D. student Justin Choe, first author of the publication. Choe conducted the study in the Ph.D. component of his dual degree at <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/biomedical-research-training/medical-scientist-training-program-md-phd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences</a> and <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/mayo-clinic-alix-school-of-medicine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine</a>.</p>



<p>"Though the beta cells were spared, the immune system remained intact," Choe says. The researchers were able to see active B- and T-cells and evidence of an autoimmune response against another disease process. "We found that the enzyme specifically generated tolerance against autoimmune rejection of the beta cell, providing local and quite specific protection against type 1 diabetes."</p>



<p>No cure currently exists for type 1 diabetes, and treatment involves using synthetic insulin to regulate blood sugar, or, for some people, undergoing a transplant of pancreatic islet cells, which include the much-needed beta cells. Because transplantation involves immunosuppression of the entire immune system, Dr. Shapiro aims to explore using the engineered beta cells in transplantable islet cells with the goal of ultimately improving therapy for patients.</p>



<p>"A goal would be to provide transplantable cells without the need for immunosuppression," says Dr. Shapiro. "Though we're still in the early stages, this study may be one step toward improving care."</p>



<p>The research was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p><em>Researchers are leading the nation in using powerful and precise radioactive drugs to treat people with complex cancers. &amp;nbsp;</em></p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> has treated the first person in the U.S. using a novel radioactive medicine for advanced breast cancer as part of an international multisite <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT06590857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical trial</a>.</p>



<p>The medicine used in this clinical trial contains actinium-225, a highly potent alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy that was first developed for a subtype of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, which are rare and can form in the pancreas and the gastrointestinal tract. The alpha-emitting radiopharmaceutical therapy is intended to work by passing through the blood to stick to cancer cells, delivering powerful and precise radiation without harming healthy cells.</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic researchers are the first to apply this therapy in America to a patient with metastatic breast cancer. The phase 1b/2 open-label trial is being conducted at all three academic Mayo Clinic sites in Rochester, Minnesota; Phoenix; Jacksonville, Florida; and approximately 20 other sites across the U.S. The first person treated was at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>

<p>The principal investigator at Mayo Clinic is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/johnson-geoffrey-b-m-d-ph-d/bio-20055408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoffrey Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a professor of radiology and a leader in radiopharmaceutical therapies. He says these are innovative cancer treatments that use radioactive medicines designed to target and kill cancer cells with high precision.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic has nearly 20 active radiopharmaceutical therapy clinical trials, with 10 more preparing to launch, targeting many different types of cancer. Mayo Clinic in Rochester treats more patients with modern radiopharmaceutical therapies, such as lutetium dotatate for neuroendocrine cancers and lutetium PSMA for prostate cancers, than any other center in the world.</p>



<p>Lutetium dotatate and lutetium PSMA are beta-emitting radiopharmaceuticals. They use beta particles, which are tiny subatomic particles, to radiate at a low level. In contrast, alpha-emitting radiopharmaceuticals use alpha particles that are 8,000 times more massive than beta particles, and travel only three cell diameters after they are emitted from the therapy.</p>



<p>"This means alpha emitters can deliver a much more powerful impact over a shorter distance. If you consider killing a cancer cell is like knocking down a brick wall, then the difference is like throwing a 10-pound dumbbell (beta) at the wall versus a fully loaded Mack truck (alpha)," says Dr. Johnson. "The alpha emitter's potential lies in its power and in its ability to precisely kill even a single cancer cell without injuring surrounding healthy tissue, making it a next-generation therapy."</p>



<p>In <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.233408" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preclinical studies</a>, data indicates actinium-225 DOTATATE that targets the somatostatin receptor subtype 2expression demonstrated feasibility and potential efficacy for treatment of ER+ metastatic breast cancer in the laboratory. The drug was developed by RayzeBio Inc., a Bristol Myers Squibb Company, the sponsor of the active phase 1b/2 clinical trial.</p>

<div style="height:25px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Deep inside the body, a slow-growing cluster of mutated blood cells can form. This cluster, found in 1 in 5 older adults, can raise the risk of leukemia and heart disease, often without warning.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>To better understand this hidden risk, Mayo Clinic researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) tool to help investigators uncover how it contributes to disease risk and progression. </p>



<p>In a study <a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fgpb%2Fadvance-article%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fgpbjnl%2Fqzaf040%2F8121950&amp;amp;data=05%7C02%7CMurphy.Susan%40mayo.edu%7C05f57239f813422ca87008ddc97a7be3%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638888250101337358%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;amp;sdata=EEqrric0Eslg1ajqpP60TW69EXgCPyIzcLJp5GRxa4Q%3D&amp;amp;reserved=0">published</a> in Genomics, Proteomics &amp;amp; Bioinformatics, the tool showed promising results in identifying early signs of this condition, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/clonal-hematopoiesis-clinic-stratifies-risk-for-patients-with-cancer/mac-20543180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential</a>, or CHIP.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When blood cells mutate</strong></h2>



<p>CHIP starts in the bone marrow, where blood stem cells make the cells that keep organs working, oxygen flowing and the immune system strong. But if one of those cells acquires a mutation in a gene linked to blood cancer, it can multiply abnormally, forming a cluster of mutated cells that gradually expands.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This can cause CHIP, a condition with no symptoms that researchers link to higher rates of death, especially from heart disease. Because its effects vary, CHIP is hard to track and often goes undetected for years.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>CHIP makes leukemia more than 10 times more likely and raises the risk of heart disease up to four times, even in healthy adults. Finding it earlier could help guide proactive monitoring or preventive care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A new tool for early detection</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>The new tool, called UNISOM — short for UNIfied SOmatic calling and Machine learning — was developed by <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/tian-shulan-ph-d-m-s/bio-20524328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shulan Tian, Ph.D.</a>, under the leadership of <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/klee-eric-w-ph-d/bio-00077293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eric Klee, Ph.D.</a>, co-senior author of the study and the Everett J. and Jane M. Hauck Midwest Associate Director of Research and Innovation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>UNISOM helps clinicians identify CHIP-related mutations in standard genetic datasets, opening new avenues for research and discovery. In the past, that level of detection required more complex and advanced sequencing methods.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Detecting disease at its earliest molecular roots is one of the most meaningful advances we can make in medicine," says Dr. Klee. "UNISOM is just one of many examples of how we're translating genomic science into innovative tools that support timely and informed care."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>UNISOM helped researchers detect nearly 80% of CHIP mutations using whole-exome sequencing, which analyzes the protein-coding regions of DNA.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The team also tested UNISOM on whole-genome sequencing data from the Mayo Clinic Biobank, which captures nearly all of a person's genetic code. In that data, it detected early signs of CHIP, including mutations present in fewer than 5% of blood cells. Standard techniques often miss these small but important changes.</p>



<p>"We're engineering a path from genomic discovery to clinical decision-making," says Dr. Tian, the co-senior author and a bioinformatician at Mayo Clinic. "It's rewarding to help bring these discoveries closer to clinical care, where they can inform decisions and support more precise treatment."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Next, the team plans to apply UNISOM to larger and more diverse datasets to support research and expand its use in clinical practice.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>For nearly <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34437305/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">three decades</a>, Mayo Clinic researcher <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/evans-christopher-h-ph-d/bio-20086893" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Christopher Evans, Ph.D.</a>, has pushed to expand gene therapy beyond its original scope of fixing rare, single-gene defects. That has meant systematically advancing the field through laboratory experiments, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.</p>



<p>Several gene therapies have already received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and experts predict that <a href="https://newdigs.tuftsmedicalcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NEWDIGS-Research-Brief-2020F207v51-PipelineAnalysis.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">40 to 60 more</a> could be approved over the next decade for a range of conditions. Dr. Evans hopes a gene therapy for osteoarthritis — a form of arthritis affecting more than <a href="https://oaaction.unc.edu/oa-module/oa-prevalence-and-burden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">32.5 million</a> U.S. adults — will be one of them.</p>



<p>Recently, Dr. Evans and a team of 18 researchers and clinicians reported the results of a first-in-human, phase 1 clinical trial of a novel gene therapy for osteoarthritis. The findings, published in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40465688/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Science Translational Advances</a>, demonstrated that the therapy is safe, achieved sustained expression of a therapeutic gene inside the joint and offered early evidence of clinical benefit.</p>



<p>"This could revolutionize the treatment of osteoarthritis," says Dr. Evans, who directs the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/musculoskeletal-gene-therapy-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musculoskeletal Gene Therapy Research</a> lab at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/osteoarthritis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">osteoarthritis</a>, the cartilage that cushions the ends of bones — and sometimes the underlying bone itself — degenerates over time. It is a leading cause of disability, and notoriously difficult to treat. "Any medications you inject into the affected joint will seep right back out in a few hours," says Dr. Evans. "As far as I know, gene therapy is the only reasonable way to overcome this pharmacologic barrier, and it's a huge barrier." By genetically modifying cells in the joint to produce their own pharmacy of anti-inflammatory molecules, Evans aims to engineer knees that are more resistant to arthritis.</p>



<p>The Evans laboratory found that a molecule called interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays an important role in fueling inflammation, pain and cartilage loss in osteoarthritis. As luck would have it, the molecule had a natural inhibitor, aptly named the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), that could form the basis of the first gene therapy for the disease. In 2000, Dr. Evans and his team <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10853185/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">packaged the IL-1Ra gene into a harmless virus called AAV</a>, which they tested in cells and then pre-clinical models. The results were encouraging.</p>



<p>In pre-clinical testing, his collaborators at the University of Florida demonstrated that the gene therapy successfully infiltrated the cells that make up the synovial lining of the joint as well as the neighboring cartilage. The therapy <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11850718/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protected the cartilage</a> from breakdown. In 2015, the team got investigational new drug approval to start human testing. But regulatory hurdles and manufacturing challenges kept them from injecting their first patient for another four years. Mayo Clinic has since established a&nbsp;new process for accelerating clinical trial&nbsp;activation that could help researchers launch studies more quickly.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40465688/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent study</a>, Dr. Evans and his team gave the experimental gene therapy to nine patients with osteoarthritis, delivering it directly into the knee joint. They found that the levels of the anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra increased and remained elevated in the joint for at least a year. Participants also reported reduced pain and improved joint function, with no serious safety issues. Dr. Evans says the findings suggest the treatment is safe and may offer long-lasting relief from osteoarthritis symptoms. "This study provides a highly promising, novel way to attack the disease," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Evans has co-founded an arthritis gene therapy company called <a href="https://genascence.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genascence </a>to drive the project forward. The company just completed a larger phase Ib study and is in discussions with the FDA about launching a pivotal phase IIb/III clinical trial&nbsp;to evaluate the therapy's effectiveness, the next step before FDA approval for the therapy.</p>



<p>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40465688/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>&nbsp;for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Our aspiration for AI is to meaningfully improve patient outcomes by detecting disease early enough to intervene. What was once a hypothetical — 'If only we had the right data' — is now becoming reality thanks to AI and advanced computing," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/callstrom-matthew-r-m-d-ph-d/bio-00085927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matthew Callstrom, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, medical director of the Department of Strategy and leader of Mayo Clinic’s Generative Artificial Intelligence Program.</p>



<p>The advanced computing infrastructure will initially support foundation model development for pathomics, drug discovery and precision medicine.</p>



<p>The NVIDIA Blackwell-powered <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-b200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DGX SuperPOD</a> is built to efficiently process large, high-resolution imaging essential for AI foundation model training. Designed for speed and scalability, the Blackwell infrastructure enables Mayo Clinic to accelerate pathology slide analysis and foundation model development — reducing four weeks of work to just one, ultimately improving patient outcomes. This advanced computing infrastructure will also advance Mayo Clinic’s generative AI and multimodal digital pathology foundation model development.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have discovered a key reason some cancer patients relapse after receiving chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/car-t-cell-therapy/about/pac-20585020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CAR-T cell therapy</a>. Over time, the engineered immune cells age and lose their ability to fight cancer. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://molecular-cancer.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12943-025-02371-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Published</a> in Molecular Cancer, the study identifies this aging process, known as senescence, as a previously unrecognized mechanism of CAR-T failure.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers also showed that senescence is influenced by how CAR-T cells are engineered. Certain intracellular features — such as how the cell recognizes cancer and how strongly it activates — can overwork the cells. The researchers found that if the activation signal is too intense or prolonged, it can push CAR-T cells into premature aging. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The discovery may guide the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies that last longer and are more effective across a broader range of cancers. &amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"This is one of the most clinically relevant discoveries we've made because it doesn't just explain the cause of relapse, it gives us a biological target to possibly prevent it," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/kenderian-saad-j-m-b-ch-b/bio-20206512" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Saad Kenderian, M.B., Ch.B.</a>, a principal investigator and hematologist at Mayo Clinic. &nbsp;</p>



<p>CAR-T therapy reprograms a patient's own immune cells to recognize and destroy cancer. It has led to long-term remission for patients, including some with aggressive or treatment-resistant diseases. But many patients eventually relapse, and the causes have remained poorly understood.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Modeling CAR-T cell stress over time</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>To investigate why CAR-T therapy can fail, the Mayo team developed a novel lab model that simulates long-term biological stress, offering a clearer view of how the engineered cells behave after infusion. Over time, some CAR-T cells lost their ability to multiply and attack cancer. Specifically, they showed hallmark signs of senescence, including distinct genetic changes. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The researchers found that senescence occurred more often in CAR-T cells built with a signaling feature, known as 4-1BB, which affects how the cells respond to cancer. In comparison, cells designed with an alternative domain, called CD28, were less affected by aging. These cells activate more quickly and persist for a shorter time, reducing the cumulative stress that drives senescence. </p>



<p>The researchers confirmed the results in multiple laboratory models and validated them in patient samples.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Engineering CAR-T cells for longevity</strong>&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>That discovery was driven in part by the work of Ismail Can, Ph.D., who helped lead the molecular analysis behind the finding.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p>"Efforts to make CAR-T cell therapy more durable will likely fail without fully understanding the reasons behind CAR-T cell failure. This study represents a significant step toward understanding why CAR-T cells fail," says Dr. Can, first author of the study and a senior research fellow at Mayo Clinic’s T&amp;nbsp;Cell Engineering Laboratory. "By identifying the early molecular triggers of senescence, we can begin to refine CAR-T design to potentially improve long-term function and reduce relapse."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The findings highlight a new direction for CAR-T research, with potential implications not only for blood cancers but also for expanding cell therapy into solid tumors. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The study builds on Dr. Kenderian's broader efforts to identify resistance mechanisms and design more durable and personalized immunotherapies. &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>

In its inaugural year, three scholars were accepted into the unique Nursing Research Scholar program. Under the guidance of nurse scientists in the Division of Nursing Research, the Nursing Research Scholars are Ph.D.-prepared nurses who will now dedicate one day a week to research that improves patient care.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center"><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="768" height="820" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/res-research-model-1-1-768x820-1.png" alt="Nursing research graphic" class="wp-image-404731 size-full" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/res-research-model-1-1-768x820-1.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/07/res-research-model-1-1-768x820-1-281x300.png 281w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px" /></figure><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">

<p>Research at Mayo Clinic begins with the unmet needs of the patient. As a patient or a loved one, you want to be sure you are receiving the best care from the best-trained staff who follow evidence-based care. Nurses provide direct care to patients daily, so they know which approaches work well and which need adjusting. A key characteristic of an effective practitioner is the ability to evaluate standard procedures and identify opportunities for improvement. The concept of refining nursing practices and procedures is at the heart of nursing research.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>Education and training are ongoing in medicine, and nurses are frequently tasked with updating their knowledge.&amp;nbsp;Amanda Rossley, Ph.D.,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;nurse manager in nursing professional development, hopes to study the latest in training pedagogy by using gamification to improve learning among nurses. “Gaming is an active learning strategy that improves concentration, creativity, memory and engagement,” she says.&amp;nbsp;She hopes her research will contribute to data-driven insights that lead to the practical translation for gamification-based nursing and patient education that improves patient care. For patients, this means the possibility of playing a game to learn more about managing conditions, instead of reading about it.</p>



<p>The clinical performance of a nursing student is influenced by their mental health, social support, the learning environment and self-efficacy, or the belief in one's capacity to perform.&amp;nbsp;Jeanine Gangeness, Ph.D.,&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;program director in Nursing Academic Affairs, is on a mission to enhance the existing training environment for nursing students by pinpointing which interventions increase student self-efficacy and sense of belonging. “This research is an investment in the future workforce of Mayo Clinic,” she explains. “Nursing students with high self-efficacy are more likely to work hard, complete their tasks and be more resilient in the face of failures, leading to better patient outcomes and more competent and confident nurses.”</p>



<p>For patients with adverse symptoms, relief cannot come soon enough. Despite monumental advances in medical practice and technology, many questions remain regarding symptom management in complex patients.&amp;nbsp;Savannah Zins, Ph.D.,&amp;nbsp;a nursing education specialist in nursing professional development, says, “Understanding the biological and behavioral aspects of adverse symptoms through symptom science can improve patients’ quality of life, reduce chronic symptoms and burden, and lower healthcare costs.” Through her research, Zins hopes to identify non-pharmacologic and nursing interventions to make patients more comfortable.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Because Mayo Clinic is highly collaborative, discoveries from one area are quickly translated to other areas. Within this scholarly environment, staff at Mayo continually seek new medical knowledge and ways to rapidly and responsibly validate and apply it. The Nursing Research Scholar program is one example of how the organization empowers nurses to integrate their clinical expertise with guided research opportunities, applying their findings to drive change. These research initiatives will have a positive impact, enabling the organization to share discoveries that lead to improved healthcare beyond its walls.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn.&amp;nbsp;— A team of Mayo Clinic researchers has developed an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can detect surgical site infections (SSIs) with high accuracy from patient-submitted postoperative wound photos, potentially transforming how postoperative care is delivered.</p>



<p>Published in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://journals.lww.com/annalsofsurgery/abstract/9900/imaging_based_surgical_site_infection_detection.1357.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Annals of Surgery</a>, the study introduces an AI-based pipeline the researchers created that can automatically identify surgical incisions, assess image quality and flag signs of infection in photos submitted by patients through online portals. The system was trained on over 20,000 images from more than 6,000 patients across nine Mayo Clinic hospitals.<br><br>"We were motivated by the increasing need for outpatient monitoring of surgical incisions in a timely manner," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/thiels-cornelius-a-d-o-m-b-a/bio-20519744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cornelius Thiels, D.O.</a>, a hepatobiliary and pancreatic surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic and co-senior author of the study. "This process, currently done by clinicians, is time-consuming and can delay care. Our AI model can help triage these images automatically, improving early detection and streamlining communication between patients and their care teams."</p>



<p>The AI system uses a two-stage model. First, it detects whether an image contains a surgical incision and then evaluates whether that incision shows signs of infection. The model, Vision Transformer, achieved a 94% accuracy in detecting incisions and an 81% area under the curve (AUC) in identifying infections.</p>



<p></p>

<p>"This work lays the foundation for AI-assisted postoperative wound care, which can transform how postoperative patients are monitored," says Hala Muaddi, M.D., Ph.D., a hepatopancreatobiliary fellow at Mayo Clinic and first author. "It’s especially relevant as outpatient operations and virtual follow-ups become more common."</p>
</div></div>



<p></p>



<p>The researchers are hopeful that this technology could help patients receive faster responses, reduce delays in diagnosing infections and support better care for those recovering from surgery at home. With further validation, it could function as a frontline screening tool that alerts clinicians to concerning incisions. This AI tool also paves the way for developing algorithms capable of detecting subtle signs of infection, potentially before they become visually apparent to the care team. This would allow for earlier treatment, decreased morbidity and reduced costs.</p>



<p>"For patients, this could mean faster reassurance or earlier identification of a problem," says Dr. Muaddi. "For clinicians, it offers a way to prioritize attention to cases that need it most, especially in rural or resource-limited settings."</p>



<p>Importantly, the model demonstrated consistent performance across diverse groups, addressing concerns about algorithmic bias.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>While the results are promising, the team says that further validation is needed.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Our hope is that the AI models we developed — and the large dataset they were trained on — have the potential to fundamentally reshape how surgical follow-up is delivered," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/salehinejad-hojjat-ph-d/bio-20547448" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hojjat Salehinejad, Ph.D.</a>, a senior associate consultant of health care delivery research within the Kern Center for the Science of Health Care Delivery and co-senior author. "Prospective studies are underway to evaluate how well this tool integrates into day-to-day surgical care."</p>



<p>This research was supported by the Dalio Philanthropies Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Enablement Award and the Simons Family Career Development Award in Surgical Innovation.</p>
