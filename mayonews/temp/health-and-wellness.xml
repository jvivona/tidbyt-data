<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Recently, I was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-does-it-mean-to-have-an-enlarged-prostate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BPH</a>. This is all new to me, and I hope you can help me better understand the condition and how it's treated.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>Now that you've been diagnosed with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20370087?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)</a> — noncancerous tissue growth within the prostate — it's time for you and your healthcare team to talk about treatment options.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These options depend on the severity of your symptoms, which can range from having a weak urine stream to not being able to urinate at all. Most treatments are done in the outpatient setting, including your clinician's office, while others may require a hospital stay. Wherever you are on the range of symptoms, there are treatment options that can relieve them, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-prostate-and-one-with-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-BPH-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a normal prostate and one with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)" class="wp-image-221033" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-prostate-and-one-with-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-BPH-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-prostate-and-one-with-benign-prostatic-hyperplasia-BPH-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A medical illustration of a normal prostate and one with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Behavior modifications</strong></h2>



<p>If you're experiencing bothersome, but not severe, symptoms, such as having a weak urine stream or frequently getting up at night to urinate, your treatment may start with:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Changes to your diet</strong><br>Some foods, such as chocolate, citrus, carbonated beverages and caffeine, can irritate your bladder, which can increase your urge to urinate. Cutting back on these foods may ease your symptoms.</li>



<li><strong>Fluid intake</strong><br>Reducing the amount of fluid you drink before bedtime can decrease your need to urinate during the night.</li>



<li><strong>Timed urination (voiding)</strong><br>Holding your urine can also irritate your bladder, so making a point to urinate every hour and a half to two hours can reduce the urge to go "now."</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Medications for BPH</strong></h2>



<p>If these behavior modifications are no longer effective, your clinician may prescribe a medication, which you'll need to take every day. These include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Alpha blockers</strong><br>These drugs relax muscles in the bladder and prostate, and they open up the urinary channel to reduce blockage. Side effects include a decrease in blood pressure, dizziness and lightheadedness. They also can cause semen to go back into the bladder instead of the penis, which may be startling, but is harmless.</li>



<li><strong>5-alpha reductase inhibitors</strong><br>These medications work to shrink the prostate by lowering the production of a specific hormone. There are more side effects, and it may take six to nine months to see any results. Men may have a lower sex drive, and some will experience erectile dysfunction.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Surgical procedures</strong></h2>



<p>You and your healthcare team may decide that in-office therapies or surgery to shrink or remove overgrown prostate tissue would be the best treatment option for you. Some treatments work better than others, depending on your symptoms, treatment goals and the size of your prostate. Most preserve sexual function and have little or no effect on erectile or ejaculatory function.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These treatments include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Temporarily implanted nitinol device</strong><br>This procedure reshapes the tissue of the prostatic urethra and the bladder neck to create a wider channel through which urine can flow. A narrow, folded nickel titanium device is inserted into the prostatic urethra. As the device expands, gentle pressure reshapes the urethra and bladder opening. After five to seven days, the device is removed.</li>



<li><strong>Prostatic urethral lift (PUL)</strong><br>This procedure reshapes the prostate using a small, permanent implant to compress and lift the side of the enlarged prostate to increase the urethra opening.</li>



<li><strong>Steam therapy</strong><br>During the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-steam-treatment-for-enlarged-prostate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a>, a tiny needle is inserted into the urethra and positioned in the prostate gland. In nine seconds, the needle produces a 2-centimeter-wide steam ball that shrinks the surrounding prostate tissue.</li>



<li><strong>Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) and photo-selective vaporization (PVP)</strong><br>During a TURP, a lighted scope is inserted into the urethra and the surgeon uses an electric loop to remove all but the outer part of the prostate. TURP generally relieves symptoms quickly, and most men have a stronger urine flow soon after the procedure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>PVP is laser therapy performed in an operating room under anesthesia. A surgeon inserts a thin, tube-like instrument into the urethra. This instrument has a lens, light and tool that sends out an electrical current to destroy prostate tissue. Heat from the current seals small blood vessels, reducing the risk of bleeding. This procedure destroys or removes overgrown prostate tissue and is a good choice if you need to stay on blood thinners.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Prostate enucleation (<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/treatment-for-enlarged-prostate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BipoLEP</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/laser-based-prostate-procedure-treats-bph" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>HoLEP</strong></a><strong>)</strong><br>This procedure removes nearly the entire prostate without an incision. It is often a good option for patients with especially large prostates, the inability to stop blood thinners or in significant urinary retention. A thin instrument is inserted into the urethra. Then, a laser cuts the prostate tissue into small, removable pieces.&nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Simple prostatectomy</strong><br>This minimally invasive surgery removes tissue blocking the flow of urine. It usually requires a one-night stay in the hospital and is done laparoscopically through a small incision in your side, most often using a surgical robot.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Cory and his family, it is a gift to be able to give back in a meaningful way and bring joy to young patients currently fighting their own health battles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is a full circle moment for Cory Simonson, who now owns and manages the Squeegee Squad in Rochester, and his son, Carter Simonson.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Erin Barreto, a pharmacist, reflects on years of infertility, resilience, healing and the joy of welcoming two children through IVF.</strong></strong></p>



<p>"It was a long, uncertain road filled with setbacks around every corner. When you had those moments of hope, you had to hang on to them."</p>



<p>Erin Barreto, Pharm.D.,&nbsp;Ph.D.,&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic pharmacist and now mom of two, spent nearly seven years navigating the complex path of infertility with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/reproductive-endocrinology-and-infertility-in-minnesota/overview/ovc-20424328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility</a>&nbsp;team at Mayo Clinic in Rochester. The team, comprised of approximately 80 staff members, was recently ranked in the top 10 in Newsweek's "<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-in-rochester-team-ranked-among-americas-best-fertility-clinics-by-newsweek/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">America's Best Fertility Clinics</a>" for the third year in a row.&nbsp;In the last five years, the division has helped welcome more than 1,000 babies into the world.</p>



<p>Erin chose Mayo Clinic because she trusted the data, believed in the success rates and knew that having access to top professionals delivering state-of-the-art care with compassion and empathy could offer hope when it was in short supply.</p>



<p>Though the journey included moments of loss, waiting and resilience, she and her husband,&nbsp;Jason (Jay) Barreto, Pharm.D., held onto the possibility of growing their family.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along the way, they had a chance to connect with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ainsworth-ali-j-m-d/bio-20515930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ali Ainsworth, M.D</a>.,&nbsp;the clinical director of in vitro fertilization in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Dr. A saw us through it all&nbsp;—&nbsp;miracles and miscarriages," Erin said. "She knew how to advise us because she took the time to get to know us."</p>



<p>"I’m humbled to hear that," says Dr. Ainsworth. "Being part of Erin and Jay's story is a privilege I don't take lightly. Our work is so meaningful&nbsp;—&nbsp;hard and heartbreaking and meaningful."&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A journey marked by care and connections</strong></h2>



<p>Erin's journey through infertility opened her eyes not only to the medical demands of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/in-vitro-fertilization/about/pac-20384716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in vitro fertilization (IVF)</a> but also to the emotional toll it takes. She found grounding in small rituals like wearing a special pair of wool socks to every egg retrieval, a procedure in the IVF process where mature eggs are collected from the ovaries using a thin needle guided by ultrasound.</p>



<p>Funded by a past Joy Project, the socks carried&nbsp;hopeful messages:&nbsp;<em>IVF got hope. Lucky transfer socks.</em></p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Erins-wollen-socks-hope-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Erin Barreto shared her infertility journey with Mayo Clinic. She wore wollen socks of hope." class="wp-image-402961" style="width:565px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Erins-wollen-socks-hope-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Erins-wollen-socks-hope-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Erins-wollen-socks-hope-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Erins-wollen-socks-hope-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/05/Erins-wollen-socks-hope-16-x-9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Erin's special wool socks </figcaption></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>Erin remembers putting the socks on before each egg retrieval, channeling all the good energy she could muster.</p>



<p>Support came from people, too — Mayo staff who cared for her not just as a patient, but as a person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maria Lujero, a nurse in Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility, held Erin's hand during her very first retrieval when she was scared and overwhelmed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"She was a relieving force. I will never forget it," Erin says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Chelsea Marquardt&nbsp;was a new nurse when Erin started her journey and helped her with medication counseling. This is an important part of the IVF process because the treatment involves complex, time-sensitive medications that patients often administer themselves.</p>



<p>"Chelsea has been a constant support the whole time. While I am a pharmacist, I wanted in that moment to be a patient, to trust that someone would help walk me through things." says Erin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Their connection, rooted in that early guidance and nurtured over time, reflects the kind of enduring support that shaped Erin's experience.</p>



<p>Mayo's shift toward a more holistic approach to care also made a difference for Erin, reinforcing her confidence in Mayo Clinic and her care team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Erin joined the&nbsp;Mind Body Fertility program&nbsp;led by&nbsp;Nicole Callahan, a nurse practitioner, where participants gathered to talk about the emotional side of fertility treatment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"I was further along in my journey when I joined the program, so it felt healing to give back and support others who were just beginning theirs," Erin says." It was rewarding to be a source of hope."</p>



<p><a>"</a>We know that fertility treatment is more than just a medical process — it touches every part of a person's life," says Dr. Ainsworth. "Programs like Mind Body Fertility reflect our commitment to whole-person care. It's validating to know that patients like Erin have found benefit and support."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Lessons in resilience</strong></h2>



<p>There were hard lessons, too. Learning how to self-advocate came later to Erin than she wished. One especially painful experience involved hearing sensitive news in a clinical way, before she was ready and before Jay could be with her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In many care settings, results are often shared routinely — sometimes through the patient portal or in straightforward conversations. But over time, Erin realized she needed something more personal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Seeing the Mayo number on my phone on days we were expecting test results was especially triggering. I would think to myself, 'They only call when it's something bad that they don't want to send through the portal.'"</p>



<p>"We talked to the care team and made a new plan. Jay would receive the call and gently share whatever news with me at a time that was right. That way, it wasn't one more thing for me to carry. I wasn't forever having to receive and transmit the news that was so often disappointing. I wish I had realized I needed that sooner."</p>



<p>This small change made a meaningful difference for both Erin and Jay. "Being met with compassion in those vulnerable moments changed how we carried the experience," she said.</p>



<p>Her advice to others considering IVF is heartfelt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Be hopeful," she says. "Be excited. Find people who understand what you're going through. Build a support system, even if it's small."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The joy that waited</strong></h2>



<p>After three transfers&nbsp;—&nbsp;the final step in the IVF process, where one or more fertilized embryos are carefully placed into the uterus in hopes of achieving a pregnancy&nbsp;—&nbsp;Erin and Jay finally welcomed their first child, a daughter born during the pandemic. Later, after more heartbreak, their second child arrived. They named them Charlotte and Thomas.</p>

</figcaption></figure>



<p>Charlotte, now four, embraces her new role as big sister with delight.</p>



<p>"She calls him her 'baby guy,'" Erin smiles. "She'll say to him, 'Hi, it's Big Sis!' and it's the most magical thing."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thomas, just four months old, is beginning to smile, and hints of his personality are already starting to shine through. Erin is soaking in every moment.</p>



<p>"Having my children is the greatest blessing," she says. "In this phase of life, it's about sitting on the floor, doing puzzles and hearing my kids laugh. That's the best part. That's what we were waiting for."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>We live in a rural area about 40 minutes from our health system's nearest clinic. However, they do offer the option to meet virtually with our healthcare team members. We'd like to try <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/harnessing-telehealth-to-enhance-patient-care/">virtual care</a>. Could you tell us more about it?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>Whether you live in a rural or urban community, virtual care can be a great choice for connecting with healthcare. You can save drive time, avoid bad weather and stay home when it's best not to be in a clinic where you could infect others.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But even better, if your primary care clinic offers video visits (most do), you maintain continuity of care with your healthcare team, whether you're at home or traveling. Any information and care recommendations are entered into your electronic health record.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choose your virtual option</strong></h2>



<p>There are typically three main types of virtual care (also called telemedicine or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/telehealth/art-20044878">telehealth</a>): messaging, video visits to your home, and video visits at a clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Messaging</strong>. You and your healthcare professional exchange information via a secure messaging platform. This can include questions about a condition, medications or follow-up from a previous appointment. Your clinician usually responds within 24 hours or less. Messaging may lead to a video visit or an in-person appointment.</p>



<p><strong>Video visit to your home.</strong>&nbsp;Through your health system's patient portal, you can set up a video appointment with a member of your healthcare team, just as you would an in-person appointment. Just as with an office visit, hearing your story about how something happened, symptoms you're experiencing, medication side effects and more, can help your clinician make an informed diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During a video visit, you can discuss your issue with your clinician, upload photos to give your healthcare team a close-up look at something, like a rash or lump. For example, if your child has an ear infection, there's an inexpensive device you can purchase online that takes a video of the ear canal. With this information, your clinician can recommend care.</p>



<p>Your clinician also may order other services or arrange to have a specialist connect with your visit. You can even invite a family member or friend to join the visit to provide an extra set of ears.</p>



<p>In addition, if you need translation services, they can be arranged when you make your appointment. During the video visit, your clinician, interpreter and you will all be online.</p>



<p><strong>Video visit at the clinic.</strong>&nbsp;Another variation of video visit is making an in-office appointment but then connecting with a specialist online. This is particularly helpful for patients who may not have stable internet connections.</p>



<p><strong>On-demand care.</strong>&nbsp;Your health system may offer other forms of virtual care, such as on-demand care via a mobile app. This service is typically available 24/7 every day, including weekends and holidays. On-demand care can focus on an urgent problem, but you can also schedule an appointment and arrange to receive helpful reminders about prescriptions, lab work, follow-up appointments and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Your in-person and virtual providers collaborate on your care through a shared medical record. However, the level of integration varies widely across healthcare organizations.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>When to consider virtual care</strong></h2>



<p>The list of conditions that can be addressed virtually is a long one, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Upper respiratory Infections, including colds, influenza and COVID-19 (especially now with home diagnostic kits)</li>



<li>Sinusitis</li>



<li>Rashes</li>



<li>Insect bites</li>



<li>Constipation</li>



<li>Mental health conditions</li>



<li>Urinary tract infections (often coupled with a lab test)</li>



<li>Monitoring and adjusting medications for chronic conditions</li>



<li>Follow-up for many chronic conditions, including:<ul><li>Diabetes</li></ul><ul><li>Weight-loss medications</li></ul><ul><li>High blood pressure (if you have a home blood pressure cuff)</li></ul><ul><li>Cholesterol</li></ul>
<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Low thyroid</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>However, if you're having difficulty breathing or chest pains, you should go to the emergency department. If you suspect something is broken or infected, you should also seek in-person care because these conditions tend to require a "hands-on" exam and assessment or direct treatment.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Before, during and after your video visit</strong></h2>



<p>Here are a few tips for a successful video visit:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>When you make your appointment, upload any photos or videos that could give your clinician a close-up view of the problem.</li>



<li>Be sure you have a reliable internet connection.</li>



<li>Arrange for a quiet space for the visit, especially since you'll be sharing protected health information. Having a video visit at a coffee shop or on a public computer may not be a good choice.</li>



<li>Dress comfortably but appropriately.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Make a few notes about what you want to cover with your clinician.</li>



<li>Be sure to ask questions. If someone is joining the visit, let them know they can ask questions, too.</li>



<li>Following your visit, you'll receive an after-visit summary just as you do with an in-person visit. It's typically delivered to your patient portal.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Editors note: May is National Trauma Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>Campfires are a beloved part of summer — whether you're roasting marshmallows, telling stories or just enjoying the warmth. But for families with young children, it's important to be aware of the risk of burns and know how to prevent and respond to such injuries.</p>



<p>"It's almost a part of a life ritual," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/klinkner-denise-b-m-d-m-ed/bio-20153231">Denise Klinkner, M.D.</a>, pediatric trauma center director and pediatric surgeon at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, of social gatherings around a fire. "But approach it diligently to maintain a safe and fun environment."</p>



<p>Dr. Klinkner urges adults and caregivers to remain vigilant and aware, especially regarding the status of the fire and the location of any children.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Risks to watch for around campfires</strong></h2>



<p>Children, particularly toddlers and preschoolers, are naturally curious and still developing coordination. That makes them more likely to trip or move too close to the fire. Because of this, most campfire burns in children happen to the hands and are usually second-degree or even third-degree burns.</p>



<p>Here are some common dangers to watch out for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hot tools and sticks</strong>: Roasting sticks and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ouch-ive-burned-my-hand-on-a-hot-pan-now-what-2/">metal forks</a> can cause burns or even eye injuries if a child grabs or walks into them.</li>



<li><strong>Grease from food</strong>: Dripping grease can flare up flames and cause more severe burns.</li>



<li><strong>Accelerants like lighter fluid</strong>: These can cause explosions when they catch fire or make burns worse if they come into contact with skin. Caregivers should also ensure these items are sealed to avoid accidental consumption by a young child.</li>



<li><strong>Propane fire pits</strong>: While convenient, they can explode if not handled properly.</li>
</ul>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>Burn prevention tips</strong></h2>



<p>You don’t have to give up campfires to stay safe. Dr. Klinkner has these tips:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Keep a safe distance</strong>: Set a clear boundary around the fire that kids know not to cross.</li>



<li><strong>Supervise closely</strong>: Always have an adult watching the fire and the children.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid accelerants</strong>: Never use gasoline or lighter fluid to start or boost a fire.</li>



<li><strong>Teach fire safety</strong>: Show children how to safely enjoy the fire, and for older kids demonstrate what to do in an emergency. Have water or blankets available to stop fires.</li>



<li><strong>Extinguish completely</strong>: Make sure a fire is fully out before leaving or going to bed.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><br><strong>What to do if a burn happens</strong></h2>



<p>Dr. Klinkner encourages you to remember the&nbsp;“stop, drop, and roll” fire safety&nbsp;technique to put out the flames if a child's clothing or skin catches fire. </p>

<p>If a child experiences <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-burns/basics/art-20056649">minor burns or blisters</a>, Dr. Klinkner suggests these steps:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Apply a cool, wet cloth to help cool the burn until the pain eases. Do not use cold water as children's body temperatures can drop quickly.</li>



<li>Apply a clean, dry dressing or bandage loosely around the burn. This blocks airflow over the burn, often a significant source of pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Seek medical help&nbsp;immediately, especially for larger, deeper or more severe burns.</p>



<p>"Enjoy your summer and remember — only you can prevent forest fires, and more importantly, burns to your friends and family," says Dr. Klinkner.</p>

<p>Whether you're a pro or biking for fun, there are common injuries all cyclists might experience.</p>



<p>"The first one is a traumatic injury if somebody falls off a bike," says Dr. Kakar.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Common breaks from traumatic injury include wrist fractures.</p>



<p>"We also see overuse-type injuries. So, for example, we see patients where they're pressing on the brakes for too long, squeezing hard, putting pressure on their palm, and their hands sometimes fall asleep — called numbness and tingling," Dr. Kakar says.</p>



<p>He says it could be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, a condition you don't want to ignore.</p>



<p>"If you have numbness and tingling in the fingers, it is something I wouldn't ignore because if you have carpal tunnel, we worry about that," Dr. Kakar explains. </p>



<p>The numbness and tingling can become permanent and result in the loss of muscle strength</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevent bike injuries</strong></h2>



<p>"There are simple preventive measures you can take," says Dr. Kakar. "Having thicker grips so you're not squeezing as hard can also help. Bike gloves help as well and sometimes puts your wrist in a better position than putting pressure on your palm."</p>

<p>Wildfires in parts of the Midwest are causing concerns about air quality, even far from the flames. Understanding how wildfire smoke affects health can help you take simple steps to stay safe.</p>



<p>Dr. Jesse Bracamonte, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, warns, "Smoke, in general, can affect anyone's health, particularly if they're in areas where wildfires are occurring. It can cause anything from eye irritation to respiratory infection; Generally, respiratory issues and difficulty breathing; even placing your heart at risk for cardiac strain."</p>



<p>He adds that the smoky conditions can be particularly worrisome for people with preexisting conditions. "Those most at risk include those with underlying cardiac issues or underlying pulmonary issues, such as asthma or COPD," he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte advises keeping an eye on air quality measures in your area. "If certain levels are high, it's recommended that you stay indoors," he says. "Try to close up windows as much as possible. Try to make sure you have a central air conditioning system so that the air is circulated in your home appropriately."</p>



<p>Health effects of breathing in smoke may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Coughing</li>



<li>Trouble breathing normally</li>



<li>Stinging eyes</li>



<li>Scratchy throat</li>



<li>Runny nose</li>



<li>Irritated sinuses&nbsp;</li>



<li>Wheezing and shortness of breath</li>



<li>Chest pains</li>



<li>Headaches</li>



<li>Asthma attack</li>



<li>Tiredness&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fast heartbeat</li>
</ul>



<p>He says in some instances where the air quality is poor, you're at high risk and must go outdoors, you might consider the use of a respirator to avoid underlying lung injury.</p>

<p>Dengue fever is a potentially life-threatening viral infection transmitted through the bite of infected mosquitoes.</p>



<p>"Four different subtypes of the virus can cause infections in humans," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rizza-stacey-a-m-d/bio-20054180?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Stacey Rizza</a>, a Mayo Clinic infectious diseases specialist.

<p>Approximately half of the world's population lives in areas vulnerable to dengue fever, particularly in hot and humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>



<p>"That's why you see it in parts of the world such as Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and even some parts of the southern U.S., around Florida and Louisiana.," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>The primary transmitter of dengue fever is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to bite during both day and night. About 1 in 4 people infected with the virus will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Symptoms of dengue fever</strong></h2>



<p>"They usually notice fevers, body aches, bone aches, muscle aches; many times, they even describe an aching behind their eyes. They can get some nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea," Dr. Rizza says.</p>



<p>While most people recover within about a week, severe cases can lead to life-threatening emergencies.</p>



<p>Symptoms of severe dengue fever may include:</p>



<p>• Severe stomach pain.<br>• Persistent vomiting.<br>• Bleeding from your gums or nose.<br>• Blood in your urine, stool or vomit.<br>• Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising.<br>• Difficult or rapid breathing.<br>• Fatigue.<br>• Irritability or restlessness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no medicine to treat dengue fever.</p>



<p>"There's no antiviral or no treatment for dengue fever," she says. "It's what we call supportive therapy. Maintaining good hydration, particularly as people are sick and having fevers, is important. They can use acetaminophen to take care of the fevers, bring down the temperature, and then ensure they take in fluids and still get some form of eating."</p>



<p>"If they become severely ill and aren't able to keep up with their fluid status, they should go to their hospital and may require hospitalization to help support them," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>Though there is no direct treatment, a vaccine is approved in many countries for children ages 9-16 who have previously shown evidence of dengue infection. Dr. Rizza says the vaccine is not approved in the U.S.</p>



<p>"You give it to people who have already had immunologic evidence of a previous dengue infection, and then you give it to them to help prevent them from becoming reinfected," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>



<p>Preventing mosquito bites is vital to avoiding dengue fever. Here are some strategies:</p>



<p>• Use bug spray with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus to prevent mosquito bites.<br>• Remove any stagnant water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.<br>• Eliminate items that hold water, such as vases and flowerpot saucers.<br>• Ensure intact window screens and closed doors to keep mosquitoes outside.<br>• Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants.</p>



<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for several viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I was recently diagnosed with advanced-stage endometriosis and I am told I need to have surgery. I still want children someday — should I be worried about my future fertility? What else should I know about recovering from surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;As you are learning, endometriosis is a condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.&nbsp;It can cause <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-to-seek-care-for-pelvic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious pain</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With advanced-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-the-answer/">endome</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-the-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-the-answer/">riosis</a>&nbsp;and things such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uterine fibroids</a>&nbsp;and large&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cysts</a>, we do our best to minimize the negative effects on fertility and instead actually optimize for pregnancy. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/myomectomy/about/pac-20384710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myomectomy</a>&nbsp;for uterine preservation, for example, allows women to maintain their uterus, even with large fibroids. Similarly, removing endometriosis but leaving the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries intact ensures there is still the possibility of future pregnancy and can even promote a successful pregnancy. Even when large, endometriosis-filled cysts are present (endometriomas), we are able to remove the abnormal tissue but leave the normal, healthy ovarian tissue in place for future fertility and hormonal needs.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;biggest question I get from patients after surgery is, "When can I get back to life?" Patients have families, jobs or responsibilities outside of their own health. We know that women especially can struggle with that balance of taking care of themselves while also taking care of everyone around them. Understanding what those constraints are from a personal perspective and getting women back to their lives as quickly as possible are among the key things that we focus on.</p>



<p>The best recommendation I have for anyone going into surgery is to be the healthiest you that you can be. The less&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-basics/hlv-20049495">stress</a>&nbsp;you have, the better your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-blog/hlv-20049477?p=1">diet</a>&nbsp;is and the more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379">rest</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&nbsp;that you've been getting is all going to support your body through the stress of surgery, which in turn is going to help speed along the recovery. The other thing I always make sure my patients are aware of is that, after surgery, be prepared to need some assistance doing daily things until the pain and fatigue lifts. It's normal to need a bit of help, so be prepared for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advances that we've had in technology when it comes to surgical procedures have pushed the envelope and allowed us to do the majority of gynecologic procedures through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minimally-invasive-surgery/about/pac-20384771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimally invasive</a>&nbsp;approach. This means most patients are back at work a couple of weeks after surgery, depending on the procedure, but have a speedy recovery because we're not negatively affecting their bodies any more than necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other thing to keep in mind from a recovery perspective is not every surgery is the same. There are some surgical procedures where the total downtime is only the day of surgery. In contrast, if we're doing something such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/multimedia/types-of-hysterectomy-surgery/img-20007786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomy</a>&nbsp;to remove the uterus— even if it's done through small incisions — we want to ensure that healing happens well. So we don't want any heavy lifting or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-intensity/art-20046887#:~:text=Vigorous%20aerobic%20exercise%20includes%20activities,for%20health%20and%20fitness%20benefits." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strenuous exercise</a>&nbsp;for typically six weeks after surgery. However, we do want normal physical activity to start even the day of surgery because that really helps maintain strength and normal body function, which helps speed along the recovery.</p>



<p>My team and I like to&nbsp;develop a close relationship with our patients to make sure that we know what their fertility goals are for the future and any barriers that might potentially stand in that way. Talk to your healthcare team about any other concerns, and best wishes to you during this time.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wasson-megan-n-d-o/bio-20234473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Megan Wasson, D.O</strong></a><em><strong>., Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</strong></em></p>

<p>Each year, more than 2 million children are seen in the emergency department in the U.S. because of fall-related injuries.</p>



<p>"The injuries can vary widely, and it's somewhat dependent on the age range for the patient," says Halada.</p>



<p>Infants and toddlers often get hurt tumbling off beds and changing tables. Windows and stairs can also lead to unintentional bumps and bruises.</p>



<p>"One way to prevent falls around the home would be to make sure that you have properly installed safety gates for your stairs and guards for the window," explains Halada.</p>



<p>Bigger kids sometimes end up at the hospital because of injuries related to biking, roller-skating and other recreational activities.</p>



<p>"Participation in any activity, you would want to make sure that the child is wearing correct and properly sized protective equipment, such as helmet, knee pads, elbow guards, wrist guards," says Halada.</p>



<p>Vigilant adult supervision can help reduce falls and accidents in children.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing pediatric falls</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Move furniture away from windows to prevent climbing.</li>



<li>Strap babies in high chairs, swings and strollers.</li>



<li>Never leave a child alone in a shopping cart.</li>



<li>Keep windows locked and closed when not in use.</li>



<li>Create safe play areas.</li>



<li>Childproof home.</li>



<li>Always supervise young children.</li>
