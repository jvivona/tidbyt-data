<p><em>New program provides biopharma and medical device companies access to de-identified data, advanced AI, provider expertise and global distribution.</em>&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>ROCHESTER, Minn.<strong> </strong>— Mayo Clinic today announced the launch of <a href="https://www.mayoclinicplatform.org/orchestrate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Platform_Orchestrate</a>, a new program designed to accelerate clinical development and help biopharma and medical device companies bring innovative therapies to patients faster.&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&amp;nbsp;</strong>I've read so much about the health benefits of tracking my steps. But there's a lot of confusing information out there. How many is the right number? Are some "steps" better for you than others? Please help.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Whether you're tracking steps with your phone, a smartwatch or an old-school pedometer, the result is the same: you'll have a good indicator of how much you're moving during the day. The best <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tomorrows-cure-keeping-tabs-on-health-with-wearable-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">device </a>for you is the one you'll use. With many devices, you can set up alerts and goals that remind you to move. And that's what counts. The ultimate goal is to move 150 minutes per week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reaping the benefits</strong></h2>



<p>You're right about the health benefits of getting in your steps. Here's what&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-walking-is-a-step-toward-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walking</a>&amp;nbsp;can help you do:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Control your blood pressure.</li>



<li>Lose or maintain weight.</li>



<li>Improve balance and coordination.</li>



<li>Increase core strength.</li>



<li>Manage stress and improve mood by releasing endorphins.</li>



<li>Manage your diabetes.</li>



<li>Reduce the risk of a heart attack.</li>



<li>Reduce the risk of developing&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/basics/definition/con-20031902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2 diabetes</a>.</li>



<li>Stay strong and active.</li>
</ul>



<p>Walking also has been shown to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improve sleep.</li>



<li>Slow mental decline.</li>



<li>Lower the risk of dementia.</li>



<li>Reduce the risk of some cancers.</li>



<li>Help you lead a longer life.</li>



<li>Maintain independent living into older age.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you're on a medically assisted weight-loss journey, whether that's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-bypass-surgery/in-depth/weight-loss-surgery/art-20045334">bariatric surgery</a> or a GLP-1 drug, being physically active will help burn calories, build strength, maintain muscle mass and bone density, and promote sustainable weight loss. It also can help medications work better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracking steps</strong></h2>



<p>Is there a magic number of steps for reaping these health benefits? Not really. If you can get in 10,000 steps a day, great. Research has shown that 10,000 steps a day can lead to reductions in premature death, with a majority of that reduction happening between 4,000 and 8,000 steps. After 10,000, you'll still see benefits, but they start to plateau.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>How you get your steps doesn't really matter. Walking has a cumulative effect on your body across your day. So whether you&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/why-dogs-are-good-for-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk your dog&amp;nbsp;</a>for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, go for a brisk 30-minute walk or spend an hour moving around the house or working in the yard, those steps all count.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting started</strong></h2>



<p>The best way to start tracking your steps is to take it slow and steady. Listen to your body — it will tell you whether you're trying to do too much. Work more steps into your day by parking farther away from entrances, walking in place while you're waiting for the timer on the microwave to go off, and making multiple trips to bring in packages rather than loading up in just one. You may want to consider getting a walking pad and use it while watching TV or doing food prep in the kitchen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Setting the pace</strong></h2>



<p>When you're advised to go for a brisk walk, what does that mean? "Brisk" is different for everyone. The average walking speed to aim for is 3 to 3.5 mph, which a device can help you measure. If you can walk faster safely, great. However, walking slowly is better than not walking at all and will still give you the benefits of moving your body.</p>



<p>The talk test is an easy way to identify a proper intensity. If you're able to talk but find it difficult to carry on a full conversation, that's "brisk" for you. You may not be out of breath, but your breathing is definitely elevated. New research indicates that brisk walking can boost brain function and well-being, as well as physical health.</p>



<p>Even if you're able to get in a little bit of walking every day, your body responds to this exercise, and you gain the benefits.</p>

<p>Kenneth Adams understands the importance of love, resilience and family. After his wife's passing in 2022, Adams reconnected with a lifelong friend, whom he had known for nearly 50 years. Kenneth and Susan Kidd<em>&amp;nbsp;</em>eventually fell in love, and they were committed to building a life together.</p>



<p>"We love to travel and spend time with family — we wanted our relationship to be an example for our grandchildren. And to us, marriage was the next step," Adams said.</p>



<p>While making plans for a wedding in early 2025, Kenneth became ill and was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/symptoms-of-sepsis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sepsis</a>. His complex condition required coordinated care, so the team at Mayo Clinic developed a plan: antibiotics administered intravenously every day for six weeks. Instead of staying in the hospital for the duration of the treatment, Kenneth's care team determined he was a candidate for Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797">Advanced Ca</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re at Home </a>program.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Going home</strong></h2>



<p>Advanced Care at Home offers patients high-acuity care, delivered in the comfort of their home. With around-the-clock access, advanced technology and a dedicated in-home care team, patients receive comprehensive treatment while minimizing stress and disruption to daily life.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"With Advanced Care at Home, we can treat, monitor and communicate with patients as we would in a hospital setting, without recreating the feeling of being in a hospital setting," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maniaci-michael-j-m-d/bio-20054934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michael Maniaci</a>, director of Advanced Care at Home.</p>



<p>For Kenneth, receiving treatment at home allowed him to maintain his routine, enjoy meals and sleep without interruption.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“The program provided everything you would need in a hospital but with the comforts of home and closeness of family," Kenneth says. "They had the procedures down, the infrastructure and the systems in place — it was a dream come true."</p>



<p>As the end of his treatment neared and his strength improved, Kenneth and Susan began thinking about a wedding ceremony again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A wedding between treatments</strong></h2>



<p>On May 19, 2025, Kenneth and Susan invited a pair of close friends and a pastor to their Ponte Vedra, Florida, home. The couple was married in their backyard, and just an hour after saying "I do," Kenneth received one of his daily treatments.</p>



<p>"Getting married was a goal for Mr. Adams, so as his care team, we made sure he could achieve that goal safely and on his terms," Dr. Maniaci says.</p>



<p>Kenneth credits Advanced Care at Home with making the wedding possible. He was discharged from the program a week later with no signs of sepsis.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“People heal better at home," he says. “I feel that I'm living proof of that. There was no burden on my family — the team handled everything – and by being at home, I could get married,” Kenneth says.</p>



<p>By late July, Kenneth was well enough to resume another passion: travel. A trip that had been postponed earlier in the year was back on the calendar as a honeymoon. Looking ahead, Kenneth is preparing for an annual family trip in October. He continues to live with purpose and gratitude.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to do what I can, while I can,” Kenneth says. "I can do so much more with my health restored."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&amp;nbsp;</strong>For my kids, the best part of back-to-school shopping is picking out a new backpack. While I want them to have backpacks they like, I also want to make sure they have features that support their backs. What should I look for?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The backpack is as much a part of school life as homework, pencils and recess. Kids use backpacks to carry everything they need during the day and make a fashion statement. Unfortunately, the excess weight of supplies stuffed into an improperly worn backpack may lead to sore joints and muscles.</p>



<p>As a new school year begins, follow these tips to help kids take a load off to keep their backs healthy:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Limit the weight.</strong></h2>



<p>Students of all ages seem to carry heavier loads in their backpacks. They often tote a day's worth of textbooks, a change of clothing for after-school activities, school projects and lunch. As a result, many parents have heard their school-age children complaining of&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/back-pain/basics/definition/con-20020797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back pain</a>.</p>



<p>Overall, adults and children shouldn't carry more than 15% of their body weight in a backpack. For a 60-pound child, that means a pack weighing less than 9 pounds.</p>



<p>Even when worn properly, your student may need to lean forward to compensate for extra backpack weight. This can affect the natural curve in the lower back. Extra weight also can cause a rounding of the shoulders and an increased curve of the upper back. As a result, children may experience back, shoulder and neck pain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Adjust them properly.</strong></h2>



<p>When worn properly, backpacks are the best way to carry things, especially for long periods of time.</p>



<p>Backpacks should be worn using both straps. Slinging a backpack over one shoulder can cause a person to lean to one side to compensate for the uneven weight, causing a curve in the spine. Over time, this can lead to lower and upper back pain, strained shoulders and neck, and even functional&amp;nbsp;<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/scoliosis/home/ovc-20193685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scoliosis</a>&amp;nbsp;(curvature of the spine). Teenage girls are especially susceptible to scoliosis.</p>



<p>Tighten the straps so the pack sits high on your child's back with the top of the pack about even with the shoulder blades. It also should be snug, so it doesn't sway side to side while walking.</p>



<p>When properly worn, the back and abdominal muscles support a backpack. These are the strongest muscles in the body, stabilizing the trunk and holding the body in proper postural alignment. Improper backpack use presents some dangers to young, still-growing joints and muscles.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Look for key pack features.</strong></h2>



<p>Urge your children to look past the color or design when selecting a backpack. These features can make a significant difference in how they feel while wearing the pack at school:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Wide straps</strong><br>Wide, padded straps won't dig into the shoulders, and they're more comfortable. Narrow straps can hinder circulation, causing numbness or tingling in the arms, which may lead to weakness in the hands over time.</li>



<li><strong>Multiple sections</strong><br>Select a backpack with many pockets and sections to keep children organized. This also helps distribute the weight more evenly across the pack.</li>



<li><strong>Waist belt</strong><br>Tightening the waist belt helps to evenly distribute the weight of the backpack and support children's abdominal muscles.</li>



<li><strong>Lightweight when empty</strong><br>Consider the weight of the backpack when it's empty so your children don't have additional weight beyond books and supplies. For example, a canvas backpack will be lighter than leather.</li>



<li><strong>Reflective material</strong><br>If your children walk or bike to school, look for a backpack with reflective strips that make them more noticeable to drivers. You also can add strips of reflective tape at home.</li>
</ul>



<p>Encourage your children to wear their backpacks properly. To help keep them light, they should make frequent stops at their lockers throughout the day to avoid carrying all their books at once. And leave nonessentials at home.</p>



<p>If they're in pain or have discomfort, talk with their primary care clinicians before a problem becomes serious.</p>

<p><em>When Dr. Sam Sayed relocated to Rochester, Minnesota, for residency, he brought his nonprofit with him through the support of a Mayo Clinic Community Contributions grant.&nbsp;</em></p>



<p>When <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/emergency-medicine-residency-minnesota/meet-our-trainees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sam Sayed</a> was in elementary school, his older sister, Dayna, took him and his brother to the shoe store where she worked. She offered to buy any sneakers they wanted.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For two boys growing up in poverty, this was a pivotal moment.</p>



<p>"We were discount-store or hand-me-down kids — we had never gotten to do anything like that," says Dr. Sayed, an <a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/emergency-medicine-residency-minnesota/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">emergency medicine resident</a> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "We can still recall the shoes and how they made us feel. We want other kids to feel that too."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly 30 years later, Dr. Sayed helped give 56 Rochester Boys &amp;amp; Girls Club members that same gift. He applied for a Mayo Clinic Community Contributions grant through his nonprofit, Dayna's Footprints, funding an Aug. 13 event that let the kids pick their dream kicks at a local shoe store.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"They were joyous — one kid said, 'This is the best day of my life,'" says Dr. Sayed. "One boy picked a pair based on his favorite soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo. As soon as he picked them up, he did the classic Ronaldo celebration — run to the corner and do a 360 — over and over."</p>

<p>Their excitement reflected the day's deeper meaning — both for the kids and the many Mayo volunteers who made the event possible.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I know what it's like to show up in worn-out shoes and pretend you don't notice the comments," says Dr. Sammy Arab, a postdoctoral research fellow at Mayo and the event lead for Dayna's Footprints in Rochester. "We’re not just handing out shoes. We're giving kids dignity. We're telling them they matter."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A purpose-driven mission</strong></h2>



<p>For Dr. Sayed, this isn't simply a passion project — it's a way to honor his sister's legacy.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Not long after Dayna bought him his Nike Slants, she was tragically killed in a drive-by shooting.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"We lost her, but we didn't lose her spirit," Dr. Sayed says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>In 2018, he and his brother, Sharif, raised money to provide shoes for a family at their former school, inspired by what Dayna had done for them. They ended up helping 53 kids.</p>



<p>This compelled them to start Dayna's Footprints. After Dr. Sayed joined Mayo, they expanded to Rochester — a full-circle moment, since Dayna was born in Minneapolis.</p>



<p>This has given him a special way to fulfill his mission as a physician.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"I don't want to wait for a patient to show up in the Emergency Department on their worst day. I want to know the community I serve," says Dr. Sayed. "At Mayo Clinic, it's about treating the patient in every facet of life. Before they show up and after they leave, Mayo cares."&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>His perspective&amp;nbsp;exemplifies Mayo Clinic's commitment to patients — past, present and future.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is about looking ahead — and with these kids, we're trying to intervene early," says Dr. Sayed. "We're treating them before they ever come here. We're giving them the confidence to believe they can overcome the circumstances they were born into."&amp;nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I have two sons, ages 5 and 11. My eldest is always excited to start school and have new adventures. My younger son will begin kindergarten this year. Although he went to child care part-time, my younger son has begun to express concern about being away from me all day and is showing increased anxiety as we talk about school. How can I help him be less anxious?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Getting ready for a new school year can be exciting for children, parents and caregivers. It may also be a major cause of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anxiety</a>&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-basics/hlv-20049495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a>.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Most people get nervous when they face change. Whether kids are heading off to elementary, middle or high school, or even college, leaving the safety and familiarity of home can prompt feelings of fear.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the most helpful things you can do is reassure your son that what he's feeling is normal.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/separation-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20377455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Separation anxiety</a> happens to many people of all ages. Then, as much as possible, help him gradually gain exposure to, and get comfortable with, going to school.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Talking through fears</strong></h2>



<p>Try to gain a sense of what it is about school that makes your son nervous. Is he concerned about making new friends? Is he concerned about the teachers? Is he worried about the classwork? Is there something new that may be causing anxiety, like riding a bus? Sometimes, just being able to talk about those details and put the nervousness into words can help a child who is feeling anxious.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Continuing to show love, support and warmth can go a long way. Share with your son an experience you had when you were anxious about facing something new. Talk to him about how you handled the situation. Ask your older child to share some experiences and how he overcame his fears. Doing this will let your younger child know that he is not alone in the situation, that it is OK to be nervous, and he can get through it.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Preparing ahead of time</strong></h2>



<p>To help your son prepare for school, talk to him about what his school day might be like. You could also visit the school to meet his teachers, take a tour of his classroom, see the playground, or even locate the bus stop. If your son is nervous about getting on the school bus, call the transportation department to see if he can meet the bus driver early.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Another idea is to find social opportunities with other incoming kindergarten students. Reach out to parents of children in your neighborhood who will be going to school for the first time. Then, plan a social gathering at a local playground.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>A week or two before school starts, develop a routine. Begin to wake up early and get ready on time. Also, consider practicing some schoolwork. You can get your older child involved in sharing his thoughts about what was the best part of school when he was that age.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Spending time apart</strong></h2>



<p>Begin by spending some time away from your son. Maybe it's having your child go to a friend's home for an hour. Then, slowly increase the time away from your son so that he has an opportunity to feel comfortable being with others for longer periods of time.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these steps will help him know what to expect, prepare him gradually for what school will be like, and ease the transition. This approach is based on one of the core principles of treating anxiety. That is, when you are frightened of something that is not dangerous, you need to have practice dealing with the source of your fear until it becomes routine or boring. You cannot be talked out of anxiety. You need exposure to, and experience in, dealing with the situation.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>If your child is resistant to the attempts you are making, or if his anxiety doesn't decrease even after you've taken these steps, talk with your pediatrician or primary care clinician about seeing a healthcare professional who can help. Books on&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/product/anxiety-coach/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coaching for anxiety</a>&nbsp;can also be a resource. Anxiety is a normal part of life that can't be completely eliminated, but many successful strategies can reduce anxiety and how often it causes problems.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>We have a new fitness facility nearby. The pool schedule shows a number of aqua exercise classes. I'd like to try a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ready-to-get-in-on-the-aquatic-fitness-movement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water fitness</a> class to add variety to my regular fitness routine, but can I really get a good workout in water?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>Regular exercise provides a wide range of benefits, including weight management, improved cardiovascular health and sleep quality. But for many people, common forms of exercise, such as walking, running and weight training, are a struggle due to pain, weakness, mobility issues or fear of falling.</p>



<p>Aquatic exercise is an excellent way to focus on fitness in a gravity-reduced environment. Here's why:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Buoyancy.</strong>&amp;nbsp;When standing waist-deep in water, buoyancy reduces your body weight by 50%, making this form of exercise very low impact. This significantly reduces the stress on your weight-bearing joints and bones.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Support.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Water provides support for people with balance problems. The constant movement of water during a workout also challenges a person's balance. The more waves there are, the harder it is to balance and exercise.</li>



<li><strong>Resistance.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Water's viscosity slows movement and provides resistance, making aquatic exercise a great, resistance-training workout. With less joint stress, people find they can work out longer and do more repetitions.</li>
</ul>



<p>All these benefits make water exercise an effective option for anyone recovering from a sports injury to regain range of motion, strength and endurance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>But these benefits also mean you can get a good, overall workout that improves strength, cardio and flexibility. As with any exercise, check with your healthcare team before starting a new routine.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Five things to know before jumping into the pool</strong></h2>



<p><strong>1. Aquatic exercise is versatile.</strong></p>



<p>Aquatic exercise offers a variety of options and techniques for almost all levels of physical ability. These range from basic, such as walking in the water, to more high-level aerobic activities, such as deep-water running or swimming.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Standing exercises often are performed in water that's waist to chest deep, and they typically focus on improving range of motion/flexibility, balance and strength. Resistance training can be amplified by simply increasing the speed and range of movement or adding equipment that increases drag, such as webbed mitts, paddles, noodles or bands.</p>



<p><strong>2. You don’t need to know how to swim.</strong></p>



<p>Having a basic knowledge of swimming or water safety is a good idea for anyone who's around water, but aquatic exercise doesn't necessarily involve swimming. The shallow end of any pool or lake will do, since for many of the movements, you only need to be able to stand in the water.</p>



<p><strong>3. Water temperature is important.</strong></p>



<p>Aquatic exercise in lower water temperatures (82-88 F) is generally best for higher-level intensity exercise or people who are prone to overheating, such as those who are pregnant, obese or have multiple sclerosis. Aquatic exercise in warmer temperatures (84-92 F) is better for people with arthritis, fibromyalgia or pain, as well as those who are frail.</p>



<p><strong>4. Be aware of your abilities.</strong></p>



<p>With the increased ease of exercise in water, people often can tolerate longer exercise sessions. As a result, these sessions can be more intense, with larger ranges of motion, which creates the potential of overstressing your body. You may be more fatigued than expected following an aquatic exercise session.</p>



<p><strong>5. Consider group exercises to mix it up.</strong></p>



<p>Group aquatic exercise classes are a great way to socialize, build connections, find support, increase accountability and stay motivated to continue exercising. Classes often are led by instructors who have special training in exercising in an aquatic environment. The instructors are able to offer suggestions for adjusting exercises for individual participants, if needed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Beyond the basics</strong></h2>



<p>Amping up your water workout on your own or in a class may include resistance equipment such as:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Foam dumbbells.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Lightweight on land, they provide resistance underwater through flotation. They come in a variety of resistance options.</li>



<li><strong>Water weights.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Strap-on ankle or wrist weights increase resistance during arm and leg exercises.</li>



<li><strong>Hand paddles and resistance gloves.</strong>&amp;nbsp;They enhance strength training.</li>



<li><strong>Buoyancy belt.</strong>&amp;nbsp;Helps keep your head above water in the deep end while leaving your hands free. You can run, lift weights and do other workouts using your hands without having to tread water.</li>
</ul>



<p>People often enjoy working out more in water than on land. When they're not in pain or afraid of falling and are having fun, it encourages them to exercise more consistently. You can even get&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;a good workout without getting your hair wet.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>We just moved to an area with a lot of opportunities for water recreation and are so excited about our first summer on the water. But we want to make sure everyone stays safe. Can you give us some pointers for water safety?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>Nothing beats a day at the lake, river, beach or pool for fun, fitness, fishing and relaxation. While spending time on and around the water this summer, these tips can ensure that everyone is safe, has fun and enjoys the time together.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Learn to swim</strong></h2>



<p>Every year in the U.S., about 4,000 people die by drowning. Children, men and nonwhite people are at the highest risk.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning to swim is one of the most important ways to stay safe on the water. The American Academy of Pediatrics supports swimming lessons for most children ages 4 and older. Lessons for children ages 1 to 4 could be appropriate, depending on how often they're exposed to water. Even infants can be introduced to the water. Check to see what classes are available in your area.</p>



<p>Swimmers of all ages may be more familiar with pools than rivers and may not know what to do if caught in a current. Stay calm, float on your back, and when you come to a calmer area, flip over and swim diagonally toward shore with the flow of the current.</p>



<p>Keep these safety tips in mind too:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Don't swim alone.</li>



<li>Supervise children when they're swimming, and stay close enough to reach out to a child at any time.</li>



<li>Before diving into a body of water, know the water depth and if there are any underwater obstacles.</li>



<li>Keep pool gates closed at all times, and consider an alarm to alert you if the gate is opened.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Wear a personal floatation device</strong></h2>



<p>Even expert swimmers can get into trouble during an emergency. It's important to be sure everyone in a watercraft wears a U.S. Coast Guard-approved personal flotation device. While boating or swimming, remember that arm floaties and inflatable toys aren't a substitute and tend to give kids and families a false sense of security.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Excellent, comfortable, easy-to-put-on models of personal flotation devices are available, so there's really no excuse not to wear one.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stay safe while boating, no matter your craft</strong></h2>



<p>One of the most popular and fun activities of summer is spending time on the water. Boating creates lifelong memories and gives us the opportunity to unplug, spend time together, learn new skills and explore new areas.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Whether your craft is a power boat, fishing boat, pontoon, personal watercraft, canoe or kayak, you should remember these basic safety rules as you head out for a day on the water:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be a weather watcher.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Summer weather can change quickly. Check the forecast before heading out and check again frequently while on the water. If you do get caught in a storm, navigate to the shore as quickly as possible.</li>



<li><strong>Tell someone the details of your trip.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Tell your trip plan to a friend who's staying ashore. Share details about who's on the boat, where you'll be and how long you'll be gone.</li>



<li><strong>Always operate your boat at a safe speed.&amp;nbsp;</strong>Waterways can become crowded during the summer. Slow down, stay alert and steer clear of larger vessels. Be sure to follow speed limits in "no wake" areas.</li>



<li><strong>Respect buoys and other navigational aids.&amp;nbsp;</strong>They've been put in place to ensure your safety and the safety of other boaters and swimmers. If you're not familiar with them, the U.S. Coast Guard has a handy&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.uscgboating.org/images/486.PDF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water navigation system guide</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Leave alcohol on shore.&amp;nbsp;</strong>The risk of drowning or injury significantly increases when alcohol or drugs are involved. More than 70% of water recreation deaths are related to alcohol use.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Be sun savvy</strong></h2>



<p>The sun's rays can be intense on the open water. Protect everyone with hats, sunglasses and sunscreen. Look for water-resistant, broad-spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Apply sunscreen generously and reapply every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Drink plenty of water</strong></h2>



<p>Even when surrounded by water, it's possible to become dehydrated. Sitting in the sun can increase your body's temperature. Pack plenty of water for each person, and drink some water every 15 to 20 minutes to remain properly hydrated.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&amp;nbsp;</strong>This is kind of embarrassing, but, for a while, I’ve been leaking urine. Can something be done to fix this incontinence problem?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>You don’t have to live with this issue. The three main types of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-incontinence/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20352814" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">urinary incontinence</a>&amp;nbsp;are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stress incontinence</strong>&amp;nbsp;— due to leakage with activities, such as lifting, climbing stairs or strenuous activity.</li>



<li><strong>Urge incontinence</strong>&amp;nbsp;— related to leakage associated with the feeling or urge to urinate.</li>



<li><strong>Mixed incontinence</strong>&amp;nbsp;— a combination of stress and urge incontinence.</li>
</ul>



<p>Incontinence can be treated with behavioral changes, exercises, medications, nerve stimulation and injections. Surgical options are also available.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Stress incontinence in men</strong></h2>



<p>Up to 10% of men may experience stress incontinence after prostate surgery due to multiple factors related to the patient's anatomy, prostate cancer and the surgery performed. Ultimately, this leads to a weakened sphincter muscle and laxity of the pelvic floor. The sphincter muscles control the release of urine, and the urethra is the small tube that empties the bladder.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>A prostatectomy procedure removes some of the control provided by the prostate and bladder, making the patient reliant solely on the external sphincter muscle.</p>



<p>Normally, the sphincter remains closed as the bladder fills with urine until you can reach a restroom. The weakened muscles and relaxed pelvic floor have trouble holding urine, so any movement that exerts a force on the abdominal and pelvic muscles puts pressure on the bladder and can cause leakage. This force could be sneezing, bending over, lifting or even laughing.</p>



<p>Postsurgery stress incontinence symptoms may resolve on their own with time and pelvic physical therapy. Usually, patients can see continued improvement for 12 months after surgery and try nonsurgical treatments, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/kegels-are-for-men-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical therapy</a>, before considering surgical treatment options, such as male urethral slings and artificial urinary sphincters.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Male urethral slings</strong></h2>



<p>Male urethral slings are indicated for men with mild to moderate stress urinary incontinence, which is defined as using one to four pads per day. The surgeon uses a synthetic mesh material to create a sling, or hammock, to support and pull the urethra and pelvic floor back toward their original locations. Some slings also provide compression support for the sphincter muscles.</p>



<p>A cystoscopy test will be needed before the surgery to confirm that the sphincter muscles are working.</p>



<p>Male urethral slings are performed as an outpatient procedure, and patients can go home the same day. Heavy lifting and strenuous exercise are restricted for about six weeks. Patients need to be careful when climbing ladders and squatting for about three months after surgery because significant hip flexing can loosen the sling.</p>



<p>About 80% of men with male urethral slings see an improvement in their symptoms after surgery, with the majority of them no longer needing pads after surgery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Artificial urinary sphincters</strong></h2>



<p>This surgical procedure is more invasive than male urethral slings and appropriate for men with severe stress incontinence, which is defined as using more than four pads per day. It's also a good option for patients who have damage to sphincter muscles from radiation therapy or a failed male urethral sling.</p>



<p>The placement of artificial urinary sphincters has multiple components. A small cuff is placed around the urethra, replacing the sphincter muscle's function. Tubes connect the cuff to a pressure-regulating balloon placed in the lower pelvic region and a pump in the scrotum. The pump is manually operated to open the cuff on the urethra and allow urine to be released from the body.</p>



<p>Some patients can go home the same day as surgery, while others will require an overnight hospital stay to recover.</p>



<p>After surgery, the artificial urinary sphincter isn't activated for about a month while the body heals. During this time, heavy lifting and exercise are restricted. Patients return to the clinic and are taught how to properly use the device. With proper training and consistent use, artificial urinary sphincters are effective at treating symptoms of severe stress urinary incontinence in men.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare team if you're experiencing urinary incontinence symptoms or are concerned about your prostate or urinary health.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I've taken up running again and decided to enter a half-marathon. I know I have to push myself to get ready for the race, but I don't want to overdo it. What should I watch out for as I train?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&amp;nbsp;</strong>We're surrounded by warning signs — on the roads, at work, and on packaging and equipment. Your body sends warning signs, too. As your race date nears, it's tempting to pull out all the stops. But that makes this a prime time to watch for warning signs of overtraining.</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/ready-to-run-what-are-some-signs-of-overtraining/">Overtraining</a> or overuse injuries are any muscle, joint or bony injuries, such as tendinitis or a stress fracture, that result from repetitive trauma. Overuse injuries typically occur because of training or technique errors.</p>



<p>Runners are tenacious athletes. Pulling back and slowing down may be tough, but while some overtraining issues can be resolved with simple rest, others may evolve into more significant problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How overtraining and overuse injuries occur</strong></h2>



<p>Going too fast, exercising for too long or simply doing too much of one type of activity can strain your muscles and lead to an overuse injury. Improper technique also takes a toll on your body. For example, if you use poor form while running or doing strength-training exercises, you may overload certain areas of the body, which can cause an overuse injury.</p>



<p>Thankfully, most overuse injuries are avoidable. Try these suggestions to prevent them:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Use proper form and gear.</strong><br>Whether you're starting a new activity or have been playing a sport for a long time, taking lessons can help ensure you're using the correct technique. Talk with an expert about proper form, equipment and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/expert-advice-on-finding-the-best-shoe-fit">gear fit</a>&amp;nbsp;to help ensure success.</li>



<li><strong>Pace yourself.</strong><br>Rely on your training program, which should spread your&amp;nbsp;aerobic activity&amp;nbsp;throughout the week. Take time to warm up before physical activity and cool down afterward.</li>



<li><strong>Gradually increase your activity level.</strong><br>When changing the intensity or duration of physical activity, do so&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-jump-start-your-workout/">gradually</a>. Try not to increase anything by more than about 10% per week. Your body needs time to adapt to the new stress.</li>



<li><strong>Mix up your routine.</strong><br>Instead of focusing on one type of exercise,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/offseason-sports-training-tips">build variety</a>&amp;nbsp;into your training program. Doing a variety of low-impact activities prevents overuse injuries and allows your body to use different muscle groups.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Overtraining signs and what to do&amp;nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>It can be hard to know when you’re pushing through your training for continuous improvement and when you’re moving into overtraining. Your feet and legs take a pounding as you run mile after mile, so watch for these issues:&amp;nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Callous blistering and broken toenails are common overtraining problems.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Early morning pain on the sole of your foot can be a sign of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/heel-pain-might-be-plantar-fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a>.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Tendinitis can leave you with pain in the back of your ankle or in the front of your shins, also called&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/dont-let-shin-splints-stop-your-workout/">shin splints</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, these can be treated with rest and medication to relieve pain and inflammation. Slow down your training. Return to the level you were at before the problem or consider cross-training with low- or no-impact exercise, such as a stationary bike, elliptical or swimming. Take an extra day off. These symptoms can be short-term if you treat them early and appropriately.</p>



<p>If pain continues despite rest or gets worse, it could indicate a bone issue, which is potentially serious. Stress reactions or stress fractures are common in the mid-foot, mid-shin or, most concerning, high up in your leg by your hip. Pain that doesn't go away is a symptom, so consult your healthcare team.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What to do if you suspect an overuse injury</strong></h2>



<p>Tell your healthcare practitioner if you've recently changed your workout technique, intensity, duration, frequency or types of exercises. Identifying the cause of your overuse injury will help you correct the problem and avoid repeating it. You can seek further guidance by talking with specialists such as sports medicine physicians, athletic trainers and physical therapists.</p>



<p>Once your injury has healed, ask a specialist to check that you've completely regained strength, motion, flexibility and balance before beginning the activity again. Pay special attention to proper technique to avoid future injuries.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Staying strong</strong></h2>



<p>Don't allow an overuse injury to prevent you from being physically active. By working with a specialist, listening to your body and pacing yourself, you can avoid this common setback and safely increase your activity level.</p>



<p>Knowing you worked hard to prepare will add to your feeling of accomplishment on race day, but don’t overdo it. You’re almost there. Take care of yourself so you can keep going strong all the way to the finish line.</p>
