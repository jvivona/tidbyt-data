<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can identify <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)</a> using the results from an electrocardiogram (ECG) – a common heart test. The innovation could make it faster, cheaper, and easier to spot sleep apnea, particularly in women, who are often underdiagnosed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A common but underrecognized condition</strong></h2>



<p>OSA affects more than 936 million adults ages 30-69 worldwide and poses significant cardiovascular risks. People with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-obstructive-sleep-apnea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OSA</a> experience repeated episodes of upper airway collapse or blockage during sleep. This collapse causes breathing to stop or become shallow repeatedly, which often leads to loud snoring and gasping. Despite its prevalence, it often goes undiagnosed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of sleep apnea" class="wp-image-249304" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p></p>



<p>"Obstructive sleep apnea or OSA is a highly prevalent disease with important cardiovascular consequences," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/somers-virend-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virend Somers, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Alice Sheets Marriott Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine and senior author of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40961733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in JACC: Advances. "OSA affects the heart to the point where AI algorithms can detect the OSA signature from the ECG, which in essence is a representation of the electrical activity of the heart muscle cells," Dr. Somers adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI model shows strong performance — especially for women</strong></h2>



<p>In the study, the researchers used AI algorithms to review the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) test results of 11,299 patients at Mayo Clinic who had undergone the test along with sleep evaluations. More than 7,000 of them had a known diagnosis of OSA, and 4,000 were controls.</p>



<p>"The most surprising finding was the increased visibility on the ECG of OSA in the females compared to the males, even though the OSA severity was less in the females," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>"This is relevant since emerging data consistently suggest that females have a greater relative likelihood of suffering the cardiovascular consequences of OSA, even if their OSA may be considered 'milder' by standard diagnostic criteria," he adds.</p>



<p>The test also strongly suggests women may suffer more damage to their heart muscle cells from OSA, Dr. Somers says.</p>



<p>Dr. Somers underscores that this approach may have the potential to evaluate whether a given OSA treatment may be able to reduce a patient's cardiovascular risk.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I love the fall, but I dread the shorter days and how I feel. I've read about seasonal affective disorder, but could you please tell me more about it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasonal affective disorder</a>, or&nbsp;SAD, is a type of depression that's related to the changes in seasons. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721#symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Symptoms</a> typically appear in the fall, worsen through the winter months and eventually go away in the spring or summer. The answers to these questions should help you better understand SAD and determine if you should seek care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the possible causes of SAD?</strong></h2>



<p>While the exact cause is unknown, it may be linked to reduced sunlight, which reacts with the natural chemicals in your body, like serotonin and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/melatonin-use-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melatonin</a>,&nbsp;that determine mood and energy levels and regulate sleep.</p>



<p>SAD isn't just a case of the&nbsp;winter blues, a condition that is milder and more common. SAD symptoms can make it difficult to function at home, work and in social settings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who is most at risk for experiencing symptoms of SAD?</strong></h2>



<p>People who live in the northern half of the U.S., where daylight hours are shorter and there's less sunlight, are at more risk. It's estimated that about 20% of people in this region could have symptoms of SAD. It's believed that SAD runs in families, and it's more common in women.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the symptoms of SAD?</strong></h2>



<p>Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder to watch for include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>



<li>Feeling persistently tired and fatigued, including feeling a loss of energy nearly every day of the affected months.</li>



<li>Feelings of worthlessness.</li>



<li>Losing interest in things you would typically enjoy, such as hobbies and social activities.</li>



<li>Persistently feeling down or sad.</li>



<li>Sleep disturbances, which could include hypersomnia (sleeping too much) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insomnia</a>&nbsp;(difficulty falling asleep).</li>



<li>Thoughts of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-crisis-develop-safety-plan">suicide</a>.</li>



<li>Weight changes, including weight gain or weight loss.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the treatments for SAD?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Light therapy</strong><br>Bright&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/light-therapy/about/pac-20384604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">light therapy</a>&nbsp;is considered an effective treatment for SAD. Research suggests that around half of people who use a bright light therapy box have good results in reducing symptoms.</p>



<p>It's essential to meet with a healthcare professional familiar with light therapy to determine the type of device needed to be effective, how to correctly set it up and the length of time required in front of a light box. They'll also help you if your skin or eyes are sensitive to light due to a medical condition or medication.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="761" height="433" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/01/Snap983-1.jpg" alt="a white woman sitting at a desk with a laptop computer and touching a small light therapy lamp used for SAD seasonal affective disorder" class="wp-image-292640" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/01/Snap983-1.jpg 761w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/01/Snap983-1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px"></figure></div>


<p>Generally, the light box should provide an exposure of 10,000 lux of light and emit as little UV light as possible. The typical recommendation is to use the light box within the first hour of waking up in the morning for 20–30 minutes. Light boxes emit either white or blue light, but the color doesn't make a difference.</p>



<p><strong>Medications</strong><br>Your healthcare professional may prescribe an antidepressant.</p>



<p><strong>Physical activity</strong><br>Research has shown that exercising for 20 minutes at least three days a week is similar to taking an antidepressant.&nbsp;Being active can help with serotonin production and boost your mood.&nbsp;Exercising outdoors&nbsp;during daylight hours increases its effectiveness in reducing symptoms.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong><br>CBT helps people learn how to manage their symptoms of depression or reduce their severity. Talk with your healthcare professional about CBT and how to find someone skilled in it for depression or anxiety.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What can I start doing before the onset of symptoms?</strong></h2>



<p>If you have SAD, there are preventive measures that you can put in place, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be physically active.</strong><br>Exercise helps relieve stress and anxiety. It's essential to&nbsp;stay active during winter, even if you're tempted to "hibernate."</li>



<li><strong>Get outside.</strong><br>Spend 15 to 20 minutes outside when the sun is out. If the weather allows, take a walk outside when the sun is at its peak. Sunlight helps adjust your body's internal clock.</li>



<li><strong>Make your environment bright.</strong><br>Open the window blinds and allow sunlight into your home. Sit near a window while at home or work.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritize sleep.</strong><br>Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, with the goal of getting seven to nine hours of&nbsp;restful sleep. Excessive napping and oversleeping beyond your typical schedule can disrupt your circadian rhythm.</li>



<li><strong>Stay connected to friends and family.</strong><br>SAD can lead to staying home and isolating. Engaging with friends, staying in a routine, and getting active at home and outside of the home are essential.</li>



<li><strong>Take care of your body and mind.</strong><br>Eat regular, healthy meals. Avoid drugs and alcohol, which can make depression worse. Manage stress with practices like deep breathing,&nbsp;mindfulness and meditation.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have a history of SAD, talk with your healthcare team about a plan to better manage your mood during the winter months.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.healthlocator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HealthLocator</a>, a new, free digital tool, launches today to help patients and families find hospitals that consistently provide high-quality care.</p>



<p>HealthLocator gathers national quality data into a single, easy-to-navigate tool that allows users to search by city, specialty, or hospital. With just a few clicks, people can compare hospitals based on performance and make more informed choices about their care.</p>



<p>"HealthLocator brings together existing external national quality data into one clear, trusted source to help people select a high-quality hospital for themselves or a loved one," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/documents/2019/09/12/20/18/gianrico-farrugia.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=D1B315B05A8056FE1FA32F1738D86AA50D18CFD7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gianrico Farrugia, M.D.</a>, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, Mayo Clinic has used a combination of publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/resources/hospital/overall-star-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical quality</a>, <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/ynj2-r877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital patient safety</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/77hc-ibv8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">associated infection</a> metrics, and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/research/consumer-assessment-healthcare-providers-systems/hospital-cahps-hcahps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patient experience</a> to inform and advance its own improvement initiatives.

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nursing/sections/overview/ovc-20461236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nurses</a> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, once again earned Magnet recognition, making this their seventh designation and reaffirming nearly 30 years of excellence in nursing. The <a href="https://www.nursingworld.org/organizational-programs/magnet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Nurses Credentialing Center's Magnet Recognition Program</a> distinguishes healthcare organizations that meet rigorous standards for nursing excellence. This credential is the highest national honor for professional nursing practice.</p>



<p>"This recognition belongs to every nurse and care team member who lives our values each day," says Sherry Wolf, chief nursing officer, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester. "Their compassion, collaboration and dedication make Mayo Clinic a place of hope and healing and reaffirm our place as a Category of One in delivering exceptional patient care."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The designation process first began in 1994, and Mayo Clinic in Rochester has maintained Magnet status since 1997, placing it among the top 1% of healthcare organizations worldwide to hold this honor for nearly thirty years. This distinction reflects the enduring commitment, skill and compassion of its nursing teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magnet-designated organizations are distinguished by their collaborative culture, where nurses are essential partners in delivering the highest quality of care and driving continuous innovation in professional practice. These organizations also foster a positive environment for staff and contribute to shaping the future of the nursing profession.</p>



<p>The redesignation process occurs every four years and requires a comprehensive application and an on-site visit to demonstrate nursing excellence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Patients with breast cancer now have more options when it comes to radiation treatments. The goal is to remove any remaining cancer cells following chemotherapy or surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In other situations, we use radiation if the cancer is more advanced, or spread to the lymph nodes," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Advancements in technology allow healthcare professionals to treat patients more safely. One technique called "prone positioning" reduces the chance of beams targeting other organs. For this procedure, patients lie on their stomachs.</p>



<p>"We take advantage of gravity, the breast pulls away from the body, and we can treat the breast without exposing the underlying lung and heart to unnecessary radiation," explains Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is cutting-edge. Unlike traditional radiation, this procedure delivers X-rays directly to the targeted area from multiple angles, allowing for higher, more effective doses.</p>



<p>"Before intensity-modulated radiation therapy, we were not able to conform the dose around the chest wall," says Dr. Vallow.</p>



<p>For patients undergoing radiation therapy, it's crucial to stay hydrated and try to sleep well to fight fatigue. It's also important to use sunscreen after treatment.</p>

<p>Washing your hands for 20 seconds with warm water and soap is simple yet effective. It can prevent 1 in 3 cases of diarrhea and 1 in 5 respiratory infections.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/allen-summer-v-m-d/bio-20055381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Summer Allen</a>, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic, says staying healthy means fewer missed days from school, work and activities.

<p>Twenty seconds. That's how long you should be using soap and water to wash your hands each time, says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>"Using that lather and that soap and that time to scrub between each of their fingers on the insides and the backsides of their hands, and taking time — not just one or two seconds — and then rinsing your hands off again," she says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to wash your hands</h2>



<p>There are some key times when you should wash your hands.</p>



<p>"When you're leaving the bathroom. Another important time would be if you cough or sneeze. We try to tell people to try to sneeze into your elbow or not into your hand," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>And when handling food like uncooked meat, poultry, seafood, flour and eggs, unwashed hands can spread germs and lead to foodborne illnesses.</p>



<p>"When you're touching and handling that food, it's important to wash your hands and wash surfaces when you're done so that you don't pick up one of those infections," she emphasizes.</p>



<p>If soap and water aren't available, hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol is a second choice.</p>



<p><strong>To properly wash your hands, follow these steps:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Wet your hands with clean, running water.</li>



<li>Apply any kind of soap, and lather well.</li>



<li>Rub your hands vigorously for at least 20 seconds. Remember to scrub all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, wrists, palms, between your fingers and under your fingernails.</li>



<li>Rinse well.</li>



<li>Use a clean towel to turn off the faucet and dry your hands.</li>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I've read so much about the health benefits of tracking my steps. But there's a lot of confusing information out there. How many is the right number? Are some "steps" better for you than others? Please help.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you're tracking steps with your phone, a smartwatch or an old-school pedometer, the result is the same: you'll have a good indicator of how much you're moving during the day. The best <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/tomorrows-cure-keeping-tabs-on-health-with-wearable-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">device </a>for you is the one you'll use. With many devices, you can set up alerts and goals that remind you to move. And that's what counts. The ultimate goal is to move 150 minutes per week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reaping the benefits</strong></h2>



<p>You're right about the health benefits of getting in your steps. Here's what&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-walking-is-a-step-toward-heart-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walking</a>&nbsp;can help you do:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Control your blood pressure.</li>



<li>Lose or maintain weight.</li>



<li>Improve balance and coordination.</li>



<li>Increase core strength.</li>



<li>Manage stress and improve mood by releasing endorphins.</li>



<li>Manage your diabetes.</li>



<li>Reduce the risk of a heart attack.</li>



<li>Reduce the risk of developing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/basics/definition/con-20031902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2 diabetes</a>.</li>



<li>Stay strong and active.</li>
</ul>



<p>Walking also has been shown to:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improve sleep.</li>



<li>Slow mental decline.</li>



<li>Lower the risk of dementia.</li>



<li>Reduce the risk of some cancers.</li>



<li>Help you lead a longer life.</li>



<li>Maintain independent living into older age.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you're on a medically assisted weight-loss journey, whether that's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-bypass-surgery/in-depth/weight-loss-surgery/art-20045334">bariatric surgery</a> or a GLP-1 drug, being physically active will help burn calories, build strength, maintain muscle mass and bone density, and promote sustainable weight loss. It also can help medications work better.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tracking steps</strong></h2>



<p>Is there a magic number of steps for reaping these health benefits? Not really. If you can get in 10,000 steps a day, great. Research has shown that 10,000 steps a day can lead to reductions in premature death, with a majority of that reduction happening between 4,000 and 8,000 steps. After 10,000, you'll still see benefits, but they start to plateau.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How you get your steps doesn't really matter. Walking has a cumulative effect on your body across your day. So whether you&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/why-dogs-are-good-for-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walk your dog&nbsp;</a>for 15 minutes in the morning and 15 minutes at night, go for a brisk 30-minute walk or spend an hour moving around the house or working in the yard, those steps all count.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting started</strong></h2>



<p>The best way to start tracking your steps is to take it slow and steady. Listen to your body — it will tell you whether you're trying to do too much. Work more steps into your day by parking farther away from entrances, walking in place while you're waiting for the timer on the microwave to go off, and making multiple trips to bring in packages rather than loading up in just one. You may want to consider getting a walking pad and use it while watching TV or doing food prep in the kitchen.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Setting the pace</strong></h2>



<p>When you're advised to go for a brisk walk, what does that mean? "Brisk" is different for everyone. The average walking speed to aim for is 3 to 3.5 mph, which a device can help you measure. If you can walk faster safely, great. However, walking slowly is better than not walking at all and will still give you the benefits of moving your body.</p>



<p>The talk test is an easy way to identify a proper intensity. If you're able to talk but find it difficult to carry on a full conversation, that's "brisk" for you. You may not be out of breath, but your breathing is definitely elevated. New research indicates that brisk walking can boost brain function and well-being, as well as physical health.</p>



<p>Even if you're able to get in a little bit of walking every day, your body responds to this exercise, and you gain the benefits.</p>

<p>Kenneth Adams understands the importance of love, resilience and family. After his wife's passing in 2022, Adams reconnected with a lifelong friend, whom he had known for nearly 50 years. Kenneth and Susan Kidd<em>&nbsp;</em>eventually fell in love, and they were committed to building a life together.</p>



<p>"We love to travel and spend time with family — we wanted our relationship to be an example for our grandchildren. And to us, marriage was the next step," Adams said.</p>



<p>While making plans for a wedding in early 2025, Kenneth became ill and was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/symptoms-of-sepsis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sepsis</a>. His complex condition required coordinated care, so the team at Mayo Clinic developed a plan: antibiotics administered intravenously every day for six weeks. Instead of staying in the hospital for the duration of the treatment, Kenneth's care team determined he was a candidate for Mayo Clinic's <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797">Advanced Ca</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/hospital-at-home/sections/overview/ovc-20551797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">re at Home </a>program.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Going home</strong></h2>



<p>Advanced Care at Home offers patients high-acuity care, delivered in the comfort of their home. With around-the-clock access, advanced technology and a dedicated in-home care team, patients receive comprehensive treatment while minimizing stress and disruption to daily life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"With Advanced Care at Home, we can treat, monitor and communicate with patients as we would in a hospital setting, without recreating the feeling of being in a hospital setting," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/maniaci-michael-j-m-d/bio-20054934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michael Maniaci</a>, director of Advanced Care at Home.</p>



<p>For Kenneth, receiving treatment at home allowed him to maintain his routine, enjoy meals and sleep without interruption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The program provided everything you would need in a hospital but with the comforts of home and closeness of family," Kenneth says. "They had the procedures down, the infrastructure and the systems in place — it was a dream come true."</p>



<p>As the end of his treatment neared and his strength improved, Kenneth and Susan began thinking about a wedding ceremony again.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A wedding between treatments</strong></h2>



<p>On May 19, 2025, Kenneth and Susan invited a pair of close friends and a pastor to their Ponte Vedra, Florida, home. The couple was married in their backyard, and just an hour after saying "I do," Kenneth received one of his daily treatments.</p>



<p>"Getting married was a goal for Mr. Adams, so as his care team, we made sure he could achieve that goal safely and on his terms," Dr. Maniaci says.</p>



<p>Kenneth credits Advanced Care at Home with making the wedding possible. He was discharged from the program a week later with no signs of sepsis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People heal better at home," he says. “I feel that I'm living proof of that. There was no burden on my family — the team handled everything – and by being at home, I could get married,” Kenneth says.</p>



<p>By late July, Kenneth was well enough to resume another passion: travel. A trip that had been postponed earlier in the year was back on the calendar as a honeymoon. Looking ahead, Kenneth is preparing for an annual family trip in October. He continues to live with purpose and gratitude.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I want to do what I can, while I can,” Kenneth says. "I can do so much more with my health restored."</p>
