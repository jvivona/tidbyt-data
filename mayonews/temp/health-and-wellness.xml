<p><strong>Editor's note:</strong>&amp;nbsp;<em>May is both Traumatic Awareness Month and Biking Month</em></p>



<p>Bicycling is a great way to stay active and enjoy the outdoors.

<p>Whether you're a pro or biking for fun, there are common injuries all cyclists might experience.</p>



<p>"The first one is a traumatic injury if somebody falls off a bike," says Dr. Kakar.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Common breaks from traumatic injury include wrist fractures.</p>



<p>"We also see overuse-type injuries. So, for example, we see patients where they're pressing on the brakes for too long, squeezing hard, putting pressure on their palm, and their hands sometimes fall asleep â€” called numbness and tingling," Dr. Kakar says.</p>



<p>He says it could be&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/carpal-tunnel-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20355603?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carpal tunnel syndrome</a>, a condition you don't want to ignore.</p>



<p>"If you have numbness and tingling in the fingers, it is something I wouldn't ignore because if you have carpal tunnel, we worry about that," Dr. Kakar explains. </p>



<p>The numbness and tingling can become permanent and result in the loss of muscle strength</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevent bike injuries</strong></h2>



<p>"There are simple preventive measures you can take," says Dr. Kakar. "Having thicker grips so you're not squeezing as hard can also help. Bike gloves help as well and sometimes puts your wrist in a better position than putting pressure on your palm."</p>

<p>Wildfires in parts of the Midwest are causing concerns about air quality, even far from the flames. Understanding how wildfire smoke affects health can help you take simple steps to stay safe.</p>



<p>Dr. Jesse Bracamonte, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, warns, "Smoke, in general, can affect anyone's health, particularly if they're in areas where wildfires are occurring. It can cause anything from eye irritation to respiratory infection; Generally, respiratory issues and difficulty breathing; even placing your heart at risk for cardiac strain."</p>



<p>He adds that the smoky conditions can be particularly worrisome for people with preexisting conditions. "Those most at risk include those with underlying cardiac issues or underlying pulmonary issues, such as asthma or COPD," he says.</p>

<p>Dr. Bracamonte advises keeping an eye on air quality measures in your area. "If certain levels are high, it's recommended that you stay indoors," he says. "Try to close up windows as much as possible. Try to make sure you have a central air conditioning system so that the air is circulated in your home appropriately."</p>



<p>Health effects of breathing in smoke may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Coughing</li>



<li>Trouble breathing normally</li>



<li>Stinging eyes</li>



<li>Scratchy throat</li>



<li>Runny nose</li>



<li>Irritated sinuses&nbsp;</li>



<li>Wheezing and shortness of breath</li>



<li>Chest pains</li>



<li>Headaches</li>



<li>Asthma attack</li>



<li>Tiredness&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fast heartbeat</li>
</ul>



<p>He says in some instances where the air quality is poor, you're at high risk and must go outdoors, you might consider the use of a respirator to avoid underlying lung injury.</p>

<p>Approximately half of the world's population lives in areas vulnerable to dengue fever, particularly in hot and humid tropical and subtropical climates.</p>



<p>"That's why you see it in parts of the world such as Southeast Asia, South America, the Caribbean, and even some parts of the southern U.S., around Florida and Louisiana.," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>The primary transmitter of dengue fever is the Aedes aegypti mosquito, known to bite during both day and night. About 1 in 4 people infected with the virus will experience symptoms ranging from mild to severe.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="700" height="394" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/CDC-image-of-an-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-which-carries-the-Zika-virus-16x9.jpg" alt="CDC image of an Aedes aegypti mosquito, can transmit dengue fever" class="wp-image-86611" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/CDC-image-of-an-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-which-carries-the-Zika-virus-16x9.jpg 700w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/03/CDC-image-of-an-Aedes-aegypti-mosquito-which-carries-the-Zika-virus-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">An infected Aedes aegypti mosquito can transmit several viruses, including dengue fever.</figcaption></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Symptoms of dengue fever</strong></h2>



<p>"They usually notice fevers, body aches, bone aches, muscle aches; many times, they even describe an aching behind their eyes. They can get some nausea, vomiting and even diarrhea," Dr. Rizza says.</p>



<p>While most people recover within about a week, severe cases can lead to life-threatening emergencies.</p>



<p>Symptoms of severe dengue fever may include:</p>



<p>â€¢ Severe stomach pain.<br>â€¢ Persistent vomiting.<br>â€¢ Bleeding from your gums or nose.<br>â€¢ Blood in your urine, stool or vomit.<br>â€¢ Bleeding under the skin, which might look like bruising.<br>â€¢ Difficult or rapid breathing.<br>â€¢ Fatigue.<br>â€¢ Irritability or restlessness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>Unfortunately, there is no medicine to treat dengue fever.</p>



<p>"There's no antiviral or no treatment for dengue fever," she says. "It's what we call supportive therapy. Maintaining good hydration, particularly as people are sick and having fevers, is important. They can use acetaminophen to take care of the fevers, bring down the temperature, and then ensure they take in fluids and still get some form of eating."</p>



<p>"If they become severely ill and aren't able to keep up with their fluid status, they should go to their hospital and may require hospitalization to help support them," says Dr. Rizza.</p>



<p>Though there is no direct treatment, a vaccine is approved in many countries for children ages 9-16 who have previously shown evidence of dengue infection. Dr. Rizza says the vaccine is not approved in the U.S.</p>



<p>"You give it to people who have already had immunologic evidence of a previous dengue infection, and then you give it to them to help prevent them from becoming reinfected," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>



<p>Preventing mosquito bites is vital to avoiding dengue fever. Here are some strategies:</p>



<p>â€¢ Use bug spray with DEET, picaridin or oil of lemon eucalyptus to prevent mosquito bites.<br>â€¢ Remove any stagnant water where mosquitoes can lay eggs.<br>â€¢ Eliminate items that hold water, such as vases and flowerpot saucers.<br>â€¢ Ensure intact window screens and closed doors to keep mosquitoes outside.<br>â€¢ Wear protective clothing such as long sleeves and pants.</p>



<p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is responsible for several viral infections, including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and Zika.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I was recently diagnosed with advanced-stage endometriosis and I am told I need to have surgery. I still want children someday â€” should I be worried about my future fertility? What else should I know about recovering from surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;As you are learning, endometriosis is a condition in which tissue that is similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus.&nbsp;It can cause <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-to-seek-care-for-pelvic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious pain</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With advanced-stage&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-the-answer/">endome</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-the-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">t</a><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-when-surgery-for-endometriosis-is-the-answer/">riosis</a>&nbsp;and things such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/uterine-fibroids/symptoms-causes/syc-20354288" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uterine fibroids</a>&nbsp;and large&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ovarian-cysts/symptoms-causes/syc-20353405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ovarian cysts</a>, we do our best to minimize the negative effects on fertility and instead actually optimize for pregnancy. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/myomectomy/about/pac-20384710" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myomectomy</a>&nbsp;for uterine preservation, for example, allows women to maintain their uterus, even with large fibroids. Similarly, removing endometriosis but leaving the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries intact ensures there is still the possibility of future pregnancy and can even promote a successful pregnancy. Even when large, endometriosis-filled cysts are present (endometriomas), we are able to remove the abnormal tissue but leave the normal, healthy ovarian tissue in place for future fertility and hormonal needs.</p>

<p>The&amp;nbsp;biggest question I get from patients after surgery is, "When can I get back to life?" Patients have families, jobs or responsibilities outside of their own health. We know that women especially can struggle with that balance of taking care of themselves while also taking care of everyone around them. Understanding what those constraints are from a personal perspective and getting women back to their lives as quickly as possible are among the key things that we focus on.</p>



<p>The best recommendation I have for anyone going into surgery is to be the healthiest you that you can be. The less&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/basics/stress-basics/hlv-20049495">stress</a>&amp;nbsp;you have, the better your&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-blog/hlv-20049477?p=1">diet</a>&amp;nbsp;is and the more&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379">rest</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&amp;nbsp;that you've been getting is all going to support your body through the stress of surgery, which in turn is going to help speed along the recovery. The other thing I always make sure my patients are aware of is that, after surgery, be prepared to need some assistance doing daily things until the pain and fatigue lifts. It's normal to need a bit of help, so be prepared for that.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The advances that we've had in technology when it comes to surgical procedures have pushed the envelope and allowed us to do the majority of gynecologic procedures through a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/minimally-invasive-surgery/about/pac-20384771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimally invasive</a>&nbsp;approach. This means most patients are back at work a couple of weeks after surgery, depending on the procedure, but have a speedy recovery because we're not negatively affecting their bodies any more than necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The other thing to keep in mind from a recovery perspective is not every surgery is the same. There are some surgical procedures where the total downtime is only the day of surgery. In contrast, if we're doing something such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/abdominal-hysterectomy/multimedia/types-of-hysterectomy-surgery/img-20007786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hysterectomy</a>&nbsp;to remove the uterusâ€” even if it's done through small incisions â€” we want to ensure that healing happens well. So we don't want any heavy lifting or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise-intensity/art-20046887#:~:text=Vigorous%20aerobic%20exercise%20includes%20activities,for%20health%20and%20fitness%20benefits." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strenuous exercise</a>&nbsp;for typically six weeks after surgery. However, we do want normal physical activity to start even the day of surgery because that really helps maintain strength and normal body function, which helps speed along the recovery.</p>



<p>My team and I like to&nbsp;develop a close relationship with our patients to make sure that we know what their fertility goals are for the future and any barriers that might potentially stand in that way. Talk to your healthcare team about any other concerns, and best wishes to you during this time.&nbsp;<em>â€”&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/wasson-megan-n-d-o/bio-20234473" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Megan Wasson, D.O</strong></a><em><strong>., Gynecology, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</strong></em></p>

<p>Each year, more than 2 million children are seen in the emergency department in the U.S. because of fall-related injuries.</p>



<p>"The injuries can vary widely, and it's somewhat dependent on the age range for the patient," says Halada.</p>



<p>Infants and toddlers often get hurt tumbling off beds and changing tables. Windows and stairs can also lead to unintentional bumps and bruises.</p>



<p>"One way to prevent falls around the home would be to make sure that you have properly installed safety gates for your stairs and guards for the window," explains Halada.</p>



<p>Bigger kids sometimes end up at the hospital because of injuries related to biking, roller-skating and other recreational activities.</p>



<p>"Participation in any activity, you would want to make sure that the child is wearing correct and properly sized protective equipment, such as helmet, knee pads, elbow guards, wrist guards," says Halada.</p>



<p>Vigilant adult supervision can help reduce falls and accidents in children.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Preventing pediatric falls</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Move furniture away from windows to prevent climbing.</li>



<li>Strap babies in high chairs, swings and strollers.</li>



<li>Never leave a child alone in a shopping cart.</li>



<li>Keep windows locked and closed when not in use.</li>



<li>Create safe play areas.</li>



<li>Childproof home.</li>



<li>Always supervise young children.</li>

<p>According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)</a>, more than 700 confirmed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/symptoms-causes/syc-20374857" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">measles</a> cases have been reported in at least 25 states as of mid-April â€” and that number continues to grow. Most cases are among people who are unvaccinated, have an unknown vaccination status or are children. The highly contagious disease can lead to serious complications and hospitalizations, and two deaths have already been confirmed.</p>



<p>As awareness of the measles outbreak spreads, many Americans are asking questions and reassessing their vaccination status. Now may be a good time to brush up on the basics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who's at risk?</strong></h2>



<p>Anyone can get measles, especially if they are unvaccinated. You don't even have to come face-to-face with someone who has it to be infected. Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases and is highly transmissible. It spreads through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes, and it can infect others up to two hours after the sick person has left a room.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Measles symptoms and complications</strong></h2>



<p>Common symptoms of measles include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fever</li>



<li>Dry cough</li>



<li>Runny nose</li>



<li>Conjunctivitis (red, watery eyes)</li>



<li>White spots inside the mouth</li>



<li>A rash made up of large, flat spots and small raised bumps that start on the face or neck and spread down the body</li>
</ul>



<p>Complications from measles can include pneumonia, encephalitis (brain infection), airway inflammation and diarrhea leading to dehydration. Some complications may be severe and result in death. Becoming infected during pregnancy can result in premature delivery, stillbirth, miscarriage or birth defects. Those who are at increased risk for developing complications are children under the age of 5, people over age 20, pregnant women and people with a weakened immune system.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Prevention and vaccines</strong></h2>



<p>Vaccination is the safest and most effective way to prevent measles. The measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine plays a vital role in safeguarding the health of patients, staff and communities.</p>



<p>The CDC recommends that children receive two doses of the MMR vaccine: the first dose at 12 to 15 months of age, and the second between 4 and 6 years old. In some cases, the second dose may be given earlier, based on guidance from the child's primary care clinician. Full vaccination with two doses is on average 97% effective at preventing measles illness. The combined measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella (MMRV) vaccine also provides excellent protection. Varicella is better known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chickenpox/symptoms-causes/syc-20351282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chickenpox</a>. Parents can consult with their child's physician about which vaccine is best for their child.</p>



<p>Measles was declared eradicated from the U.S. in 2000 through a successful vaccine program; however, according to the CDC, a decline in vaccination rates among the nation's kindergartners over the past several years has contributed to measles outbreaks.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic stands behind the evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the vaccination schedules outlined by the CDC.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Measles in adults </strong>&amp;nbsp;<strong></strong></h2>



<p>According to the CDC, if you had the vaccine as a child or if you ever had the measles, you are protected for life and do not need a booster vaccine. If you don't have proof of immunity, you might need a vaccine. If you are unsure of your vaccination status, check with your healthcare team.</p>



<p><strong>Treatment</strong></p>



<p>There are no effective antiviral treatments for measles. Vitamin A can reduce the risk of complications from measles infection, especially among people who are vitamin A deficient. If you or your child are diagnosed with measles, your healthcare team may recommend you take vitamin A. Keep in mind that this vitamin does not prevent measles infection and taking high doses without the supervision of a healthcare professional is dangerous and can result in liver failure and death. Taking too much vitamin A during pregnancy can result in serious birth defects.</p>



<p>Read more about the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/measles/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20374862" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosis and treatment</a> of measles.</p>



<p><strong>What you can do now</strong></p>



<p>Verify with your healthcare team that everyone in your family is up to date with their measles vaccines. This is especially important if you are planning to travel internationally or to an area in the U.S. that is affected by the outbreaks.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&amp;nbsp;</strong>I'll admit I tend toward negative self-talk, and I'm frequently stressed out about work, family and health concerns. I know other people have problems too, but I feel like they handle it better. What can I do to help myself and be a role model for my children?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Resilient people are made, not born. There isn't a gene or a personality trait for resiliency. It's a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/resilience-training/in-depth/resilience/art-20046311">skill you can practice and strengthen</a>, just as you would a muscle. Becoming more resilient is something you can develop at any age or phase of life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Building resiliency<br></h2>



<p><strong>Identify three good things at the beginning or end of your day.</strong><br>These don't have to be huge. For most people, positive events are in the low- to moderate-size range, like running into a friend at the store, finding a forgotten dollar in a pocket or learning that the weird noise in your car only required a quick and inexpensive fix.</p>



<p>What matters isn't the intensity of positive experiences; it's the frequency of recognizing them.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>This exercise helps train our brains to&amp;nbsp;pay more attention to the positive. Try identifying three good things every day for two weeks, and you'll automatically begin recognizing those positive kernels.</p>



<p><strong>Practice gratitude</strong>.<br>Ask yourself, "Who or what am I grateful for?" Once again, this is more than just big things because it's easy to forget all the&nbsp;small things you appreciate.</p>



<p>A study conducted among nuns asked them to count their blessings rather than burdens. They were divided into two groups. One kept a daily journal of their blessings; the other was the control group. Researchers found that the nuns who expressed more gratitude lived up to a decade longer than those in the control group.</p>



<p>To practice this resiliency skill, regularly jot down what you're grateful for or send someone a gratitude letter, email or text.</p>



<p><strong>Try something different</strong>.<br>Your brain loves novelty and the new. Notice the new playground equipment at the park or take a different route to the store. At the store, pick up an item&nbsp;you've never tried before.</p>



<p><strong>Spend time in nature</strong>.<br><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-prescribing-nature-for-mental-physical-health/">Nature</a>&nbsp;is full of novelty. Notice the beauty around you: what's in the sky above, the bark patterns on a tree and how light streams through clouds after a storm. Try spending five minutes outdoors and mentally noting what you see, smell, hear and feel.</p>



<p><strong>Focus on what you can control</strong>.<br>You're stuck in traffic. There's nothing you can do about the fender bender that just happened ahead of you. Do you get all worked up? Or do you take deep breaths to tamp down the stress and evaluate the situation? Are you in danger? No. Are you going to miss a flight? Probably not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is there an exit ahead you can take? Yes. Is this a tragedy or an inconvenience? Inconvenience. Will this matter 10 days from now? No.</p>



<p>Focus on what&amp;nbsp;you can control:&amp;nbsp;your reaction to the situation.</p>



<p><strong>Foster relationships</strong>.<br>Relationships are essential to resiliency. You can connect with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/friendships/art-20044860">friends</a>&nbsp;and family for different reasons. It's these people who you value and who value you. They're the ones who will be there for you when faced with the challenges of life, both large and small.</p>



<p><strong>Be mindful.</strong><br><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/mindfulness-exercises/art-20046356">Mindfulness&nbsp;</a>is focusing on the moment and paying attention. But being mindful is tough. The brain is easily hijacked from the now by thoughts of the past and future and judgmental thoughts about ourselves and others.</p>



<p>The next time you're in a conversation and your mind starts wandering off to what you'll say in response, pull your attention back to the speaker.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>You don't need to tackle all these strategies at once. Pick one and play around with it.</p>



<p>Strengthening your resiliency muscle is a journey. Working on this skill throughout your life can help you grow. It's also a skill you can&amp;nbsp;teach children&amp;nbsp;and set them up to be more resilient as they face the ups and downs of life. â€”&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/rosean-bishop-lp"><strong><em>Rosean Bishop, Ph.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Psychiatry &amp;amp; Psychology</em></strong><strong>,&amp;nbsp;<em>Mayo Clinic Health System,&amp;nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato"><strong><em>Mankato</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Editor's note:</strong> April 16 is National Healthcare Decisions Day</em></p>



<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;My mom recently sat us down at the dinner table to talk about her wishes if something were to happen to her. She says we should all have <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-creating-an-advance-directive-for-your-future-well-being/">advance directives</a> made, but I feel like I'm too young to think about that. Who should have an advance directive? And what goes into it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Kudos to your family for having those difficult conversations.&amp;nbsp;Advance care planning is not just for elderly people or those with critical illnesses. We encourage&amp;nbsp;everyone who is over 18 to think about completing an&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/consumer-health/in-depth/living-wills/art-20046303">advance directive</a>, which is a document that allows you to write out what your preferences are when you're getting to the end of life.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>There are usually two parts to an advance directive:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li>The healthcare surrogate form, which will allow you to write down who would help you make medical decisions if you can't make them for yourself. It usually allows you to put a first person and an alternate person as well.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>The second piece is a living will, which allows you to write what your wishes are at the end of life. You can indicate whether you want medical interventions that could artificially prolong your life if you have a terminal condition or are in a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coma/symptoms-causes/syc-20371099">vegetative state</a>.&amp;nbsp;You mark yes or no.</li>
</ol>



<p>When thinking about care are at the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/end-of-life/basics/endoflife-care/hlv-20049403">end of life</a>, many people will say that quality of life for them is being able to engage and interact with family and do some of the things they love, not being on machines and tubes. Other people may say that quality of life for them is just being alive.</p>



<p>When you think about choosing your designated healthcare surrogate (the person who will make medical decisions for you) make sure the person knows enough about your medical condition and is aware of the available treatments and what state your condition is in. You also want to make sure this person would be comfortable making the decision you want them to make.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Once you've completed a living will and have chosen your healthcare surrogates, make sure these people know you have chosen them, what your wishes are and where the document is. You should also give a copy of the document to your healthcare team and hospital.</p>



<p>In the U.S. in general, we don't do a good job at completing advance directives. Most people don't want to talk about their care at the end of life. There is a notable difference, however, in the completion of advance directives between Black people and white people, specifically older people. The medical literature suggests that African Americans are less likely to complete advance directives because of several things:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Culture.</strong>&amp;nbsp;If the elders in the family don't want to talk about advance care planning, it oftentimes won't be discussed.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Lack of information.</strong>&amp;nbsp;African Americans are less likely to get information about advance care planning compared to white people.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li><strong>Spiritual beliefs.</strong>&amp;nbsp;"If God is in control, why do I need to think about this?"</li>



<li><strong>Mistrust.</strong>&amp;nbsp;There is an understandable mistrust of the healthcare system given the injustices that have occurred in the past and are still occurring.</li>
</ol>



<p>We often talk about the fact that we want people to complete an advance directive to ensure that their wishes are known when they are at the end of life, but in some minority communities, particularly the Black community, it's less about the individual person and more about what's best for the community or family.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>None of us really know when something serious may occur. Unfortunately, once people become&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/critical-care/sections/conditions-treated/orc-20399557">critically ill</a>, it's a difficult time to take a step back and think about their wishes, so it's good to have had these conversations before that happens. Think of it as a gift to your family members, your loved ones and your healthcare surrogates to be able to sit down with you when you're clear and levelheaded so that you can engage in conversations about what your wishes are to bring you all peace of mind.&amp;nbsp;<em>â€”&amp;nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/robinson-maisha-t-m-d/bio-20178228"><strong><em>Maisha Robinson, M.D</em></strong></a><strong><em>., Neurology and Internal Medicine,</em></strong>&amp;nbsp;<em><strong>Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I catch myself constantly nagging my kids and spouse to put down their devices during dinner, in the evenings and on weekends. I feel burned out by screens by the end of the workday. How can I encourage tech-free time for my family and reduce <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-much-screen-time-is-too-much-time-for-your-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">screen time</a>?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Smartphones,&amp;nbsp;gaming systems and screens&amp;nbsp;are everywhere. They are in our homes, bedrooms, offices, vehicles, pockets and purses. While these electronics can be helpful and entertaining, the amount of time we spend on them also can become a problem.</p>



<p>Consider this: When using a device, you disengage with something else. Is that something else important to you? Perhaps it's a child, a significant other, exercise, your job, chores or hobbies.</p>



<p>Many people feel like something is missing in life. Perhaps it's an unidentified desire to live life more fully. Reducing screen time frees up more time to connect with family and friends.&amp;nbsp;Feeling connections with others&amp;nbsp;can help ward off symptoms of stress,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007">depression</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anxiety/symptoms-causes/syc-20350961">anxiety</a>. We often miss out on the fun and beauty happening around us because of screens. By being present and in the moment â€” perhaps by setting aside a device â€” you may find what you need to fill that void.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are many wellness benefits to cutting down on screen time, including these four:</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Improve your physical health</h3>



<p>You know that physical activity is good for your health, but device use could reduce your exercise time. Maintaining healthy habits can be hard when you spend lots of time using screens.&amp;nbsp;Benefits include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Preventing&amp;nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">obesity</a><strong>&amp;nbsp;and conditions related to excess weight</strong>. This includes conditions include&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193">type 2 diabetes</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118">heart disease</a>.Children who watch more TV&amp;nbsp;have a greater risk of becoming overweight.</li>



<li><strong>Freeing more time for exercise and play</strong>. You can add&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389">physical activity</a>&amp;nbsp;to fill the new gaps in your schedule.</li>



<li><strong>Increasing your amount of sleep</strong>. Children who watch more TV tend to have more difficulty falling or staying asleep. They can feel tired and snack more often to make up for lost hours of sleep.</li>



<li><strong>Reducing mindless snacking which can lead to weight gain</strong>. Snacking or eating meals in front of the TV can lead to&amp;nbsp;mindless eating, which can result in consuming larger portions. Eliminating distractions allows you to pay more attention to your body and its signals when you're full.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Free up time to have fun playing and exploring</h3>



<p>Exploring and learning about the world is an integral part of life. Children are naturally curious, but adults can explore too. Instead of spending time on devices, you and your family can try new activities. Go for a bike ride, take a walk, visit a park, check out the museum or explore a local nature trail. Activities that don't involve screens can be as exciting as what is on them. Try&amp;nbsp;coloring, reading, crafting or other activities that use your imagination. Decreasing screen time allows more time for play and creative activities.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Make social connections</h3>



<p>Connecting with others is crucial for us to feel cared for. Children look to their caregivers for this sense of belonging; adults may find it within their families and friends. Devices can damage these relationships.</p>



<p>When parents engage with a screen, children may feel they need to compete for attention. When you set down your device, you are more emotionally available and can help&amp;nbsp;strengthen the family bond.</p>



<p>One study found that children who went without electronic devices for five days were better at recognizing facial emotions and reading nonverbal cues than those who lived life as usual. Less screen time can result in better face-to-face social skills. Having a TV on, even as background noise, will direct your focus to it rather than what is happening around you.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Boost your mood</h3>



<p>Putting down your phone and going outside or doing an enjoyable activity can be a mood booster. It can make you feel more accomplished and improve your well-being. Depression and anxiety can cause a person to withdraw and isolate themselves from others.&amp;nbsp;Engaging in social activities&amp;nbsp;helps you connect with others and reduce symptoms of these conditions. Children who spend more time looking at a screen are more likely to have behavioral problems and divided attention; decreasing screen time can improve their focus. Violence in media may cause kids to feel anxious and depressed and lead them to think that violence is an acceptable way to deal with problems.</p>



<p>While technology is a great tool, it also can hinder your wellness and make you feel disconnected from those around you. Taking a break from devices frees up more time to be active and enjoy time with loved ones.

<p>The liver is the largest internal organ of the body. It is essential for metabolism, digesting food and ridding the body of toxic substances. Liver failure can happen quickly, or over time.</p>



<p>"Once liver disease advances, the only way we can reverse the process and give the patient their life back is by replacing the liver, " says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>When patients become a candidate for a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">liver transplant</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/liver-transplant/home/orc-20211818" target="_blank">,</a> they are added to a waitlist. Unfortunately, there are more people waiting for a liver than there are available organs.</p>



<p>"As the patient is waiting on the list, they usually are anxiously waiting for that call when a donor becomes available. And that's what we call the deceased donor liver transplantation."</p>



<p>Another option is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/living-donor-transplant/about/pac-20384787?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank">living liver transplant</a>. It's a major surgery where a person donates two-thirds of his or her liver. Donors needs to go through an extensive evaluation to make sure they can donate safely.</p>



<p>"A healthy liver is able to regenerate, and you will be surprised to know that with living donor liver transplantation, both segments of the liver will grow back to almost the normal size within 90 days after transplantation."</p>



<p>Being a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/living-donor-transplantation-evaluation/gnc-20505893?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/living-donor-transplantation-evaluation/gnc-20505893?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">living organ donor</a> may not be an option for everyone, but there are ways to people can sign up to be an organ donor. It can be as easy as checking a box on your driver's license.</p>



<p>"Donating your organs is really donating the gift of life to people who are in urgent need for organ transplantation," Dr. Aqel says.</p>

<p><strong>For the safety of its patients, staff and visitors, Mayo Clinic has strict masking policies in place.&amp;nbsp;Anyone shown without a mask was either recorded prior to COVID-19 or recorded in a nonpatient care area where social distancing and other safety protocols were followed.</strong></p>
