<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>In the past few years, my mom passed away, and I lost a dear friend. The holidays were always a special time for us. Since their deaths, the holidays are really hard. Do you have any suggestions for managing this grief?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;The holiday season can be especially challenging if you're mourning the death of someone close to you. Whether it was a recent loss or one that occurred some time ago, feelings of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/complicated-grief/symptoms-causes/syc-20360374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grief</a> can be heightened and may seem overwhelming during the holiday season.</p>



<p>This is the time of year known for traditions and togetherness with family and friends, yet you may face challenges in how you celebrate and gather. Understanding&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-space-in-between-grief-and-growth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how grief affects you</a>, having conversations about plans with those close to you, and finding ways to remember your loved ones can help restore a sense of balance. These choices also can help you navigate through rough spots and find warmth in special, unexpected places.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Experiencing grief emotionally, physically</strong></h2>



<p>Grief and bereavement are universal human responses to loss. How each person processes their symptoms and reactions varies greatly. Because all people are different, how and when those feelings surface are also different. There's no predictable timetable or pattern.</p>



<p>While you may feel it on an emotional level or in your everyday activities or relationships, grief also can have physical effects. These can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Tiring more easily or low energy.</li>



<li>Having trouble eating or sleeping.</li>



<li>Seeming more susceptible to headaches and other illnesses.</li>



<li>Having trouble concentrating or focusing.</li>



<li>Having low tolerance.</li>
</ul>



<p>You're not imagining these reactions. They're real.</p>



<p>Some of what you're experiencing may include responses that don't feel socially acceptable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You might find that tears come easily in unexpected places or you can't cry — the tears just won't come. You might feel so down or exhausted that you have trouble just getting out of bed or off the sofa. You might realize that the coping responses you've developed might not be the healthiest.</p>



<p>The important thing is to honor your process and acknowledge that this is how you respond and how you're coping. There is no right or wrong way to grieve. Go at your own pace.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Seeking help to navigate the holidays</strong></h2>



<p>Pay close attention to your health and take good care of yourself while grieving. It's important to be gentle with yourself. Try to&nbsp;eat healthy foods&nbsp;and get enough rest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you're experiencing these symptoms, it's a good idea to consult with your healthcare team to ensure that all is well physically and to receive additional emotional guidance during this difficult time.</p>



<p>It may be beneficial to seek grief counseling or join a grief support group. Knowing that you're not alone can make a world of difference. Connecting with those who understand or are going through a similar situation can provide new perspectives and affirm that what you're going through is normal.</p>



<p>Sharing stories among family and friends, making favorite foods, looking at photographs of happy times, or other activities may help you find connection. But pay attention to whether this helps or becomes too much to handle. Let your feelings be your guide. Finding the path to navigate through all the&nbsp;season's activities&nbsp;may provide a sense of empowerment.</p>



<p>You're grieving because you've loved, have been loved and continue to love. An important part of your healing this holiday season may be to embrace the love and memories you've shared with your loved ones.</p>



<p>Wishing you peace through the holiday season.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new year offers new beginnings and an opportunity to reset your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/hlv-20049477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eating habits</a> after the holidays. <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-make-healthy-holiday-food-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea Delgado</a>,&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> dietitian, says it's best to eliminate what you don't need, including party food leftovers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your refrigerator is holding onto less-than-healthy holiday leftovers into the new year, it is OK to let them go. Dispose of leftovers or eat them gradually and in smaller&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1">por</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tions</a>, Delgado advises.</p>



<p>"You want to slowly regress back to your old healthier habits or establish new ones. Start introducing vegetables and fruits with most meals," Delgado says.</p>



<p>And pay attention to portion sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"You don't necessarily have to go on a diet. You don't necessarily have to eliminate treats. Instead, look at the portion sizes and how often you have those foods," she says.</p>



<p>Opt for lean protein, whole grains and fresh produce in your diet, still allowing for an occasional treat.</p>



<p>"With nutrition, there is no all or nothing. We can still enjoy those nice treats, those good desserts, those savory beverages. It's all in how much and how often we are having them,"&nbsp; Delgado says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Reset your eating habits with portion control</strong></h2>



<p>Simplify your portion control by dividing your plate into three sections. This can assist you in making healthier food choices and managing your portions more effectively.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables</li>



<li>One-quarter: whole grains</li>



<li>One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</li>
</ul>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="955" height="519" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/11/Kashmira-Chawla-M.D-in-Zambia-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Kashmira Chawla, M.D teaching in Zambia" class="wp-image-408287" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/11/Kashmira-Chawla-M.D-in-Zambia-16-x-9.jpg 955w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/11/Kashmira-Chawla-M.D-in-Zambia-16-x-9-300x163.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/11/Kashmira-Chawla-M.D-in-Zambia-16-x-9-768x417.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Kashmira Chawla, M.D., teaching in Zambia</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Lusaka, Zambia, where clinical improvisation is often essential, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> anesthesiologist Kashmira Chawla, M.D., led a group of senior residents from&nbsp;<a href="https://college.mayo.edu/academics/residencies-and-fellowships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education</a>&nbsp;(MCSGME) on a collaborative expedition to improve airway management and perioperative care.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Supported by a scholarship from the Mayo Clinic Global Health Program, Dr. Chawla and her trainees spent a month working with Zambian clinicians so they could both teach and perform a life-saving procedure called awake fiberoptic intubation. This procedure helps doctors safely place a breathing tube in patients with difficult airways. But in Zambia, the team had only one donated scope and limited medications. To make the procedure work, they had to get creative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead of using standard equipment like nebulizers to numb the throat, they used a syringe and a small catheter to deliver lidocaine, a numbing agent, to the area. Only one concentration of lidocaine was available, so they adjusted their technique to make it effective. Once the breathing tube was in place, they used ketamine to induce anesthesia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Collaboration and cultural exchange</strong></h2>



<p>Without electronic medical records or a formal scheduling system, the team used WhatsApp to coordinate with surgeons and identify patients who needed special airway care. They often met patients for the first time in the preoperative holding area on the day of surgery, relying on paper charts and patient interviews to prepare. And because of limited staffing, residents proactively tracked and gathered supplies to prevent delays from happening during surgical procedures.</p>



<p>"We weren't just applying what we knew," Dr. Chawla says. "We were learning from our Zambian colleagues, who navigate these challenges every day with incredible skill and creativity."</p>



<p>One moment stood out during a busy surgical day. A patient arrived with a large mass obstructing the nose and throat, and the team had limited monitoring tools. A Zambian resident explained a plan using calm coaching and culturally sensitive care, recalls Dr. Chawla, and the Mayo team asked questions to better understand the local approach. This led to a successful procedure and a meaningful exchange of ideas, with both teams sharing strategies and learning from each other.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building partnerships with lasting global impact</strong></h2>



<p>The rotation was designed to be a two-way exchange: Mayo residents taught bedside techniques and led simulation training sessions using high-fidelity mannequin simulators. Zambian clinicians shared their expertise in adapting care to local conditions. The team also used a problem-solving model called SEIPS (Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety) to study how the hospital's systems worked and find ways to improve them.</p>



<p>The project was supported by the Office of Health Equity and Inclusion (OHEI), which helps ensure that Mayo's global health efforts are respectful, inclusive and sustainable. "OHEI's support is vital to sustaining and expanding this work," Dr. Chawla says.</p>



<p>The team's work was recently published in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0007091225004052?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">British Journal of Anaesthesia</a>, first-authored by former MCSGME resident Jennifer Eller, M.D., giving international visibility to the collaboration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"It's a moment of reflection," Dr. Chawla says. "It reminds us that meaningful research can come from shared learning, humility and a commitment to improving care in different settings."</p>



<p>Plans are underway to continue the program and possibly expand it to other hospitals in low-resource areas. The team hopes to build on what they learned in Zambia and create training models that are tailored to each location's needs.</p>



<p>For Dr. Chawla, the experience was more than a professional milestone. It was a chance to live out the Mayo Model of Care in a new environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Global health is not just about outreach," she says. "It's about building something together that lasts."</p>



<p>The Mayo Clinic School of Graduate Medical Education (MCSGME) is one of the oldest and largest graduate medical education schools in the U.S. With more than 2,000 trainees, MCSGME is transforming the future of healthcare by preparing physicians and specialists to deliver high-quality, patient-centered care and lead in clinical innovation, education and research. The school offers 380 residency and fellowship programs across Mayo Clinic’s Minnesota, Florida and Arizona campuses and the Mayo Clinic Health System.</p>

<p><em>November is Diabetes Awareness Month</em></p>



<p>JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diabetes</a> affects how the body uses glucose, also known as blood sugar. It can mean that there is too much sugar in the blood. This can harm people in several ways. One serious complication is <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic kidney disease</a>. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/porter-ivan-e-ii-m-d/bio-20113830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ivan Porter II, M.D.</a>, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nephrology-hypertension/sections/overview/ovc-20464571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nephrologist</a> at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Florida, explains the connection between diabetes and chronic kidney disease.</p>



<p>Up to 40% of people with diabetes develop chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, <a href="https://diabetesatlas.org/resources/idf-diabetes-atlas-reports/diabetes-and-kidney-disease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global statistics show</a>. Their kidneys cannot effectively do their most important job, which is regulating the composition of the blood by filtering out waste and maintaining the balance and amount of salt and water in the body.</p>



<p>Chronic kidney disease may be advanced before symptoms appear and a person is diagnosed. It can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which can be fatal without <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/hemodialysis/about/pac-20384824" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-surgeon-living-kidney-donation-medical-advances-help-patients-avoid-dialysis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a>.</p>



<p>Both <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 1</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2</a> diabetes can lead to chronic kidney disease. Type 2 diabetes is a far more common cause. With either type, the body can't produce enough insulin. Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas that helps the body convert sugar into energy. Because one of the kidneys' most important jobs is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqsnI_PBKRI&amp;t=5s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cleaning the blood</a>, they help regulate blood glucose levels, Dr. Porter explains.</p>



<p>"The high levels of circulating glucose in the blood are poisonous to nerves and blood vessels, and the kidneys are a big ball of blood vessels," Dr. Porter says. "The presence of high glucose leads to chemical changes that cause protein in urine, and the presence of protein in urine directly activates factors that cause scarring and fibrosis within the kidney, leading to worsening of kidney disease."</p>



<p>How diabetes and chronic kidney disease overlap and interact with each other is complex. Too much glucose in the blood can damage the kidneys and lead to chronic kidney disease. At the same time, declining kidney function related to chronic kidney disease can lead to insulin resistance, which can cause type 2 diabetes. In addition, declining kidney function can worsen preexisting diabetes.</p>



<p>The longer you have diabetes — and the less controlled your blood sugar — the higher the risk of complications such as chronic kidney disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are five stages of kidney disease, based on the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/creatinine-test/about/pac-20384646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glomerular filtration rate</a> (GFR). The GFR measures how well the kidneys filter waste from the blood. The stages are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 1.</strong>&nbsp;At this stage, the GFR is 90 or higher, which is considered a healthy level. However, there is also another indicator of kidney disease present, such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/blood-in-urine/symptoms-causes/syc-20353432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/protein-in-urine/basics/causes/sym-20050656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protein in the urine</a>.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 2.</strong>&nbsp;At this stage, the GFR is 60 to 89.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 3.</strong>&nbsp;This stage is broken down into two subtypes — stage 3a and stage 3b. With 3a, the GFR is 45 to 59, and there is mild to moderate decline in kidney function. With 3b, the GFR is 30 to 44, and there is a more severe decline in kidney function.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 4.</strong>&nbsp;The GFR is 15 to 29, and kidney decline is severe.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Stage 5.</strong>&nbsp;This stage is considered <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/end-stage-renal-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">end-stage renal disease</a>, also called kidney failure. The GFR is under 15. At this point, dialysis or a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney transplant</a> is needed.</li>
</ul>



<p>Most often, chronic kidney disease is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-diagnosed-with-chronic-kidney-disease-now-what/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diagnosed</a> in stage 3 or later.</p>



<p>"The presence of other comorbidities, such as uncontrolled <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood pressure</a>, uncontrolled diabetes or the presence of protein in the urine, can make what might seem like an earlier stage worse for someone," Dr. Porter says.</p>



<p>Not everyone living with diabetes will develop chronic kidney disease. Dr. Porter says it is critical to manage your diabetes,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/kidney-disease/testing/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">monitor your kidney function regularly</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and take steps to protect your kidney health to help lower risk.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/in-depth/diabetes-management/art-20047963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Controlling diabetes</a> includes managing medication, developing a healthy eating routine, exercising and planning for factors that can affect blood sugar levels, such as illness, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/topics/support-your-mind" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a>, and changes in hormone levels due to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/womens-health/in-depth/menstrual-cycle/art-20047186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menstrual cycles</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/perimenopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20354666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">perimenopause</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/menopause/symptoms-causes/syc-20353397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause</a>.</p>



<p>Type 2 diabetes has risk factors that people can try to avoid. These include preventing or treating overweight or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>; being active; maintaining healthy levels of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/hdl-cholesterol/art-20046388" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDL cholesterol</a>, also known as good cholesterol; and avoiding <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/balancing-the-risks-benefits-of-alcohol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alcohol</a> or limiting consumption to a moderate level.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I know that <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a> can take a real toll on your body, but I didn't know that it includes your eyes. How are they affected by this disease?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong>While <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/basics/eye-care/hlv-20049421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eye care</a> and regular eye exams are important for everyone, they're particularly vital for people with diabetes.</p>



<p>Diabetes is a prevalent condition worldwide, affecting approximately 10% of the population. It's caused by a problem in the way the body regulates and uses sugar as fuel. Diabetes is a systemic disease, which means it affects many organs, including the heart, blood vessels, nerves, kidneys and eyes.</p>



<p>Let's explore why routine eye care is so important.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding diabetic retinopathy</strong></h2>



<p>The eye contains a sensitive layer called the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, which plays a vital role in your vision. The blood vessels in the retina can be affected by&nbsp;diabetes, leading to a condition known as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetic-retinopathy/symptoms-causes/syc-20371611" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetic retinopathy</a>. It can develop in anyone with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 1</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">type 2</a> diabetes.</p>



<p>It also can develop during pregnancy if you're diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/gestational-diabetes-what-to-know-during-pregnancy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gestational diabetes</a>. Having diabetes before becoming pregnant can increase your risk of diabetic retinopathy. Your healthcare professional might recommend additional eye exams throughout your pregnancy.</p>



<p>Diabetic retinopathy gradually damages the retina's blood vessels. As the condition becomes established, you may not notice any symptoms. But damage occurs even before symptoms appear, progressing through various stages of severity. There often are no symptoms until retinopathy has reached a moderate or advanced stage. In the advanced stage, diabetic retinopathy can cause rapid, permanent vision loss.</p>



<p>In people ages 25 to 74 worldwide, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of vision loss. By 2030, an estimated 191 million people globally will have this condition, and 56.3 million people with diabetes will have vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI-assisted software aids in diabetic retinopathy screening</strong></h2>



<p>For people with diabetes, regular eye screening is part of their annual exam with their primary care clinician.</p>



<p>Several AI devices for diabetic retinopathy screening were approved by the Food and Drug Administration. These systems capture an ocular photograph of the eye's retina to identify early signs of retinopathy. Taking this photograph is quick, and the process is designed for your comfort.</p>



<p>If the screening detects diabetic retinopathy, your healthcare team will refer you to retinal specialists or an ophthalmology specialist for further evaluation and management of the condition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Treating diabetic retinopathy</strong></h2>



<p>Prevention remains the best approach for diabetic retinopathy. Strict control of your&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/closing-the-loop-with-insulin-pumps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blood glucose</a>&nbsp;levels reduces your risk of developing vision loss from diabetic retinopathy. In addition, you should control high blood pressure and cholesterol, since they can affect the retinal health of your eyes. If you smoke, now's the time to stop.</p>



<p>Even if your annual eye exam showed no issues, it's crucial to report any of these symptoms to your healthcare team right away:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Blurred vision</li>



<li>Double vision</li>



<li>Dark or empty spot in the center of your vision</li>



<li>Difficulty reading</li>



<li>Difficulty seeing well at night</li>



<li>Droopy eyelid</li>



<li>Eye pain</li>



<li>Flashing lights</li>



<li>Halos around lights</li>



<li>Objects that look larger or smaller than usual</li>



<li>Sudden appearance of spots or floaters</li>
</ul>



<p>These symptoms may indicate that you need a change in your eyeglass or contact lens prescription. They also may signal other, more serious diseases, such as diabetic-related ocular complications, including diabetic retinopathy.</p>



<p>Early detection and diligent management by an ophthalmologist can slow the progression or halt diabetic retinopathy. A prompt diagnosis increases the chances of a favorable outcome.</p>

<p>Eight eligible <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> hospitals earned A grades from&nbsp;<a href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.leapfroggroup.org%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Clea.dan%40mayo.edu%7Ce9b1511dbd64401f8efa08dac7fac64c%7Ca25fff9c3f634fb29a8ad9bdd0321f9a%7C0%7C0%7C638042177219464262%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=7SE6Xv0d1MmAEt%2FcayEnYIrmYt4j6Zaba7mvAjgjsj8%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Leapfrog Group</a>, an independent national nonprofit organization that provides safety ratings.</p>



<p>All eight hospitals have maintained straight A’s since spring 2022. Notably, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Arizona</a> is among just 11 hospitals in the nation that have achieved an A in every Leapfrog grading cycle since 2012 — earning an all-time Straight A distinction from <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-hospitals-earn-highest-grades-for-patient-safety-from-leapfrog-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leapfrog</a>. The ratings are intended to help patients choose their preferred healthcare destinations.</p>



<p>"Dr. Charlie Mayo once said that teamwork&nbsp;—&nbsp;with each member doing their part in the spirit of cooperation&nbsp;—&nbsp;is what makes great medicine possible. These grades reflect that same spirit: teams working together to make safe, high-quality care our constant standard," says&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/dowdy-sean-c-m-d/bio-20054619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Dowdy, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic's chief value officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hospitals that received an A grade are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</li>



<li>Mayo Clinic in Florida.</li>



<li>Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</li>



<li>Mayo Clinic Health System in Albert Lea and Austin, Minnesota.</li>

<li>Mayo Clinic Health System in Fairmont, Minnesota.</li>



<li>Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse, Wisconsin.</li>



<li>Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato, Minnesota.</li>
</ul>



<p>Mayo Clinic Health System in Red Wing, Minnesota, received a B grade.</p>



<p>The Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Grades are updated and published twice each year. The grade is based on 22 measures of publicly available hospital safety data and self-reported survey answers, which are combined to produce a single safety grade. A panel of patient safety experts developed the measures for the grade.</p>



<p>Many agencies rate quality in healthcare. Mayo Clinic is the only healthcare organization that consistently ranks among the top providers nationwide, regardless of the quality measure used.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/about-mayo-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm that can identify <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obstructive-sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)</a> using the results from an electrocardiogram (ECG) – a common heart test. The innovation could make it faster, cheaper, and easier to spot sleep apnea, particularly in women, who are often underdiagnosed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A common but underrecognized condition</strong></h2>



<p>OSA affects more than 936 million adults ages 30-69 worldwide and poses significant cardiovascular risks. People with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-have-obstructive-sleep-apnea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OSA</a> experience repeated episodes of upper airway collapse or blockage during sleep. This collapse causes breathing to stop or become shallow repeatedly, which often leads to loud snoring and gasping. Despite its prevalence, it often goes undiagnosed.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of sleep apnea" class="wp-image-249304" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2019/09/sleep-apnea-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure>
</div>


<p></p>



<p>"Obstructive sleep apnea or OSA is a highly prevalent disease with important cardiovascular consequences," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/somers-virend-m-d-ph-d/bio-00027756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virend Somers, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Alice Sheets Marriott Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine and senior author of the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40961733/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in JACC: Advances. "OSA affects the heart to the point where AI algorithms can detect the OSA signature from the ECG, which in essence is a representation of the electrical activity of the heart muscle cells," Dr. Somers adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>AI model shows strong performance — especially for women</strong></h2>



<p>In the study, the researchers used AI algorithms to review the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) test results of 11,299 patients at Mayo Clinic who had undergone the test along with sleep evaluations. More than 7,000 of them had a known diagnosis of OSA, and 4,000 were controls.</p>



<p>"The most surprising finding was the increased visibility on the ECG of OSA in the females compared to the males, even though the OSA severity was less in the females," says Dr. Somers.</p>



<p>"This is relevant since emerging data consistently suggest that females have a greater relative likelihood of suffering the cardiovascular consequences of OSA, even if their OSA may be considered 'milder' by standard diagnostic criteria," he adds.</p>



<p>The test also strongly suggests women may suffer more damage to their heart muscle cells from OSA, Dr. Somers says.</p>



<p>Dr. Somers underscores that this approach may have the potential to evaluate whether a given OSA treatment may be able to reduce a patient's cardiovascular risk.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>I love the fall, but I dread the shorter days and how I feel. I've read about seasonal affective disorder, but could you please tell me more about it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seasonal affective disorder</a>, or&nbsp;SAD, is a type of depression that's related to the changes in seasons. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721#symptoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Symptoms</a> typically appear in the fall, worsen through the winter months and eventually go away in the spring or summer. The answers to these questions should help you better understand SAD and determine if you should seek care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the possible causes of SAD?</strong></h2>



<p>While the exact cause is unknown, it may be linked to reduced sunlight, which reacts with the natural chemicals in your body, like serotonin and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/melatonin-use-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melatonin</a>,&nbsp;that determine mood and energy levels and regulate sleep.</p>



<p>SAD isn't just a case of the&nbsp;winter blues, a condition that is milder and more common. SAD symptoms can make it difficult to function at home, work and in social settings.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Who is most at risk for experiencing symptoms of SAD?</strong></h2>



<p>People who live in the northern half of the U.S., where daylight hours are shorter and there's less sunlight, are at more risk. It's estimated that about 20% of people in this region could have symptoms of SAD. It's believed that SAD runs in families, and it's more common in women.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the symptoms of SAD?</strong></h2>



<p>Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder to watch for include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Difficulty concentrating.</li>



<li>Feeling persistently tired and fatigued, including feeling a loss of energy nearly every day of the affected months.</li>



<li>Feelings of worthlessness.</li>



<li>Losing interest in things you would typically enjoy, such as hobbies and social activities.</li>



<li>Persistently feeling down or sad.</li>



<li>Sleep disturbances, which could include hypersomnia (sleeping too much) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insomnia</a>&nbsp;(difficulty falling asleep).</li>



<li>Thoughts of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-crisis-develop-safety-plan">suicide</a>.</li>



<li>Weight changes, including weight gain or weight loss.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the treatments for SAD?</strong></h2>



<p><strong>Light therapy</strong><br>Bright&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/light-therapy/about/pac-20384604" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">light therapy</a>&nbsp;is considered an effective treatment for SAD. Research suggests that around half of people who use a bright light therapy box have good results in reducing symptoms.</p>



<p>It's essential to meet with a healthcare professional familiar with light therapy to determine the type of device needed to be effective, how to correctly set it up and the length of time required in front of a light box. They'll also help you if your skin or eyes are sensitive to light due to a medical condition or medication.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="761" height="433" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/01/Snap983-1.jpg" alt="a white woman sitting at a desk with a laptop computer and touching a small light therapy lamp used for SAD seasonal affective disorder" class="wp-image-292640" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/01/Snap983-1.jpg 761w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/01/Snap983-1-300x171.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px"></figure>
</div>


<p>Generally, the light box should provide an exposure of 10,000 lux of light and emit as little UV light as possible. The typical recommendation is to use the light box within the first hour of waking up in the morning for 20–30 minutes. Light boxes emit either white or blue light, but the color doesn't make a difference.</p>



<p><strong>Medications</strong><br>Your healthcare professional may prescribe an antidepressant.</p>



<p><strong>Physical activity</strong><br>Research has shown that exercising for 20 minutes at least three days a week is similar to taking an antidepressant.&nbsp;Being active can help with serotonin production and boost your mood.&nbsp;Exercising outdoors&nbsp;during daylight hours increases its effectiveness in reducing symptoms.</p>



<p><strong>Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</strong><br>CBT helps people learn how to manage their symptoms of depression or reduce their severity. Talk with your healthcare professional about CBT and how to find someone skilled in it for depression or anxiety.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What can I start doing before the onset of symptoms?</strong></h2>



<p>If you have SAD, there are preventive measures that you can put in place, including:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be physically active.</strong><br>Exercise helps relieve stress and anxiety. It's essential to&nbsp;stay active during winter, even if you're tempted to "hibernate."</li>



<li><strong>Get outside.</strong><br>Spend 15 to 20 minutes outside when the sun is out. If the weather allows, take a walk outside when the sun is at its peak. Sunlight helps adjust your body's internal clock.</li>



<li><strong>Make your environment bright.</strong><br>Open the window blinds and allow sunlight into your home. Sit near a window while at home or work.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritize sleep.</strong><br>Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, with the goal of getting seven to nine hours of&nbsp;restful sleep. Excessive napping and oversleeping beyond your typical schedule can disrupt your circadian rhythm.</li>



<li><strong>Stay connected to friends and family.</strong><br>SAD can lead to staying home and isolating. Engaging with friends, staying in a routine, and getting active at home and outside of the home are essential.</li>



<li><strong>Take care of your body and mind.</strong><br>Eat regular, healthy meals. Avoid drugs and alcohol, which can make depression worse. Manage stress with practices like deep breathing,&nbsp;mindfulness and meditation.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have a history of SAD, talk with your healthcare team about a plan to better manage your mood during the winter months.</p>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — <a href="https://www.healthlocator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HealthLocator</a>, a new, free digital tool, launches today to help patients and families find hospitals that consistently provide high-quality care.</p>



<p>HealthLocator gathers national quality data into a single, easy-to-navigate tool that allows users to search by city, specialty, or hospital. With just a few clicks, people can compare hospitals based on performance and make more informed choices about their care.</p>



<p>"HealthLocator brings together existing external national quality data into one clear, trusted source to help people select a high-quality hospital for themselves or a loved one," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/documents/2019/09/12/20/18/gianrico-farrugia.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=D1B315B05A8056FE1FA32F1738D86AA50D18CFD7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gianrico Farrugia, M.D.</a>, president and CEO of Mayo Clinic.</p>



<p>For more than a decade, Mayo Clinic has used a combination of publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/care-compare/resources/hospital/overall-star-rating" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">clinical quality</a>, <a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/ynj2-r877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hospital patient safety</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/dataset/77hc-ibv8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">associated infection</a> metrics, and <a href="https://www.cms.gov/data-research/research/consumer-assessment-healthcare-providers-systems/hospital-cahps-hcahps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patient experience</a> to inform and advance its own improvement initiatives. These same evidence-based measures are used to rate more than 5,000 U.S. hospitals featured in <a href="https://www.healthlocator.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HealthLocator</a>.</p>



<p>"HealthLocator offers a clear, evidence-based view of hospital quality that aligns with Mayo Clinic's primary value: the needs of the patient come first,"&nbsp;says Sean Dowdy, M.D., chief value officer for Mayo Clinic and the Robert D. and Patricia E. Kern Associate Dean for Practice Transformation.&nbsp;"By helping people make informed healthcare decisions, we're improving lives."</p>



<p>More information about HealthLocator’s methodology is available in <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.25.0296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New England Journal of Medicine Catalyst</a>.</p>



<p>Created for patients by those who serve them, HealthLocator is offered as a free public service. Users do not need to create an account, and there are no subscriptions.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/nursing/sections/overview/ovc-20461236" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nurses</a> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, once again earned Magnet recognition, making this their seventh designation and reaffirming nearly 30 years of excellence in nursing. The <a href="https://www.nursingworld.org/organizational-programs/magnet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Nurses Credentialing Center's Magnet Recognition Program</a> distinguishes healthcare organizations that meet rigorous standards for nursing excellence. This credential is the highest national honor for professional nursing practice.</p>



<p>"This recognition belongs to every nurse and care team member who lives our values each day," says Sherry Wolf, chief nursing officer, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> in Rochester. "Their compassion, collaboration and dedication make Mayo Clinic a place of hope and healing and reaffirm our place as a Category of One in delivering exceptional patient care."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The designation process first began in 1994, and Mayo Clinic in Rochester has maintained Magnet status since 1997, placing it among the top 1% of healthcare organizations worldwide to hold this honor for nearly thirty years. This distinction reflects the enduring commitment, skill and compassion of its nursing teams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Magnet-designated organizations are distinguished by their collaborative culture, where nurses are essential partners in delivering the highest quality of care and driving continuous innovation in professional practice. These organizations also foster a positive environment for staff and contribute to shaping the future of the nursing profession.</p>



<p>The redesignation process occurs every four years and requires a comprehensive application and an on-site visit to demonstrate nursing excellence.&nbsp;</p>
