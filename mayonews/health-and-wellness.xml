<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;It seems like no matter what I do, I can't lose weight. Most of my family members struggle with their weight too. Do our genetics play a part in this?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;It's important to understand that we are all unique and gain weight for many different reasons. When trying to understand weight gain and why some of us have difficulty losing weight, there are factors such as gut and brain connections, how we control our sensation of hunger and fullness and how long we stay full. Over a decade of studies at Mayo Clinic have helped identify characteristics that can be associated with groups of people called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-researchers-explore-personalized-approach-to-anti-obesity-medications/">obesity phenotypes</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each phenotype has a single genetic predisposition (an&nbsp;increased likelihood of developing <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-health-consequences-of-obesity/">obesity</a> based on a person's genetic makeup) and interacts differently with their environment. In many environments we see today, there is an excess of food, and we're less active than before. Some people may feel hungry between meals, while others only have one big meal a day — our genetics drives this. Your genetic makeup determines which phenotype you're going to have. These phenotypes can help guide treatment for weight loss. Each of these genetic phenotypes, or genotypes, identifies the type of obesity and which medication would work best.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first phenotype is what we call "hungry brain." These patients start eating and don't feel full even after consuming large meals with second and third helpings. Usually, this runs in families. The other phenotype is what we call "hungry gut." These patients start eating and feel full after their usual portion, but the gut does not send those signals to the brain. Because of that, they feel hungry between meals. Signals from the gut to the brain are hormones, such as&amp;nbsp;glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1).&amp;nbsp;Semaglutide medications such as&amp;nbsp;Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus&amp;nbsp;work on behalf of the GLP-1 hormone. They connect between the gut and the brain, and they signal to the brain that you're full.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients who have emotional hunger are another group. Whether having a good or bad day, these patients look to cope with life by eating food. The fourth group is patients with a "slow burn" or abnormal metabolism where the body does not burn all the calories they consume.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking at these four phenotypes can help individualize obesity therapy. How genes correlate with an obesity phenotype can help determine which medications should be prescribed. Each of us also should have a unique diet approach based on our genotype and phenotype.&amp;nbsp;Many diets&amp;nbsp;have mainly focused on obesity-related complications, such as managing Type 2 diabetes or preventing heart risk, but none have been customized to phenotypes.&amp;nbsp;The concept of the phenotype-tailored diet came from multiple studies that showed metabolic benefits during and after the diet plan began. These findings were then matched to each phenotype to define recommended diets.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, we work closely with our colleagues in bariatric surgery through endoscopic procedures to find out, based on our genetics, how we can identify who will be the most responsive to each course of action. We want to bring precision medicine as we have for any other disease, and I think it's time we do the same for obesity.&amp;nbsp;<em>—</em>&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20166892"><strong><em>Andres Acosta, M.D., Ph.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>,&amp;nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>Bariatrician, Gastroenterologist, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-recognized-as-worlds-best-hospital-by-newsweek-for-the-seventh-straight-year/">Mayo Clinic recognized as 'World's Best Hospital' by Newsweek for the seventh straight year</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic has again received the No. 1 ranking in Newsweek's list of the&amp;nbsp;"World's Best Hospitals."&amp;nbsp;This is the seventh straight year Mayo Clinic has received the top ranking.</p>



<p>"This continued recognition is a tribute to our dedicated staff who consistently deliver unparalleled, compassionate care to our patients," says&amp;nbsp;Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., president and CEO of Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-and-heart-health/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Sleep and heart health</a></h2>



<p>Does how much you sleep affect your heart?&amp;nbsp;According to&amp;nbsp;health officials,&amp;nbsp;adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night are more likely to experience health problems.</p>



<p>Dr. Juan Cardenas Rosales, an internal medicine physician at Mayo Clinic, stresses that adequate sleep is crucial for your overall well-being, including your heart health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-know-the-warning-signs-of-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Know the warning signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a></h2>



<p>It's often silent but can be a deadly killer.&amp;nbsp;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy&amp;nbsp;is a genetic condition that occurs in 1 in 500 people.</p>



<p>Dr. Said Alsidawi, a Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;cardiologist, says the problem is that many people don't even know they have it because they have no symptoms. And in many cases, the first presentation is sudden cardiac death.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-researchers-find-caregiving-worsen-menopause-symptoms/">Researchers find caregiving worsens menopause symptoms</a></h2>



<p>In a first-of-its-kind&nbsp;study, Mayo Clinic&nbsp;researchers found that women 45–60 years old who are managing family caregiving and menopause face nearly double the risk of moderate to severe&nbsp;menopause symptoms. Women in the sandwich generation are especially affected. The sandwich generation is a term used for people who often juggle caring for both children and aging adults, balancing responsibilities like feeding, cleaning and medical care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-drug-may-reduce-need-for-aortic-valve-surgeries-by-slowing-disease-progression/">New drug may reduce need for aortic valve surgeries by slowing disease progression</a></h2>



<p>Researchers at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic&nbsp;are exploring the use of a new drug called ataciguat to manage aortic valve stenosis. Results from preclinical and clinical studies,&nbsp;published in Circulation, show that ataciguat has the potential to significantly slow disease progression. The final step to establish the drug's long-term effectiveness and safety is a phase 3 trial, and efforts to launch that pivotal trial are soon to be underway with an industry partner.</p>

<p>You may be familiar with&amp;nbsp;high-density lipoproteins (HDL), or good cholesterol; low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or bad cholesterol; and their connections to heart health. But what about&amp;nbsp;triglycerides? Often that word gets skimmed over when talking about cholesterol levels.</p>



<p>Dr. Regis Fernandes, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says triglycerides provide the body with energy from food. High levels can indicate signs of other conditions, like diabetes or prediabetes, that can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>

<p>You may have heard that people who feel faint should sit with their heads between their knees, but is that true? And how can you tell whether you or someone else who has fainted should go to the emergency department or perhaps even see a cardiologist? ⁠<br>⁠<br>Dr. Elijah Behr, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London, explains five things it is important to know about fainting.</p>

<p>A stroke can happen at any time and to anyone. You might be talking to your loved one and notice they're suddenly slurring their words. Or, while grocery shopping, you realize you can't move your hand to pick up a jar from the shelf. You can go from feeling as usual to feeling sick within a matter of seconds to minutes. Here are five key things to know about stroke.</p>

<p>In a study published in Science Advances, Mayo Clinic researchers found a new immunotherapy target called a cryptic antigen that may be key in helping the immune system fight tumors in ovarian cancer.⁠<br>⁠<br>Cryptic antigens are part of a protein — known as epitopes — that are usually hidden or inaccessible to the immune system and may be present in tumor cells.⁠<br>⁠<br>Researchers will explore cryptic antigens in designing new treatments, such as vaccines or immunotherapies, that could help the immune system target tumors more effectively. ⁠</p>

<p>In a first-of-its-kind&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(24)00353-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a>, Mayo Clinic&nbsp;researchers found that women 45–60 years old who are managing family caregiving and menopause face nearly double the risk of moderate to severe&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/managing-menopause-symptoms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menopause symptoms</a>. Women in the sandwich generation are especially affected. The sandwich generation is a term used for people who often juggle caring for both children and aging adults, balancing responsibilities like feeding, cleaning and medical care.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/kapoor-ekta-m-b-b-s/bio-20090811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Ekta Kapoor,</a>&nbsp;a co-investigator of the study, says women providing 15 or more hours of care per week are especially affected, with half of them experiencing moderate or worse symptoms. She says more menopause conversations are crucial to help women understand and navigate this life transition.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:32) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/02/SCRIPT-VIDEO-How-caregiving-affects-menopause.-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong><br><br>Most caregivers are women, and a majority of them are in their late 40s and early 50s — the same time frame during which menopause happens for most women.</p>



<p>How do they intersect? That's what Dr. Kapoor and her colleagues wanted to find out.</p>



<p>"It can take a toll on their physical health. It can take a toll on their mental health. And the same can be said about menopause symptoms also, which can significantly impact the quality of life in some women," she says.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a middle-aged woman looking sad, worried, depressed" class="wp-image-79121" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2015/12/middle-aged-woman-sad-thinking-worried-depressed-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms</h2>



<p>Menopause symptoms are divided into three domains.</p>



<p>"You have somatic symptoms, like hot flashes, night sweats, joint pains, fatigue and heart palpitations, etc. Then, the psychological domain has mood problems, anxiety. And the urogenital has vaginal dryness and urinary symptoms," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>



<p>Two findings from the study particularly stood out.</p>



<p>"Menopause symptoms across all domains, and not just the psychological domain, were affected, which was a surprise, No. 1. No. 2, when we tried to adjust for stress and the overall mental health of the women, this association between caregiving and menopause symptom burden persisted," says Dr. Kapoor.</p>



<p>The research, she says, emphasizes the need for better support for caregivers going through menopause and for better education of caregivers and their healthcare professionals regarding treatment options for menopause symptoms.</p>

<p><em>February is Heart Month in many countries</em></p>



<p>LONDON — You may have heard that people who feel faint should sit with their heads between their knees, but is that true? And how can you tell whether you or someone else who has fainted should go to the emergency department or perhaps even see a cardiologist? <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/doctors/elijah-r-behr-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elijah Behr, M.D.</a>, a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiologist</a>&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Healthcare</a>&amp;nbsp;in London, explains five things it is important to know about fainting.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-fainting/basics/art-20056606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fainting</a> or blacking out, also known as syncope, is a temporary loss of consciousness due to insufficient blood flow to the brain. &nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">There are different types of syncope</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vasovagal-syncope/symptoms-causes/syc-20350527" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vasovagal syncope</a> is the medical term for the most benign kind of fainting, simple fainting without a serious underlying cause, Dr. Behr explains. This type of fainting is common.</p>



<p>"In some people, if they have a drop in blood pressure from emotional distress, pain, illness or dehydration, for example, or just generally have a low blood pressure, any provocation causes a reflex in the heart," Dr. Behr says. "Rather than the heart speeding up and pumping more forcefully to maintain the blood pressure, it starts to slow down. The blood pressure drops, the heart rate slows further, and the heart can pause for many seconds; sometimes close to a minute for some people who have more severe fainting episodes."</p>



<p>Usually with this type of fainting, the person falls to the floor, blood pressure returns to the brain and the person starts to recover. However, if someone faints in a vulnerable location or vulnerable position, it can be dangerous to that person and others, Dr. Behr notes.</p>



<p>The syncope that most concerns healthcare professionals is cardiac syncope, blacking out due to an underlying heart disease such as a heart rhythm abnormality, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas/arrhythmia-clinic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrhythmia</a>, he explains.</p>



<p>"This is usually a more abrupt loss and return of consciousness than in simple fainting. If you're older, you're more likely to have underlying <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthcare.co.uk/patient-care/cardiology/cardiology-specialty-areas" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a> that you may or may not be aware of. That's one of the reasons to be more concerned about loss of consciousness in older individuals," Dr. Behr says. "Young people can also have heart diseases that can cause cardiac syncope that may be a warning sign of something more serious to come, so it is important to investigate it."</p>



<p>Others for whom a blackout can be a warning sign of a serious heart problem include people with a family history of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inherited heart problems</a>, unexplained deaths or premature sudden deaths; people whose fainting is related to exercise; and people whose fainting is associated with heart palpitations or the heart feeling like it's racing away, he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Before a simple faint, you might experience one or more signs that you should sit or lie down</h2>



<p>"There will be a sensation of lightheadedness. There may be a sensation of nausea or buzzing or ringing in the ears," Dr. Behr says. "Some people describe tunnel vision — their vision closing in on them before they actually pass out — and some may actually lose vision but still be aware, not lose consciousness completely, and then recover. Other typical signs include feeling sweaty and clammy."</p>



<p>Some people get about a half-hour of warnings before fainting; some people may get 30 seconds, he adds.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to do if you faint or someone else does:</h2>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Check that the person is breathing and has a pulse. If not, call for emergency help, and if you know how to provide <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-cpr/basics/art-20056600" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cardiopulmonary resuscitation</a>, initiate it.</li>



<li>If the person is still breathing and has a pulse, ensure they are lying flat, and their airway is open using the recovery position and call for help.</li>



<li>If you feel like a faint may be coming on, position your head lower than your heart: for example, between the knees.</li>



<li>Rest after coming out of the faint.</li>



<li>Drink water after the faint, adding electrolytes if you have them.</li>
</ul>



<p>"If your blood pressure is getting low and you're getting those symptoms, it means the blood doesn't get into your brain, and if your heart is trying to push the blood to your brain against gravity, then it's struggling. You really need to get your head level or below your heart so the blood pressure gets back to the brain, and that will avert all the symptoms and the vicious cycle that ensues," Dr. Behr advises. "Get your head between your knees or lie down and put your head down and your feet up in the air, depending on where you are and what is feasible to do."</p>



<p>Getting up and walking around straight away is probably the worst thing to do, he warns.</p>



<p>"Your blood pressure will drop further, and you’ll feel worse, and collapse and fall and injure yourself," Dr. Behr says. "The best thing is to stay where you are and get flat, and when you're feeling better, drink some water, maybe with some electrolytes if you're dehydrated. For general preventive measures, we advise most people who have fainted to drink more water and to sometimes add a bit of salt to their food, because generally they're running a low blood pressure."</p>



<p>Sometimes, getting hydrated and adding salt to the diet may not be enough. Occasionally people need to take medications to improve blood pressure control and increase blood pressure to prevent fainting episodes, Dr. Behr says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical help</h2>



<p>"If somebody has had simple fainting with the clear precipitants that I described, it is best to have a chat with your GP (your primary care physician) to talk about it. Particularly if it's a first onset of symptoms, it's best not to ignore it," Dr. Behr says. "Often people go to the emergency department after a first faint, which I think is very fair to do and I would encourage."</p>



<p>If someone has had simple faints before, the circumstances that bring them on are typical for them and they have been evaluated by their primary care physician or a cardiologist before, they may not need to go to the emergency department every time, he adds.</p>



<p>The more concerning situations are older people having faints where other conditions may also be having an effect, people who are having recurrent faints despite keeping well hydrated, if there has been an injury due to a faint, and if the blackout comes on abruptly and with other signs that there may be an underlying cardiac condition.</p>



<p>"We need to make sure that they are treated and that something else isn't being missed," Dr. Behr says. "Also, sometimes faints can look like seizures. They can cause fitting activity, and differentiating a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seizure and epilepsy</a> from fainting requires involvement of a cardiologist and neurologist."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">If you faint at the sight of blood, you may be able to condition yourself not to</h2>



<p>"It's very common, but it can be surmounted by various means," Dr. Behr says.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cognitive behavioural therapy</a> (CBT) may help, he suggests. In CBT, you work with a mental health counselor such as a psychotherapist or therapist to become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking, so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them more effectively.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-melanoma-stage-determines-treatment-plan/">Mayo Clinic Q and A: Melanoma stage determines treatment plan</a></h2>



<p>While melanoma is much less common than other types of skin cancer, it is the most serious because it is more likely to metastasize, or spread, to other parts of the body. The ABCDE guide helps you determine if a mole or a spot may indicate melanoma or another type of skin cancer.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-cholesterol-know-your-numbers/">Mayo Clinic Q and A: Cholesterol — know your numbers</a></h2>



<p>Cholesterol is a type of fat in our blood. Our bodies need a small amount of cholesterol to build the structure of cell membranes, make certain hormones and help with metabolism, such as producing vitamin D. The catch: We don't need too much cholesterol.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-help-for-a-sinus-infection/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Help for a sinus infection</a></h2>



<p>If you catch a cold or upper respiratory infection and it lingers long enough, it may turn into a sinus infection known as sinusitis. Symptoms can include a runny nose and nasal congestion accompanied by pain, swelling, and pressure around the eyes, nose, cheeks or forehead that gets worse when bending over.⁠⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/expert-explains-how-to-improve-heart-health-even-if-your-family-has-history-of-heart-conditions/">Expert explains how to improve heart health, even if your family has history of heart conditions</a></h2>



<p>Despite the prevalence of heart disease, many people are still unclear about how genetics can affect heart disease and, most importantly, what they can do to lower their risk. ⁠<br>⁠<br>Dr. Stephen Kopecky, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic, explains how you can improve your heart health, even if your family has a history of cardiovascular problems.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/asthma-burden-score-reflecting-patient-experience-may-improve-symptom-management/">Asthma burden score reflecting patient experience may improve symptom management</a></h2>



<p>Current asthma guidelines define asthma severity based on a patient's medication dose — without taking into consideration the healthcare burden, such as how successfully patients can control their asthma, how often they visit their doctor, visit the emergency room and receive other healthcare services.⁠<br>⁠<br>Mayo Clinic researchers propose a new, personalized approach to asthma using patient-centered information based on healthcare burden data instead of prescribed medication.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asthma</a> is a condition in which the airways in the lungs narrow and swell and may produce extra mucus, making breathing difficult and trigger coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath. For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack. Asthma affected an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and caused 455,000 deaths, <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/asthma" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the World Health Organization</a>.</p>



<p>There is no cure for asthma, but its symptoms can be controlled. For patients with asthma, remission is considered the primary treatment goal, with fewer or no symptoms, and the patient requiring minimal to no medication to manage their condition.</p>



<p>Current asthma guidelines, including those of the <a href="https://www.ersnet.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Respiratory Society</a> and the <a href="https://site.thoracic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Thoracic Society</a>, <a href="https://site.thoracic.org/"></a>define asthma severity based on a patient's medication dose — without taking into consideration the healthcare burden, such as how successfully patients can control their asthma, how often they visit their doctor, visit the emergency room and receive other healthcare services. In other words, what has been missing from the research behind current guidelines is data from the perspective of the patient's quality of life.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers propose a new, personalized approach to asthma using patient-centered information based on healthcare burden data instead of prescribed medication, according to a <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(24)00250-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine.</p>



<p>The Mayo-led study is the first to use two longitudinal asthma cohorts from the U.S. and 11 European countries to introduce a tool that measures both asthma control and severity and translates that data into a quantifiable exacerbation – a way to measure the risk of an asthma attack.</p>



<p>The investigators analyzed data from 1,037 adult participants from the <a href="http://www.severeasthma.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Severe Asthma Research Program III</a> in the U.S. and the <a href="https://europeanlung.org/en/projects-and-campaigns/past-projects/u-biopred/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">European Unbiased Biomarkers for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes</a> to calculate a composite asthma burden score based on asthma attacks and healthcare. They also added the number of instances each patient needed a rescue bronchodilator to reflect asthma symptom burden.</p>

<p>The lead author, <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/zein-joe-m-d-ph-d/bio-20563702" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Zein, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a pulmonary medicine and asthma researcher at Mayo Clinic in Arizona, says the findings show discrepancies between the current definition of asthma severity and the research team's burden score.</p>



<p>"The standard definition of severe asthma is based on prescribed asthma medications," says Dr. Zein. "Our personalized healthcare burden score includes patient-centered data that reflect disease severity and accurately predicts asthma remission."</p>



<p>Dr. Zein says the study looks at asthma remission using two well-characterized asthma cohorts. "Asthma remission has been proposed as a hypothesis. That is something we look at, but no one was analyzing the data to test it. This is the first study to test the concept of asthma remission," he says.</p>



<p>If further studies support the team's method of calculating asthma burden, it ultimately could help care teams better manage cases of high-risk individuals with asthma and improve their treatment.</p>

<p>A sinus infection is inflammation of the sinuses — the spaces inside your nose and head. When the sinuses are swollen, they can't drain, causing mucus to build up.</p>



<p>"A typical sinus infection is caused by the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common cold</a>, or most common viruses out there, typically lasting anywhere from three days to seven days. And it typically goes away on its own," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte</a>, a Mayo Clinic family physician.</p>



<p>He says there are some simple home treatments you can do to ease the symptoms, such as drinking plenty of fluids, taking over-the-counter pain relievers and decongestants, and using a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/expert-answers/neti-pot/faq-20058305?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saline nasal rinse</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/corticosteroid-nasal-route/description/drg-20070513?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nasal spray</a>. When it comes to sinus infections, in general, he says time is often the best medicine.</p>



<p>"But if somehow you start getting better and then start getting worse and feel more facial pressure — can be teeth pressure, fever, lot of facial pain, fatigue — after a period of a week, you should seek care and get evaluated by a clinician," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-alcohol-and-cancer-risk/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Alcohol and cancer risk</a></h2>



<p>The&amp;nbsp;Office of the Surgeon General&amp;nbsp;recently released a new&amp;nbsp;Advisory on Alcohol and Cancer Risk. It outlines a connection between drinking alcohol and increased risk of cancer, specifically cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus, breast, liver and colon.</p>



<p>According to&amp;nbsp;Dr. Donald Hensrud, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in preventive medicine and nutrition, the number of cancer cases caused by drinking alcohol may surprise you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-to-do-for-a-healthier-heart/">Mayo Clinic Minute: What to do for a healthier heart</a></h2>



<p>Heart disease&amp;nbsp;is the leading cause of death in the U.S., according to the&amp;nbsp;American Heart Association. Heart disease refers to a range of conditions, of which many can be prevented or treated by making healthy lifestyle choices.</p>



<p>Dr. Demilade Adedinsewo, a&amp;nbsp;Mayo Clinic&amp;nbsp;cardiologist, says that to keep the heart healthy, there are eight behaviors and numbers to keep in check.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-hospitals-named-among-americas-best-hospitals-by-healthgrades/">Mayo Clinic hospitals named among America’s Best Hospitals by Healthgrades</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic hospitals in Arizona, Florida, Rochester, Minnesota, and Mayo Clinic Health System in Mankato, Minnesota, were named among&amp;nbsp;America's 50 Best Hospitals&amp;nbsp;by&amp;nbsp;Healthgrades, an independent healthcare ratings company. In addition, Mayo Clinic Health System in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, was included in the Healthgrades&amp;nbsp;100 Best Hospitals&amp;nbsp;list.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-suffering-from-cold-feet/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Suffering from cold feet?</a></h2>



<p>Do your feet always feel&nbsp;cold, even when it's not chilly outside? While cold weather can be a common cause, persistent cold feet might point to something more — like&nbsp;circulatory issues, immune problems or&nbsp;nerve disorders.</p>



<p>Dr. Jesse Bracamonte, a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says it's important to seek medical advice if the condition persists. Getting evaluated can help identify and treat any underlying health conditions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-h5n1-bird-flu-infections-continue-to-rise-what-you-need-to-know/">H5N1 bird flu infections continue to rise: What you need to know</a></h2>



<p>H5N1 bird flu, also known as&nbsp;avian influenza, continues to spread, with&nbsp;reports&nbsp;of a third human case from an unknown exposure source. To date, 67 cases have been confirmed, and one death has been reported in the U.S.</p>



<p>There are no reports of the virus spreading from person to person, and the public health risk remains low.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"About 100,000 cases of cancer each year in the United States are due to alcohol consumption — and about 20,000 deaths. So this isn't a small problem," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>He says alcohol is the third-leading preventable cause of cancer in the U.S., behind <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tobacco use</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>.</p>



<p>"The risk starts with actually relatively low intakes of alcohol over a long period of time," says Dr. Hensrud. "Consuming it once in a while probably isn't going to increase the risk that much. But there are many people who consume it regularly, and there are many people who assume that there are health benefits on the heart. And these benefits probably aren't as strong as what we used to believe."</p>



<p>He says when drinking alcohol is combined with tobacco use, the risk of cancer increases significantly.</p>



<p>"Some studies have suggested the optimal amount of alcohol for people less than 50 is zero. So we need to dial back, I think, a little bit on our alcohol consumption. Be aware of it. An occasional drink of alcohol is not going to increase long-term risk, but we need to be aware of it and keep a lid on our consumption over time," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>
