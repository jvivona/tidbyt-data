<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I was diagnosed with COPD last year after struggling with multiple symptoms. I quit smoking over 10 years ago, but I'm dealing with the effects of it now. How can I best manage the symptoms and live as fully as possible with this condition?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER: </strong>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COPD</a>, is a leading cause of disability and death in the U.S., according to the American Lung Association. More than 12.5 million people in the U.S. have a diagnosis of COPD, but millions more may have the disease without knowing it.</p>



<p>COPD&amp;nbsp;is a chronic inflammatory lung disease most often caused by long-term smoking, especially cigarettes. Another cause of COPD is breathing in toxic fumes or gases. In rare cases, the cause is a genetic problem.</p>



<p>People with COPD are at increased risk of developing respiratory infections,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>, pulmonary hypertension and depression. Also, people with chronic lung disease like COPD may be at greater risk of severe illness and complications from&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-who-is-at-risk/art-20483301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>.</p>



<p>Factors that can increase the risk of COPD include exposure to tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke;&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma</a>; occupational exposure to dust and chemicals; exposure to fumes from burning fuel; infections; and genetics.</p>



<p>Symptoms of COPD often don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if cigarette smoke exposure continues.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of COPD can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Chest tightness</li>



<li>Chronic cough that may produce clear, white, yellow or green mucus</li>



<li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>



<li>Lack of energy</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss</li>



<li>Shortness of breath</li>



<li>Swelling in the ankles, feet or legs</li>



<li>Wheezing</li>
</ul>



<p>Most cases of COPD in the U.S. are directly related to long-term cigarette smoking. Stopping smoking can prevent COPD from worsening and reducing your ability to breathe.</p>



<p>Many people with COPD have mild forms of the disease and need little treatment other than quitting smoking. With advanced stages of the disease, effective treatment is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment for COPD</a>&amp;nbsp;can include medications, such as inhalers; oxygen; pulmonary rehabilitation; in-home noninvasive ventilation therapy; managing flare-ups, also called exacerbations; endobronchial valves; and surgery.</p>



<p>Living with COPD can be a challenge, especially as it becomes harder to catch your breath. You may have to give up some activities you previously enjoyed. Your family and friends also may have difficulty adjusting to some of the changes.</p>



<p>These strategies can help people with COPD feel better and slow the damage to their lungs:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Avoid smoke and air pollution.</strong><br>Besides quitting smoking, avoiding places where others smoke is essential. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs, so check daily air quality forecasts before going out.</li>



<li><strong>Clear your airways.</strong><br>With COPD, mucus tends to collect in air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking adequate amounts of water and using a humidifier may help.</li>



<li><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong><br>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-big-deal-about-the-mediterranean-diet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy diet</a>&nbsp;can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your healthcare professional may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during exertion.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong><br>Exercising when you have trouble breathing may seem challenging, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance. And it also strengthens your respiratory muscles. Talk to your healthcare team about pulmonary rehabilitation exercise programs.</li>



<li><strong>Learn breathing techniques.</strong><br>Talk to your primary healthcare professional or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also, be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation and relaxation techniques you can use when you're short of breath.</li>



<li><strong>See your healthcare team regularly.</strong><br>Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's essential to regularly monitor your lung function and tell your healthcare team if you have worsening symptoms or notice signs of infection. Be sure to get your annual flu shot and COVID-19 vaccine to help prevent infections that can worsen your COPD, and ask your healthcare team when you need the pneumococcal vaccine.</li>
</ul>



<p>It can help to share your fears and feelings with your family, friends and healthcare team. You also may want to consider joining a support group for people with COPD, and you may benefit from counseling or medication if you feel depressed or overwhelmed. ― <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/mais-abdou-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Mais Abdou, M.D</em></strong></a><strong><em>., Pulmonology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>La Crosse</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Wisconsin</em></strong></p>

<p>At 20 years old, Brescia Dover was ready to take on the world. </p>



<p>She was on her way to achieving her dream of being a professional photographer.</p>



<p>Everything was going according to plan when her dream came to a halt. Brescia was diagnosed with cancer. With her plans for her future pushed aside, Brescia's focus was now on her health and hope.</p>



<p>It's an unexpected chapter facing an increasing number of adolescents and young adults diagnosed with cancer.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Brescia's dream</strong></h2>



<p>At 4 years old, it was clear Brescia Dover had a flare for creativity. She readily admits she was never one to miss an opportunity to play dress-up, draw pictures, or tell a story.</p>

<p>"Being creative has always been at the core of what I do," she says. Early on she developed a love for photography and videography. Brescia's dream was to pursue a career that allowed her to put her creative energy to work.</p>



<p>After high school Brescia's passion led her to college to study film and media production. She even traveled to Italy to study abroad. After her Italian adventure, Brescia returned to the U.S. to finish college. First, she went to her doctor for her annual checkup.</p>



<p>"I lived a really healthy, balanced lifestyle," says Brescia. "My doctor found swelling on the side of my neck. I hadn't noticed the swelling and didn't have any symptoms." Brescia was sent for an ultrasound followed by a surgical biopsy.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The diagnosis - cancer</strong></h2>



<p>The surgical biopsy revealed Brescia had <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-what-is-lymphoma/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hodgkin lymphoma</a>, a rare type of <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-new-blood-cancer-treatment-options-with-chimeric-antigen-receptor-t-cell-therapy/">blood cancer</a>. "Being diagnosed with cancer at 20 years old was so scary and I wouldn't wish that on any 20-year-old," says Brescia. "I think about the young version of me who just found out she had cancer, and I just wish I could give her a hug."</p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-understanding-treating-lymphoma/">Hodgkin lymphoma</a> is a type of cancer that begins in the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-maintain-a-healthy-immune-system/">lymphatic system</a>, which is part of the immune system. Brescia says the news came as a shock because she felt healthy and had no family history of cancer. "It felt like there was something I could have done to prevent it, but I learned that there's nothing I could have done," says Brescia.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Being a young adult with cancer</strong></h2>

<p>"When I was going through college and diagnosed with cancer it was not what I was expecting," says Brescia. "Being a young adult with cancer was very hard and challenging. It is scary and can be very frightening."</p>



<p>At 20 years old, Brescia falls into a group of patients referred to as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">adolescents and young adults with cancer</a>. AYA patients are between the ages of 15 and 39. Experts says AYA patients face a distinct set of challenges.</p>



<p>"One of the reasons this age group is so important is based on their life stage; the things they uniquely face, like body image, disruption in school and work, financial challenges, feeling isolation," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/rosenthal-allison-c-d-o/bio-20178616" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Allison Rosenthal</a>, with the Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center.</p>

<p>Dr. Rosenthal knows firsthand the challenges AYA patients face. She was diagnosed with <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/car-t-cell-therapy-restores-hope-for-leukemia-patient/">leukemia</a> during medical school. "I had leukemia in medical school. There were a lot of missed opportunities in my care to recognize the issues that I might face as a 24-year-old woman," explains Dr. Rosenthal.</p>



<p>Putting her experience into action, Dr. Rosenthal championed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/adolescent-young-adult-cancer-program/sections/overview/ovc-20564751" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic's Adolescent and Young Adults with Cancer program</a>. The program is tailored to meet the unique needs of AYA patients to include medical care, fertility concerns, social and relationship issues, school and work concerns, and the personal and emotional impact of cancer in this age group.</p>

<p>Brescia underwent about four months of chemotherapy treatment under the care of Dr. Rosenthal. "She did a beautiful job of explaining to me what the process was going to look like and what my treatment plan was going to look like. Because I'm so young, she walked me through the whole process," says Brescia. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Cancer-free and focused on the future</strong></h2>

<p>After her cancer treatments, Brescia returned to college and got her degree. She the started her own marketing agency providing social media management, videography, photography, and brand development with her personal creative touch. She also celebrated her five-year anniversary of being cancer-free.</p>



<p>"I also have a podcast called the Checkered Jaguar where I get to have incredible conversations with people, share their stories and connect people who may be going through similar challenges that I went through," says Brescia. "We're all in this journey together and just being open and vulnerable with my journey, as challenging as it may be, I feel like it connects me to people all around the world."</p>

<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-mayo-clinic-expert-answers-questions-about-mpox/">Mpox</a>, a disease caused by the monkeypox virus, is a global health concern, with outbreaks in Western and Central African countries spreading into other regions. Recently, health officials in the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/monkeypox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview/mpox-outbreak-epidemiological-overview-7-november-2024">United Kingdom</a>&amp;nbsp;reported new cases of a mpox strain called clade Ib. The World Health Organization&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/26-08-2024-global-strategic-preparedness-and-response-plan-launched-by-who-to-contain-mpox-outbreak">declared</a>&amp;nbsp;mpox a public health emergency of international concern in August.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/binnicker-matthew-j-ph-d/bio-20513862?_ga=2.224776410.1916523742.1658847814-1971724449.1645459629?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Matthew Binnicker</a>, director of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/clinical-microbiology?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Virology Laboratory</a>&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic, says there are two strains of the virus that cause mpox, clade I and clade II. Each has different subclades that can cause varying degrees of severity. Clade I generally causes more severe illness than clade II.</p>



<p>"We've known about mpox, but up until recently, the outbreaks have mainly been geographically isolated within the continent of Africa," says Dr. Binnicker. "In 2022, we saw a large worldwide outbreak of clade II monkeypox virus that was associated with a less severe form of mpox disease. But we still saw cases worldwide, including here in the U.S."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Concern about clade I</h2>



<p>It is clade I and its subclades that cause more concern for the global health community.</p>



<p>"The other clade of monkeypox virus (i.e., clade I) is more associated with severe disease and is causing a very large outbreak in the continent of Africa, and we've seen some sporadic cases of that more severe strain outside of Africa," Dr. Binnicker explains.</p>



<p>He says this is a much more severe form of infection compared to the 2022 outbreak.</p>



<p>"Clade Ib is causing this more recent outbreak in Africa and sporadically through other countries. The mortality rate of clade I infection can range between 3% and 10% of those who come down with the disease. It is a much more severe form of the infection than clade II infection, which caused the worldwide outbreak of 2022," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Transmission</h2>



<p>"There is some evidence that monkeypox clade Ib virus might be spreading more easily in younger populations, and health officials are closely monitoring," he says.</p>



<p>"In Africa, they're seeing more cases in young children, which implies that more routine contact may allow for spread of the virus. Whereas in the 2022 outbreak, it seemed like more intimate, close contact was required for the virus to spread."</p>



<p>Both clades of the virus can transmit or spread from direct contact with an infected animal, close or intimate contact with an infected person, or contact with contaminated objects like clothing, towels or bedding.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of mpox</h2>



<p>Monkeypox virus is in the same family as the virus that causes smallpox. It can cause flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills and swollen lymph nodes. It's most noted for its itchy, painful rash. Symptoms tend to start within three weeks after exposure to the virus.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="665" height="374" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/05/ChildMonkeyPoxCDCimage16x9.jpg" alt="Young person in Africa with lesions from mpox, monkeypox" class="wp-image-340669" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/05/ChildMonkeyPoxCDCimage16x9.jpg 665w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/05/ChildMonkeyPoxCDCimage16x9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Image of a young person with lesions from mpox infection</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"In most cases of mpox, people will develop lesions, a blister-like rash, near the site of infection. In certain patients, especially those with a compromised immune system, the presentation of their lesions can be throughout the body. In some cases, people can have what we call a disseminated disease, where the virus can infect a number of different organ systems, leading to hospitalization and, in some cases, death," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Vaccination, prevention&amp;nbsp;</h2>



<p>Nearly 900,000 doses of the mpox vaccine have been&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.who.int/news/item/06-11-2024-vaccine-doses-allocated-to-9-african-countries-hardest-hit-by-mpox-surge">allocated</a>&amp;nbsp;for the region in Africa hit hardest by the mpox outbreak.</p>



<p>"They're really trying to get the mpox vaccine into Africa to increase the number of those vaccinated against it, to help drive down the number of infections there," he says. "There are also tests available for mpox, so we do have, to a limited degree, some tests within the U.S. and in other countries to diagnose cases."</p>



<p>Tips to protect yourself from mpox infection:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Avoid close contact with people who have a rash that looks like mpox.</li>



<li>Avoid handling clothes, sheets, blankets, or other materials that have been in contact with an animal or person with mpox.</li>



<li>Talk to your healthcare team about whether mpox vaccination would be recommended for you.</li>



<li>Isolate people who have mpox from healthy individuals.</li>



<li>Wash your hands well with soap and water after any contact with an infected person or animal.</li>



<li>Seek medical attention if you develop a flu-like illness and rash, especially after traveling to Africa or meeting a person who has been diagnosed with mpox.</li>

<p>How does someone deal with a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple sclerosis</a> (MS), a potentially disabling disease that attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord?</p>



<p>For <a href="https://www.maylingkopecky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May Ling Kopecky</a>, who was diagnosed with MS at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> as a teen, making art and music helps her share what it's like to live with a chronic disease.</p>



<p>"When I'm playing music, I feel like I'm able to just let myself express these things without really thinking too hard about it because it just comes out," says May Ling, now 30, playing a Beethoven piece at the piano, one of the roughly dozen instruments she plays.</p>



<p>Music and art infuse the Kopecky family home in Plymouth, Minnesota. String instruments line the living room across from the piano, and original artwork decorates the walls. May Ling's studio is down the hall.</p>



<p>"I've been drawing and painting since before I can remember," she says, pencil in hand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multiple sclerosis diagnosis</strong></h2>



<p>May Ling vividly recalls when MS entered the picture. "The first clear <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS symptom</a> that I had was when I was 13. I would bend my head forward, and I would get this electric buzzing sensation in my neck and spine," she says, describing a symptom known as Lhermitte's sign.</p>



<p>Like some MS symptoms do, that buzzing stopped in a few weeks. But at age 15, muscle spasms in her torso prompted May Ling's parents to bring her to Mayo Clinic, where a neurological exam and imaging tests led to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS diagnosis</a>.</p>



<p>"Multiple sclerosis is called a demyelinating disease," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/flanagan-eoin-p-m-b-b-ch/bio-20149754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Eoin Flanagan</a>, May Ling's neurologist. "The myelin is the insulation that goes across the nerves. What happens in multiple sclerosis is your immune system attacks that myelin and tears it away, and then the nerves don't work as well. That can be in the brain, within the spinal cord or within the optic nerves."</p>



<p>The attacks cause nerve inflammation and swelling that damage nerve fibers. The damage leads to scarring, or sclerosis, visible as white lesions on MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>That damage can cause symptoms such as vertigo, vision loss, and numbness or weakness, typically on one side of the body.</p>



<p>Sitting at the piano, trying to remember a musical score, May Ling describes brain fog, another MS symptom. Double vision, fatigue and heat intolerance also are among her challenges. Her thermal, insulated bottle with ice water is a constant companion.</p>



<p>Through her art, May Ling shares what others may not see. "Through painting my MRI scan, I'm also coming to terms with the fact that, OK, this isn't a fake symptom. This is real because I'm looking at the damage," says May Ling, who works in disabilities services in higher education.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New treatments for multiple sclerosis</strong></h2>



<p>About 2.8 million people in the world have MS, according to the <a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-the-society/who-we-are/research-we-fund/ms-prevalence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Multiple Sclerosis Society</a>.</p>



<p>May Ling has the relapsing-remitting form of MS, marked by symptom attacks and remission periods. This form often leads to secondary-progressive MS with symptoms worsening over time. Newer disease-modifying medications are suppressing MS attacks for many patients.</p>



<p>"With the new stronger medications that we have for MS, we're really seeing a great hope for our patients," Dr. Flanagan says, noting a decrease in patients relapsing and getting new lesions.</p>



<p>May Ling has had a similar story. "Her MRIs have been stable, and she's not had any new attacks or new relapses," Dr. Flanagan says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gait monitoring to detect early MS changes</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396372" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gait testing is helping clinicians look for early clues to patients' MS symptoms, with the goal of intervening before problems worsen.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the goal of early intervention to prevent problems, clinicians also are incorporating gait monitoring to look for clues to patients' worsening MS symptoms.</p>



<p>Lack of coordination and unsteady walk are common MS symptoms. In gait monitoring, patients wear sensors on their arms, legs and chest while walking. Data collected may provide information about hard-to-detect changes.</p>



<p>"With gait monitoring, we can see it and track it along, and then we can make treatment adjustments or maybe add in a different treatment to try to prevent that worsening," Dr. Flanagan says.</p>



<p>May Ling had her gait monitored at a recent appointment. "When I was being tested, I was like, 'Oh, I'm kind of walking on this foot weird sometimes, aren't I?'"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Managing multiple sclerosis at all ages</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="436" height="563" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-blurry-vision-IV-painting.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396276" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-blurry-vision-IV-painting.jpg 436w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-blurry-vision-IV-painting-232x300.jpg 232w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This piece by May Ling Kopecky shows the viewer what it's like to have double vision.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For May Ling, Mayo Clinic has been a trusted healthcare partner for more than a decade as she learned how to manage her chronic disease.</p>



<p>"All the doctors explained things in a way that, as a teenager, I could understand," she says. "Because I had a good experience, I decided to, even as now an adult patient, continue going there. All my neurologists have been really good about telling me exactly what MS is and what sort of treatments there are and explaining (my) MRI scans."</p>



<p>MS sometimes is called an invisible illness. To counter that, May Ling's realistic drawings and paintings invite discussion about living with a chronic illness by showing others, for example, what it's like to have double vision. She exhibits her work regionally and nationally.</p>



<p>"I'm communicating with the viewers about, you know, what my experience is," May Ling says. "I always find it super rewarding when somebody else comes up to me and says something like, 'I see myself in this work.'"</p>

<p>For the first time in the U.S., <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/monitoring-the-h5n1-avian-influenza-bird-flu-outbreak/">H5N1 avian influenza</a>, commonly known as the bird flu, has been detected in a pig. The virus is widespread among wild birds globally. It continues to cause outbreaks in American poultry and dairy cows, and it has infected humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">reports</a>&amp;nbsp;46 confirmed human cases of bird flu in the U.S., all linked to animal exposure with "no evidence of human-to-human transmission."</p>



<p>"The strain that was detected in pigs most closely matched or resembled the strain that's found in wild birds and not the strain that has been detected in dairy cattle," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/binnicker-matthew-j-ph-d/bio-20513862?_ga=2.224776410.1916523742.1658847814-1971724449.1645459629?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Matthew Binnicker,</a>&amp;nbsp;director of the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/laboratory-medicine-pathology/overview/specialty-groups/clinical-microbiology?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Virology Laboratory</a>&amp;nbsp;at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pigs and flu viruses </h2>



<p>Pigs are particularly concerning because their airways can be infected by both human and avian influenza viruses. Dual infections increase the risk of the viruses mixing and creating a new strain.</p>



<p>"It's important because influenza, both human strains and avian strains, have what's called a segmented genome, so the genome is broken up into different parts. If, by a rare occurrence, an animal or a human becomes infected with two different types of influenza virus and those viruses happen to infect the same cell, there's a chance that the segmented genomes can become reassorted, and it can lead to the production of a brand-new virus," he says.</p>



<p>While most novel viruses do not spread efficiently from person-to-person, there is a rare chance that a new virus could develop the ability to spread and cause serious illness.</p>



<p>"Pigs are thought of as an evolutionary playground for influenza viruses because multiple types – human and avian – can infect them, potentially leading to these reassortment events and production of new viruses," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Antigenic drift and antigenic shift</h2>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says influenza viruses change in several ways. One is antigenic drift, which consists of small changes over time due to mutations that occur when the virus replicates.</p>



<p>"Antigenic drift is the reason why we need to get an annual flu shot every year. It's because the virus that's circulating right now will, through the process of replicating its RNA genome, mutate and change over the next six to 12 months," he says.</p>



<p>Antigenic shift is different.</p>



<p>"It's when an animal, such as a pig, becomes infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time. In the rare event that this happens, the viruses unpack their genome in the same cell, and in the process of making a new virus, the segmented genomes reassemble in a new way that leads to the production of a brand-new virus that the population might have never seen before. The proteins on the outside of the virus look completely different — or different enough where a human's immunity doesn't recognize it," explains Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk for U.S. food source</h2>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says the risk to food and dairy in the U.S. is currently low. However, there is a risk of illness from consuming unpasteurized milk and milk products.</p>



<p>"Do not consume unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized milk products because we know that some dairy cattle are infected with the virus, and there is some risk if you're consuming or eating unpasteurized products," he says.</p>



<p>Cooking pork thoroughly kills the virus, making it safe to eat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to protect yourself from avian flu infection</h2>



<p>There are steps you can take to reduce your risk of infection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/older-woman-receiving-a-vaccination-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="older woman receiving a vaccination" class="wp-image-80533" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/older-woman-receiving-a-vaccination-16-x-9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/older-woman-receiving-a-vaccination-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"The best thing you can do is get the influenza vaccination," he says.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"It's beneficial for a number of reasons."</p>



<p>"One, it helps keep you from getting typical <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-mayo-clinic-expert-answers-common-questions-about-the-flu-covid-19/">human influenza</a>, which can be a very severe disease. Two, it helps prevent you from spreading influenza to other people. And then third, with circulation of avian influenza in birds and mammals, and now dairy cattle and even in pigs, it prevents the chance that we see a reassortment event," Dr. Binnicker says.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>He explains that vaccination reduces the chance of a human being infected by both avian and human flu strains, and it lowers the risk of spreading human flu to animals such as pigs, reducing the odds of a reassortment event that could lead to a novel virus.</p>



<p>Dr. Binnicker adds that anyone with a bird flock or a poultry or dairy facility should avoid contact with sick or dead animals to reduce the risk of infection, and if interaction is necessary, wear a mask, gloves and eye protection.</p>

<p>As a nurse practitioner at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, Angela Irizarry fully understands the health risks associated with excess weight, including the risk for diabetes and heart attack.</p>



<p>But those reasons weren't why she decided to make a change in her own life.</p>



<p>Angela had severe acid reflux and was tired of being in constant discomfort. She knew it was time to do something different.</p>



<p>Her positive experience working with patients in Mayo's weight management program led her to explore options for herself. She met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/elli-fernando-f-m-d/bio-20192046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Fernando Elli</a> a Mayo Clinic bariatric surgeon, who helped her confirm that weight-loss surgery was the right decision for her.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting the bariatric surgery journey</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395641" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></figure></div>


<p>Like all people who choose <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-bypass-surgery/in-depth/weight-loss-surgery/art-20045334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss surgery</a> at Mayo, Angela participated in a presurgical wellness program to build lifestyle skills she could use before and after surgery. She spent a lot of time working with the program coordinators, who helped her feel confident in her decision.</p>



<p>"The team walked me through each and every step," Angela says. "They know what you're experiencing, and they will help you through this journey in a really compassionate way." &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the surgery was completed, Angela lost weight, but she also experienced a bonus benefit — her acid reflux went away. Today, she no longer has acid reflux or takes medications for it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solid results</strong></h2>



<p>The amazing results Angela experienced from her <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/about/pac-20394258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a> journey at Mayo motivated her husband, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/irizarry-alvarado-joan-m-m-d/bio-20055198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Joan Irizarry Alvarado</a>, a Mayo Clinic internal medicine physician, to think about weight-loss surgery for himself.</p>



<p>According to Dr. Elli, it is common for couples to go through this experience and pursue surgery together.</p>



<p>"We have many couples who want to lose weight in order to improve their health and longevity," he says. "Having your life partner by your side throughout this process, supporting you every step of the way, often leads to great outcomes."</p>

<p>For Dr. Irizarry Alvarado, there were two other things that led him to consider bariatric surgery: seeing his pictures and wanting to be there for his family, especially his kids.</p>



<p>As self-described "Disney fanatics," their family loves to travel to the Magic Kingdom and go on Disney cruises. However, Dr. Irizarry Alvarado couldn't keep up with his family when walking throughout the theme park or on a cruise ship.</p>



<p>"My kids were at the set sail party on the cruise with the Disney characters, and I almost missed it while looking for an elevator because I couldn’t walk up the stairs to the party to meet them," he says.</p>



<p>After supporting his wife's lifestyle changes, he felt that he could make a similar change for himself, so he went through the program at Mayo, including surgery with Dr. Elli.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Life after bariatric surgery</strong></h2>

<p>About three years after surgery, Angela has lost 170 pounds, and Dr. Irizarry Alvarado has lost 125 pounds.</p>



<p>Their family still goes on Disney trips, but also travels regularly to other places these days — activities that seemed impossible a few years ago, like hiking a mountain in St. Lucia.</p>



<p>The couple says that partnering up for weight loss has been a positive for the entire family. Cooking nutritious meals at home has been a positive influence on their kids, and splitting meals when eating out is now a common occurrence.</p>



<p>"We enjoy so much more today, and it's amazing how many more things we can do now," Dr. Irizarry Alvarado says. "We are really living."</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><sub>Throughout her life, retired educator and social butterfly Lynn Maiman struggled to hear. After years of progressive hearing loss, bilateral cochlear implant surgery at Mayo Clinic in Florida restored her hearing and got her back to the busy social life and people she loves.</sub></em></p>



<p>A swim instructor, senior living consultant and retired educator, Lynn Maiman, 65, is a self-described people person. But for most of her busy and active social life, the Jacksonville, Florida, resident struggled to hear what was happening around her.</p>



<p>Like many people who experience hearing loss at a young age, it wasn't always obvious that she was missing something. Maiman explains that she didn’t piece together when her difficulty hearing began until much later in life.</p>



<p>"I remember when I was in high school, I asked my friends how they knew the words to different songs," Lynn says. "They told me they knew from listening to the radio. I didn't know there were lyrics because I could only hear the background music."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding ways to adapt</h2>



<p>Over time, Lynn found ways to cope with her hearing loss. She recalls sitting in the front row of massive lecture halls so that she wouldn't miss information during her college classes. Later, she began creatively filling in the parts of conversations she couldn't hear and, without realizing it, she began reading lips.</p>



<p>A gut check came when, after working for many years in a successful career centered around children, Lynn found she could no longer understand students when they spoke to her. When she was 50 years old, she had her hearing checked for the first time and was prescribed hearing aids.</p>



<p>"I lived with hearing aids for many years," Lynn says. "They really helped, until they just didn't anymore."</p>



<p>In 2019, Lynn learned she was a candidate for bilateral <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cochlear-implants/about/pac-20385021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cochlear implants</a>. Because she was afraid of the procedure and the possibility of losing what hearing she had left, she put it off. In the years that followed, Lynn began to experience balance and cognitive issues. She used a service dog to help her navigate daily living activities and struggled to maintain her social life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ready for the next step</h2>



<p>In 2023, Lynn decided it was time to revisit the possibility of cochlear implants.</p>



<p>"I made an appointment at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> to get a second opinion. That second opinion quickly became my first choice for treatment," Lynn says. "My care team made sure I understood all my options, and I felt very comfortable scheduling my surgery. I knew I was making the right decision."</p>



<p>Lynn’s surgeon, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/raymond-mallory-j-m-d/bio-20538468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mallory Raymond</a>, an otolaryngologist with specialized training in neurotology at Mayo Clinic in Florida, explains that cochlear implants improve both the clarity and volume of sound, which is different from hearing aids that only provide amplification.</p>



<p>"Our ability to connect with others through communication is at the core of what makes us human," says Dr. Raymond. "Hearing loss can lead to social isolation and cognitive issues. Fortunately, hearing is the one sense that we can restore if it's lost or diminished."</p>



<p>During a simple, outpatient procedure, cochlear implants are placed under the scalp behind the ear. Dr. Raymond says patients typically recover quickly, and the device is activated after a few weeks. An external processor attaches to the outside of the scalp with magnets, and the two components work together to transmit sound.</p>



<p>Once cochlear implants are activated, Dr. Raymond says the process of recovery and auditory rehabilitation begins. With the help of an audiologist, patients learn how to interpret the sounds transmitted by the implant, which are not as complex as what a person hears naturally.</p>



<p>When her first implant was turned on, Lynn says she cried because she didn't recognize what she was hearing as English. But with time and practice, she adapted to the new sounds, and now she can easily understand what she hears.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A life filled with sound</h2>



<p>"Lynn's progress with her implants is impressive, and her quality of life has greatly improved," says Dr. Raymond. "That's something I’m thrilled to have been a part of."</p>



<p>Less than one year after receiving her first cochlear implant, Lynn had her second implant placed and activated in late 2023.</p>



<p>A social butterfly once again, Lynn spends her time traveling, volunteering with service animals,&amp;nbsp;offering swim lessons to children and people with disabilities,&amp;nbsp;as well as playing and teaching mahjong. She is also passionate about her part-time work helping seniors find the services they need to age at home, something that wouldn't be possible without being able to hear or understand speech.</p>



<p>"I only wish I had gotten the implants sooner. The technology is amazing, and I'm able to do things that I couldn't do before," Lynn says. "I can hear birds now, and I haven't heard that for a long time. I went skiing and could hear the woosh of other skiers coming up behind me. It's been amazing."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> Growing up, I was told to drink orange juice when I had a cold because "vitamin C is the cure." Does vitamin C actually help us when we're sick? What are its benefits?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-c/art-20363932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitamin C</a> supports our immune systems, helps our bodies heal wounds, protects our joints and contributes to <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-do-collagen-and-biotin-supplements-work/#:~:text=Collagen%20is%20concentrated%20in%20bones,content%20is%20made%20from%20collagen." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collagen</a> formation, the main protein in the body. Vitamin C is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/antioxidants/sls-20076428?s=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antioxidant</a> that helps protect your cells against what are called <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(12)64861-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free radicals</a>, which are produced when your body is exposed to potentially cancerous things like cigarette smoke and the sun's rays. Despite all these benefits, there is limited evidence to support the notion that taking extra doses of vitamin C can effectively prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common colds</a>.</p>



<p>For most people, taking a daily <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ascorbic-acid-oral-route/description/drg-20068031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oral supplement</a> of vitamin C via tablets, drink powders or gummies may not be that beneficial because you may be getting it from your diet naturally. Our bodies don't produce vitamin C on their own, but a lot of what we eat contains it. Citrus fruits may come to mind first when we hear vitamin C, but foods such as potatoes, spinach, tomatoes, berries and other brightly colored fruits and vegetables are full of the nutrient. Contrary to popular belief, an orange bell pepper has three times the amount of vitamin C than an orange.</p>



<p>It's important to get your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20050989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daily intake of fruits and vegetables</a>, but many people in the U.S. do not. A little bit of added vitamin C may actually help those individuals. In most cases, though, if you are able to access and eat an adequate supply of fruits and vegetables in your diet, that will be sufficient.</p>



<p>Some people may think they should double up on vitamin C supplements when feeling ill, but more is not always a good thing. Taking too much vitamin C can cause side effects that may make you feel worse, such as <a href="https://mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea, vomiting</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach cramps</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/in-depth/gas-and-gas-pains/art-20044739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bloating</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20373223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heartburn</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headaches</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/a-flushing-disorder-a-case-from-the-endocrine-teaching-clinics/mac-20429375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin flushing</a> and even <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney stones</a> in some people. Make sure you do not consume more than the recommended daily dose of 500 milligrams.</p>



<p>High levels of vitamin C can interfere with multiple kinds of medications and results of certain medical tests such as blood or glucose screening. Using vitamin C while taking <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/combination-birth-control-pills/about/pac-20385282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oral contraceptives</a> could potentially increase your estrogen levels. For patients undergoing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>, the use of antioxidants such as vitamin C might lessen the effect of the chemotherapy drugs.</p>



<p>Overall, taking vitamin C in the form of food is the best way to reap its benefits, but taking extra vitamin C, particularly for those with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-immunodeficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20376905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune system</a>, would not be harmful. Some limited research shows that vitamin C may prevent the duration of a virus, such as the common cold. So, if your cold lasts a week, taking vitamin C may reduce it by 13 hours, which isn't all that significant based on a few limited studies. Consult with your healthcare team to decide what's best for you. <em>—</em><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Jesse Bracamonte, D.O</em></strong></a><strong><em>., Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</em></strong></p>
