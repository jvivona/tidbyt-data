<p>Eric Mason Sr. is many things — pastor, bishop, educator, nonprofit director, mentor, husband, father and grandfather — but one of the activities he enjoys most is singing.</p>



<p>Because of his work, Eric, 55, travels a lot — both near his home in Savannah, Georgia, and beyond — preaching to different congregations and, often, leading them in song. He's even recorded three CDs. So when he noticed he couldn’t hold a note and "it felt like my lungs deflated" when he sang, Eric says he knew the weight he'd been gaining had started to affect his health.</p>



<p>Still, it took a devastating loss and hitting rock bottom for him to seek help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A breakdown</strong></h2>



<p>Eric has a doctorate in theology and a 20-year history as a schoolteacher. He was serving as pastor of a nondenominational church and working on a prisoner reentry program for the Georgia governor's office when his mom became gravely ill.</p>



<p>Already battling diabetes and blindness in one eye, Eric's mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. As her only son, Eric wanted to be by her side — driving her to and from appointments and helping her through treatment. But one day, a doctor told them there was nothing else treatment could do for her.</p>



<p>"My mom meant the world to me," Eric says. "And I couldn't do anything but hold her, pray for her and try to comfort her. But it was killing me."</p>



<p>She died a short time later.</p>



<p>Caring for a sick loved one and putting his own health on hold had taken a toll on Eric. Just one month after his mom died, his doctor told him he had developed diabetes, and if he didn't lose weight and change his lifestyle, he could be gone within 10 years too.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Eric also received bad news at work, learning his position within the governor's office was being eliminated due to budget cuts.</p>



<p>"It was a tough period for me," he recalls. "Things got really heavy, and I just broke down. I didn't want to preach. I didn't want to do anything."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397358" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1.jpg 1224w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eric Mason before surgery</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Eric started going to counseling and trying to lose weight, but it wasn't working. "I was in such a low place," he says. "One day, when I was praying, I realized I needed to get help with my health and weight loss because I couldn't do it by myself."</p>



<p>That's when Eric reached out to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/bariatric-center-florida/sections/overview/ovc-20523458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Center at Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a foundation of</strong><strong> </strong><strong>health</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Located in Jacksonville, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, which houses the Bariatric Center, is just about an hour and 20 minutes from Savannah by car. Because he'd "heard so many good things about Mayo and had some family members who'd gone there and were happy with the service they received," Eric decided the trip was worth it.</p>



<p>Eric met <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/edwards-michael-a-m-d/bio-20456489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michael Edwards</a>, a bariatric surgeon, who, along with the bariatric surgery team, determined Eric was a good candidate for a weight-loss procedure. Dr. Edwards detailed Eric's options, including the lifestyle changes he'd need to make in combination with any surgery.</p>



<p>"Most of the time, the behaviors many people come to weight-loss surgery with are the ones they tend to continue," Dr. Edwards says. "So I tell patients that the behavior changes we recommend to support success well after surgery need to start well before their surgery takes place."</p>



<p>Eric chose to have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleeve-gastrectomy/about/pac-20385183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleeve gastrectomy</a> — a laparoscopic procedure that removes nearly 80% of the stomach — and got to work preparing for the surgery by following the lifestyle modifications the bariatric surgery team had outlined for him.</p>



<p>"I went hard because I was really serious about getting the weight off," Eric says, noting he went from roughly 350 pounds before he started the weight-loss program to 280 pounds on the day of his surgery six months later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From lifestyle changes to lifelong health</strong></h2>



<p>Now, two years post-surgery, Eric still follows the plan to a tee.</p>



<p>"It's a complete mindset change," he says. "I use a plate with sections, so everything is a small portion. I stop eating when my body tells me to stop, and I exercise regularly."</p>



<p>Eric adds that he also watches his calorie and sugar intake, and avoids several foods, including "all the white things," like grits, bread, rice and mashed potatoes. He also doesn’t drink soda. "For the most part, everything I eat is baked chicken, fish or turkey," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_after.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397360" style="width:281px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_after.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_after-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eric Mason after surgery</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What he says he's gotten in return for these changes is the rest of his life.</p>



<p>"I tell people this is the best thing that's ever happened to me," Eric says. "It changed my life completely. I used to have headaches and pain, and had so many things physically going on. Now, everything is about how can I help someone else or be a blessing to them. And it's about fulfilling my bucket list — going places like Las Vegas and Hawaii and walking this time instead of riding around on a scooter. It's like there's nothing I can't do at this point in my life if I put my mind and heart to it."</p>



<p>For their part, Eric says members of his congregation have been very supportive, noting that three have even opted to have weight-loss procedures themselves since his surgery.</p>



<p>His congregation also has been helpful in cutting out unhealthy foods, like fried chicken, which had been a staple at church gatherings.</p>



<p>"They call me the skinny pastor," Eric laughs. "I love putting on and modeling my skinny suits now."</p>



<p>"Eric's done phenomenal since his surgery," Dr. Edwards says. "You can tell he's much healthier and enjoying life, and is much more vibrant and more engaged with his congregation. It's remarkable."</p>



<p>Eric also has a new job in addition to his ministry work — serving as the director of family and community services at Greenbriar Children's Center, a Savannah-based nonprofit organization that serves children and families. But one of the major benefits Eric notices is how his weight loss and lifestyle changes have affected his singing. "My voice is lighter and more controlled now," he says. "And it's easier for me to hold a note. But the biggest thing is that I feel good doing it again."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/pokemon-party-at-mayo-clinic-childrens-center-brings-joy-lasting-memories/">Pokémon party at Mayo Clinic Children's Center brings joy, lasting memories</a></h2>



<p>In his 5 years, Arthur has lived much of his life in the hospital because of terminal cancer. That's where he met Kevin Pike, a security ambassador at Mayo Clinic, who ignited a passion for Pokémon in Arthur. So much so that Arthur, with Kevin's help and that of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, went on to throw a party for friends at the Mayo Clinic Children's Center.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/an-army-of-support/">An army of support</a></h2>



<p>A heartwarming mission in Rochester, Minnesota, as around 20 active-duty soldiers visited 5-year-old Gabe Downey at Mayo Clinic Children's Center. Gabe, who is battling rhabdomyosarcoma, has been receiving incredible support from soldiers worldwide after his mom shared his journey on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/10-patients-receive-the-ultimate-gift-in-a-single-day-at-mayo-clinic/">10 patients receive the ultimate gift in a single day at Mayo Clinic</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic surgeons recently performed 10 organ transplants within 24 hours, setting a record for both the hospital and the state of Arizona. On Nov. 19, Mayo Clinic teams worked around the clock to complete seven kidney transplants and three liver transplants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-covid-19-at-home-tests-and-expiration-dates/">Mayo Clinic Minute: COVID-19 at-home tests and expiration dates</a></h2>



<p>Taking a home antigen test for COVID-19 is a simple first step if you feel unwell or were exposed to the virus. But what about those COVID-19 tests you've stored away for the last year? Are they still good? Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, offers some guidance about COVID-19 testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/treating-advanced-prostate-cancer/">Treating advanced prostate cancer</a></h2>



<p>While most advanced prostate cancer is incurable, treatments can slow or shrink the cancer, reduce symptoms, and extend a person's life. Recent advancements in diagnostic techniques and new treatments have improved the survival rate for advanced prostate cancer.</p>

<p>Whether it's the annual <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/in-depth/flu-shots/art-20048000?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">flu shot</a>, latest <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/questions-answered-about-the-covid-19-bivalent-booster-vaccines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19 booster</a>, or milestone shots that cover pneumonia, shingles or tetanus, staying up to date on immunizations is just one way to protect your health.</p>



<p>"It's worthwhile having that conversation with your primary care team because we might change depending on conditions that you have and potentially even the age at which you would receive that vaccine," says Dr. Presutti.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adult vaccinations to update</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a> can be life-threatening when fluid fills the lungs' air sacs. In general, a vaccination is recommended for all adults 65 and older.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shingles</a>, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox, can cause a painful, blistering rash. Vaccination is recommended in adults over 50.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tetanus</a> is caused by a bacterial infection, often from a cut or wound. The Tdap vaccine is recommended every 10 years and also protects against diphtheria and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whooping-cough-pertussis-is-a-highly-contagious-respiratory-tract-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pertussis</a> – the latter known as whooping cough.</p>



<p>"If you're a new parent or a new grandparent, then you should be getting the pertussis update vaccine to decrease the risk of you actually communicating, or giving, pertussis to the newborn baby," says Dr. Presutti.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I've had stomach issues my whole life, and it seems like my trips to the bathroom are becoming more frequent lately. I've heard of IBD. What is it? What are its symptoms? What can help me if I am diagnosed?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>&amp;nbsp;(IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that usually impacts the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/gastrointestinal-tract/img-20007468">gastrointestinal tract</a>. IBD is an umbrella term for either&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326">ulcerative colitis</a>&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Crohn's disease</a>, which are two different conditions with similar origins and inflammatory processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract.&amp;nbsp;Ulcerative colitis involves inflammation along the superficial lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum while Crohn's disease&amp;nbsp;involves inflammation and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/multimedia/ulcers/img-20008060">ulcers</a>&amp;nbsp;that can involve&amp;nbsp;the deeper layers of the digestive tract. This can affect anywhere from the mouth to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/multimedia/the-anal-canal/img-20006922">anus</a>, but&amp;nbsp;most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine and/or the colon.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of inflammatory bowel disease" class="wp-image-221939" style="width:678px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure></div>


<p>Symptoms&amp;nbsp;are variable and may sometimes be nonspecific, but the most common symptoms that patients experience are&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">bloody stools</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>. Some patients might experience&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894">fatigue</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20352759">fever</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/joint-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050668">joint pain</a>. In some cases, patients develop extraintestinal (organs beyond the intestines) manifestations which can affect different organs in the body such as the eyes, skin, joints or liver.</p>



<p>Most people with IBD are diagnosed before their 30s, but some won't develop the disease until their 50s or older. To diagnose someone with IBD, a patient presents their symptoms to their primary care clinician or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, who takes a thorough history&amp;nbsp;to try to better understand how long the symptoms have been going on. This would lead the healthcare professional to order further testing, which can include an endoscopic evaluation such as a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">colonoscopy</a>.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922">Biopsies</a>&amp;nbsp;taken during a colonoscopy are needed to confirm a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, there is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease. However, there are many treatment options, including medical, surgical and dietary interventions that can help. The goal of treatment is remission, which means eliminating all the inflammation and getting back to what looks like a normal colon or intestine. The treatment options we use differ from patient to patient depending on the severity and location of the disease. The decision on treatment is shared between the healthcare team and the patient.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Leaving inflammation untreated&amp;nbsp;can lead to further complications. For example, if someone has persistent inflammation in their colon, that increases the risk for&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon cancer</a>. If someone has Crohn's disease, they're at increased risk of persistent inflammation causing something called strictures, which is narrowing in the colon or small intestine. Whenever there is a narrowing, it increases the risk of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20351460">bowel obstruction</a>, which would require surgery to help the bowels open up. This is why we are diligent in getting the right treatment to the patient and getting them to remission.</p>



<p>When it comes to IBD, diet is a question on everyone's mind. We do not have a specific diet for IBD, but we know that focusing on&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/dairy-health/chronic-inflammation-what-it-is-why-its-bad-and-how-you-can-reduce-it/">anti-inflammatory</a>&amp;nbsp;foods and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814#:~:text=Antioxidants%20are%20certain%20nutrients%2C%20such,radicals%20damage%20cells%20and%20DNA.">antioxidants</a>&amp;nbsp;and avoiding&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">processed foods</a>, which can cause inflammation, is beneficial. One diet that I always recommend to most of my patients is the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>. The Mediterranean diet is a well-balanced diet that has a lot of anti-inflammatory products and antioxidants in it, so it could be very beneficial for patients who have IBD. Talk to your healthcare team about what is right for you.&amp;nbsp;<em>—&amp;nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Victor Chedid, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterolog</em></strong><strong><em>y, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>"Stress can activate your body's 'fight-or-flight response,'" says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p></p>



<div class="wp-block-media-text has-media-on-the-right is-stacked-on-mobile"><div class="wp-block-media-text__content">
<p>When your brain senses a threat, it signals your body to release hormones like adrenaline and cortisol. These hormones can make your heart race, raise your blood pressure and boost energy.</p>
</div><figure class="wp-block-media-text__media"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="687" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Hormones-stress-use-this-687x1024.jpg" alt="Medical illustration: Hormones from the brain signal production of hormones in the adrenal gland.

<p>"Physically, this can lead to headaches. For people, this can lead to poor sleep. It can affect someone's ability to concentrate," she explains.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stress-management/about/pac-20384898" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Managing stress&amp;nbsp;</a>depends on each person's individual needs.</p>



<p>"Stress is often going to be our body's response to a certain trigger to a certain situation. So ways to respond are going to need to be personalized," Dr. Allen says.</p>



<p>Reducing or managing stress could include journaling,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meditation</a>, reading a book or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/exercise-and-stress/art-20044469" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical activity</a>.</p>



<p>Dr. Allen says yoga could be another strategy. She says it's important to make changes one step at a time.</p>



<p>"If we try to change everything all at once, we end up setting ourselves up for further stress or feeling overwhelmed," she says.</p>



<p><strong>Additional strategies include</strong>:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Eat a healthy diet, get regular exercise and plenty of sleep.</li>



<li>Take time for hobbies, such as reading or listening to music.&amp;nbsp;</li>



<li>Foster healthy friendships and talk with friends and family.</li>



<li>Volunteer in your community.</li>



<li>Organize and focus on what you need to get done at home and work, and remove tasks that aren't needed.</li>



<li>Seek professional counseling. A counselor can help you learn specific coping skills to manage stress.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;Finding the time to exercise with my busy work schedule seems impossible.&amp;nbsp;How much exercise do I need to benefit my heart, and what kind? If I like to play pickleball, is that a better form of exercise than say, weightlifting?&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Finding time within busy schedules can feel difficult, but if you dedicate at least 30 minutes of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&nbsp;on a daily basis, that can be enough. And any type of exercise is good for your body, even if you're just climbing the stairs for five minutes. Any type of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">physical activity</a>&nbsp;that you perform on a daily basis will benefit your body. Even doing everyday housekeeping such as gardening is a good way to get in some physical activity.</p>



<p>We recommend that you exercise for at&nbsp;least 150 minutes of moderate&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/basics/aerobic-exercise/hlv-20049447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aerobic exercise</a>&nbsp;per week, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/walking/art-20046261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">walking</a>&nbsp;at a brisk pace (that's around 30 minutes five times a week or 50 minutes three times a week) or 75 minutes per week of more intense activity such as running or jogging. If you run or jog, 75 minutes can be enough.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes, we dedicate that time to other things like checking social media or watching TV. It's a matter of finding the right time for you to exercise, such as catching up on Instagram or the news while on the treadmill. Trying to remain active is the key.</p>



<p>Remaining active as much as possible has been shown to be one of the best ways to control&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stress</a>. Another one of the biggest benefits of exercise is how it positively affects our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/sleep/art-20048379" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep</a>. After daily physical activity, you tire, and it's easier for you to fall asleep. Getting enough sleep is important in preventing chronic conditions in the future, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/symptoms-causes/syc-20373106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart attacks</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strokes</a>.&nbsp;For optimal heart health, sleeping at least seven to eight hours per night is usually recommended. This allows enough time for your body to recover and be ready for the next day. Fewer hours than this can lead to side effects that can negatively affect your heart and your overall health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the tips I always recommend to my patients is to try to get into a schedule in which you're going to sleep at the same time and waking up at the same time. Consistency is very important for sleep and building exercise habits. In addition to getting daily physical activity not too close to bedtime, we recommend that you turn off any type of electronic device at least an hour and a half to two hours before bed to set up an environment that is easier for your body to fall asleep.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes it starts little by little, just by taking baby steps. It's always better to take baby steps and remain constant than take huge leaps you're not able to handle later on. When you start little by little, maybe with 5-10 minutes of physical activity on a daily basis&nbsp;with a progressive increase in the time to achieve your physical activity goals, this is going to become a habit. Don't let it go. Keep trying. If you want to remain healthy for your kids and see them grow and thrive in life, the best time to start is now.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cardenas-rosales-juan-c-m-d/bio-20526630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Juan Cardenas Rosales, M.D.</em></a><em>, Internal Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</em></p>

<p>When other medical centers couldn't help, Thomas turned to Mayo Clinic for answers.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/deep-nicholas-l-m-d/bio-20529084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nicholas Deep</a>,&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/overview/ovc-20424084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">otolaryngologist</a>, had a plan.&nbsp;</p>

Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/SCRIPT-Hope-hearing-healing.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong><br></p>



<p>In an instant, Thomas feared he would never hear the laughter of his grandkids again.</p>



<p>"I started getting this weird, you know, weird kind of weird noises, and hearing just subsided. And then, they just went out," says Thomas.</p>



<p>Thomas lost hearing in his left ear nearly 40 years ago, likely from exposure to loud industrial noises. Now, suddenly, the hearing in his right ear was gone.</p>



<p>"All kinds of things are just flashing through your mind — you know, got grandkids, can't hear anything. How am I going to get around? How am I going to communicate? You know, it's just, it's just … it's pretty, uh, pretty emotional," he shares.</p>



<p>After seeing multiple doctors who couldn't help, Thomas turned to Mayo Clinic and Dr. Deep.</p>



<p>"This is a person who was getting by with one ear — very busy running a business — that all of a sudden was sidelined by complete, profound, bilateral hearing loss. We treat hearing loss, sudden hearing loss, as an ENT, as an emergency. And so, of course, we got him right in. We got him a hearing test, confirmed the hearing loss and started working to rehabilitate his right ear," Dr. Deep says.</p>



<p>But rehabilitating that ear would take time. And Dr. Deep had another idea.</p>



<p>"His left ear has been deaf for over 35 years, and so I brought up the conversation of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cochlear-implants/about/pac-20385021?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cochlear implant</a>," says Dr. Deep. "Those nerve synapses and connections between that ear and the brain, although they haven't been stimulated in many years, they can be revived, and so I felt confident that we could certainly get him back online."&nbsp;</p>



<p>The surgery itself was less than an hour.</p>



<p>"The cochlear implant has two components: an internal component that we place the time of surgery, and the external component, which is the microphone. That's sort of like a hearing aid, but it sticks on by a magnet," Dr. Deep says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image is-style-center-align-caption">

<p>Implanting the cochlear device was one step. Next was programming the device.</p>



<p>"An&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/audiology/sections/overview/ovc-20429056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">audiologist's</a>&nbsp;job is to make the implant work. So we are actually determining what sound is sent through the implant to get the patient hearing optimally," shares Dr. Courtney Kolberg, a Mayo Clinic audiologist who worked with Thomas to program the implant.</p>



<p>She says success for patients is about collaboration.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Dr-Deep-Thomas-Dr-Kolberg-sitting-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Dr. Nicholas Deep, patient Thomas Campbell, Dr. Courtney Kolberg, who collaborated to help Thomas with his hearing" class="wp-image-397590" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Dr-Deep-Thomas-Dr-Kolberg-sitting-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Dr-Deep-Thomas-Dr-Kolberg-sitting-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Dr-Deep-Thomas-Dr-Kolberg-sitting-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Dr-Deep-Thomas-Dr-Kolberg-sitting-16-x-9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Dr-Deep-Thomas-Dr-Kolberg-sitting-16-x-9-2048x1152.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Nicholas Deep, Thomas Campbell and Dr. Courtney Kolberg</figcaption></figure>



<p>"The patient journey is really a journey that we take together," Dr. Kolberg says.</p>



<p>And for Thomas, it's been quite the journey.</p>



<p>"I can't say enough about it — about the implant, the doctor — about Mayo Clinic. That's just been unbelievable. Hearing grandkids again … pretty incredible," says Thomas.</p>



<p>Thomas continues to work with Dr. Deep and team to help restore his full hearing. He will have surgery soon to have a second cochlear device implanted.</p>

<p>Richard Casper was one of the study participants. The Arizona man enrolled in the clinical trial at Mayo Clinic in Phoenix after his diagnosis of glioblastoma in 2019. Richard was given only months to live, but his family says thanks to his strength, perseverance, and innovative medical care, he survived nearly double the amount of time.</p>



<p>"To be almost two and a half, three years in after being told you only have a few months, it's quite remarkable," says Susan Casper, Richard's daughter.</p>



<p>Richard succumbed to the disease in 2023. During the treatment, his family says he had little to no side effects. In the months before his passing, Richard stated, "I feel great. If someone didn't tell me I have the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-learn-about-meningioma-and-glioblastoma-brain-tumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a>, I wouldn't even know it."</p>

"That is why doing a complete surgery is very difficult, as compared to say <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breast cancer</a>, where a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/lumpectomy/about/pac-20394650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lumpectomy</a> can be performed to remove not only the tumor, but a healthy rim of tissue around it," explains Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Surgery for glioblastoma presents a different set of obstacles. "When it comes to glioblastoma, it is challenging to do that level of surgery. You try to surgically remove whatever you can safely without leaving the patient worse off after surgery."</p>



<p>Another factor that makes glioblastoma so lethal is that it can be fast- growing and unresponsive to treatment. </p>



<p>"These cancer cells are quite challenging to overcome," says Dr. Vora. "There are some patients we see after their surgery, and by the time we are ready to start their treatment, they've already had a <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/connect-with-other-patients-who-have-fear-of-cancer-recurrence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recurrence</a> of the disease."</p>

<p>An estimated 14,500 people will be diagnosed with glioblastoma in the U.S this year. "In the best of circumstances the average survival rates are in the 14-15 month range. But for patients 65 and older, the group that was the focus of our study, patients do even worse. The prognosis for this population is between six and nine months," says Dr. Vora.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Attacking glioblastoma with a triad </strong></h2>



<p>For the clinical trial, Dr. Vora and his team mapped out a plan that would allow them to be more intentional and precise with treating the location of the glioblastoma.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="556" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397931" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1024x556.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-300x163.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-768x417.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-1536x834.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Enhanced-target-delineation-2048x1112.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"It is the triad of metabolic imaging, proton beam therapy and hypofractionation, which is a shorter course of radiation that might be the best combination to treat glioblastoma in the 65-and-older patient population."</p><cite>Dr. Sujay Vora, radiation oncologist &amp;amp; Principal study investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The imaging incorporated the use of <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. "<sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET is an amino acid tracer that can cross the blood brain barrier, and it can accumulate within the glioblastoma cells itself," says Dr. Vora. </p>



<p>Researchers combined these images to determine the location of the most metabolically active "hot spots" of the cancer in the brain.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Taking aim with proton beam therapy</strong></h2>



<p>Study investigators used one of the most advanced forms of radiation treatment, called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/proton-beam-therapy-program/home/orc-20185488" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proton beam therapy</a>. </p>



<p>"With standard <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/living-with-cancer-what-is-radiation-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">radiation</a>, the beams go through the brain tissue, so there's an entrance dose and the exit dose. But with proton beam therapy, we dial up how deeply we want the radiation to go," explains Dr. Vora. "It drops off its energy in the tumor, and then there's basically no radiation after that. It allows us to be more preferential into the delivery of radiation and protect more of the healthy surrounding tissue."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="897" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-1024x897.png" alt="" class="wp-image-397936" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-1024x897.png 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-300x263.png 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-768x673.png 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture-1536x1345.png 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Proton-beam-therapy-picture.png 1546w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>During proton beam therapy, a patient lies on a table while the machine rotates around the patient's head targeting the tumor with an invisible beam. The patient is awake for the procedure. It is painless with many patients reporting fewer to no side effects.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional radiation for glioblastoma, which is typically delivered over the course of three to six weeks, treatment with proton beam therapy for the study was conducted in one to two weeks.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="515" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-1024x515.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397937" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-1024x515.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-300x151.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-768x387.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-1536x773.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Patient-getting-PBT-2048x1031.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption"><strong>Patient undergoing proton beam therapy</strong></figcaption></figure>



<p>"I am hopeful that this is the first step of many where we can continue to move the needle and allow patients to live longer and live well," says Dr. Vora. "The goal is to improve the outcomes for our patients allowing them to spend more time with their families."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Nadya's story</strong></h2>



<p>2022 was a tough year for Nadya El-Afandi. She was on the verge of celebrating a long but successful battle with breast cancer.</p>



<p>"Out of the blue, I had a seizure. I went to the hospital, they did an <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-questions-about-mri/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MRI</a>.  After additional tests they told me the news: 'You have a glioblastoma,'" recalls Nadya. She asked her doctor if she should continue her breast cancer treatment. "He said, 'No'-meaning the glioblastoma would kill me before the breast cancer."</p>



<p>Nadya was not about to give up.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>Nadya is a wife and mother of four children. She lives just outside of Rochester, Minnesota. "My children said to me, 'Mom, you're a unicorn. Of course you'll live.' My mother has had a number of medical conditions and we never expected her to live this long. And she's still alive and with us," says Nadya. "My children have also said, 'You've got grandma's blood in you. You will live.'"</p>



<p>Nadya is receiving care at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Rochester</a>. That's where she learned about a new clinical trial called SAGA, or stereotactic ablative radiation treatment for glioblastoma. The phase 2 clinical trial is building upon Dr. Vora's research and studying a larger group of patients. The study is being led by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Dr. William</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882">Breen</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic in Rochester.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>Our goal is to transform the way we treat glioblastoma - in that we are using advanced imaging to help us better target the tumor. We're looking at shorter courses of radiation to minimize the burden on patients and their families and hopefully complete effective and safe treatment in a shorter amount of time.</p><cite>William Breen, M.D., Radiation Oncologist</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It has been 15 months since Nadya began treatment for glioblastoma. So far, there is no sign the glioblastoma has returned. "Nadya has already exceeded the time that's expected time to have a tumor recurrence, and she continues to do well," says Dr. Breen. "Nadya is beyond some measures of what the average, overall survival time would be."</p>



<p>While Nadya's progress in encouraging, Dr. Breen says it is important to note that it is too early to draw any conclusions about safety or efficacy of this approach to treatment until the study is completed.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nadya is focused on living her life to the fullest. Fifteen months after undergoing treatment, Nadya embarked on an adventure to Hawaii, where she spent time taking helicopter tours, snorkeling and hiking.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"We are living on the edge of medical miracles, and we are riding that tide. There's no cure for glioblastoma yet. But I've been able to take advantage of this medical opportunity, and it has given me a quality of life that is just outstanding. Every day is the best day and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it."</p><cite>Nadya El-Afandi, glioblastoma patient</cite></blockquote></figure>

<p>PHOENIX — <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> announces the results of an innovative treatment approach that may offer improvement in overall survival in older patients with newly diagnosed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/glioblastoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20569077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glioblastoma</a> while maintaining quality of life. Glioblastoma is the most lethal type of primary brain cancer due to its aggressive nature and its treatment-resistant characteristics. It is the most common form of primary brain cancer. Each year an estimated 14,500 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with the disease. Results of Mayo Clinic's phase 2, single-arm study are published in <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00585-0/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lancet Oncology</a>. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/vora-sujay-a-m-d/bio-20054182" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sujay Vora, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist at Mayo Clinic, led a team of researchers investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging techniques in patients over the age of 65 with newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) grade 4, malignant glioblastoma.</p>



<p>Results showed that 56% of participants were alive after 12 months and the median overall survival was 13.1 months." As compared to prior phase 3 studies in an older population having a median survival of only six to nine months, these results are promising," says Dr. Vora. "In some cases, patients with tumors that have favorable genetics lived even longer, with a median survival of 22 months. We are very excited about these results."</p>



<p>Glioblastoma is among the most challenging cancers to treat. The disease invades healthy brain tissue with hairlike tentacles, making surgical removal intricate. Surgeons must carefully balance removing as much of the tumor as possible while avoiding harm to critical areas of the brain responsible for essential functions such as movement and speech. Additionally, the tumor's cellular composition and its ability to evade therapies further challenge treatment efforts.</p>



<p>Standard radiation therapy is commonly used to treat glioblastoma and can be effective. However, a limitation is that it also exposes healthy brain tissue to radiation, potentially causing collateral, unintended damage. For the Mayo Clinic study, investigators used one of the most innovative and advanced forms of radiation treatment, called proton beam therapy. The cutting-edge, nonsurgical form of radiation therapy destroys cancer cells with targeted precision while minimizing side effects to surrounding healthy tissue.</p>



<p>Mayo investigators mapped the target area in the patient's brain by combining the advanced imaging technologies, including <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI. "Combining advanced imaging allowed us to determine the most metabolically active, or aggressive, regions of the glioblastoma," says Dr. Vora.</p>



<p>Treatment was completed in one to two weeks instead of the traditional three to six weeks. "The advanced imaging along with the proton beam therapy allowed us to be more focused with radiation and protect surrounding healthy brain tissue from the effects of radiation. We were able to see that patients tolerated the treatments well and lived longer than we expected."</p>



<p>According to Dr. Vora, the study at Mayo Clinic is the first clinical trial of its kind investigating the use of short-course hypofractionated proton beam therapy incorporating advanced imaging technology, including <sup>18</sup>F-DOPA PET and contrast-enhanced MRI targeting, for patients 65 and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.</p>



<p>The study included patients from Arizona and Minnesota. One of the study participants, Richard Casper, lived nearly two years longer than his prognosis. "I feel great. If someone didn't tell me I had the glioblastoma, I wouldn't even know it," reported Casper after undergoing treatment. He succumbed to the disease in 2023. "We miss our dad dearly," says his daughter, Susan Casper. "We will forever be grateful for the extra time we had with our father. The time gave us a chance to make memories that will last us a lifetime. It was also important to my father to participate in this study in hopes of helping others fight glioblastoma."</p>



<p>A larger, randomized clinical trial is now underway at Mayo Clinic. One of the study participants is Nadya El-Afandi, a wife and mother of four, who lives in St. Paul, Minnesota. She was diagnosed with glioblastoma in 2022. El-Afandi is now 15 months post-treatment with no sign of glioblastoma. "I feel wonderful," says El-Afandi. "I've had my fourth MRI, and we're not seeing any return of the glioblastoma."</p>



<p>El-Afandi is back to her regular activities and just returned from a trip to Hawaii, where she spent time snorkeling and hiking. "We are living on the edge of medical miracles, and we are riding that tide. There's no cure for glioblastoma yet, but I've been able to take advantage of this medical opportunity, and it has given me a quality of life that is just outstanding," adds El-Afandi.</p>



<p>While El-Afandi's results are encouraging, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/breen-william-g-m-d/bio-20543882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">William Breen, M.D.</a>, radiation oncologist and principal investigator of the current study says it is too early to draw any conclusions about the safety and efficacy of the treatment until the study is complete. "Our goal is to transform the way we treat glioblastoma using shorter courses of radiation to minimize the burden on patients and their families and help them complete safe and effective treatment in a shorter amount of time."</p>



<p>The clinical trial, known as SAGA, or stereotactic ablative radiation treatment for glioblastoma, includes patients from Arizona, Florida and Minnesota. "We are now adding another component that builds upon Dr. Vora's work to help us best visualize the tumor," says Dr. Breen.</p>



<p>Meanwhile El-Afandi is focusing on living her life to the fullest. "I'm so grateful," says El-Afandi. "Every day is the best day, and I'm going to enjoy every minute of it."</p>



<p>The study was funded by The Kemper and Ethel Marley Fund in Cancer Research and the Lawrence W. and Marilyn W. Matteson Fund in Cancer Research.
