<p>"I started having the seizures, noticeable seizures, and from there, it just started getting worse and worse," recalls Anthony.</p>



<p>It began after Anthony graduated from high school. He was making plans for his future and looking forward to attending college. That's when the seizures began.</p>



<p>Initially, the seizures were mild but quickly became more severe. "The experience (seizure) is like a loss of time, like a blank spot in your memory — like you're waking up without any recollection of what happened," says Anthony.</p>



<p>"The seizures were several times a week. His lips would be blue. His mouth would be blue," says Patricia Maita, Anthony's mother. "It so hard to see your child go through that and feel so helpless."</p>



<p>Doctors tried to manage Anthony's seizures with medication, but nothing worked. Eventually Anthony was diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy, or DRE.</p>



<p>In search of hope, Anthony's family turned to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona">Mayo </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinic</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona"> </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/arizona"> Arizona</a>.</p>

<p>"Up to a third of patients who develop epilepsy during their life will become resistant to medication," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parker-jonathon-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20537491">Jonathon J. Parker, M.D., </a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parker-jonathon-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20537491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ph.D</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/parker-jonathon-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20537491">.</a>, a neurosurgeon at Mayo Clinic who specializes in treating the most serious and complex cases of epilepsy, including DRE.</p>



<p>"These patients have tried at least two medications, and they're still having seizures. At that point, we know the chances of seizure freedom unfortunately become very low, and that's when we start looking at other options," says Dr. Parker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A battle for millions worldwide</strong></h2>



<p>Anthony is one of approximately 50 million people worldwide diagnosed with epilepsy. It is one of the most common <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/neurology/sections/specialty-groups/orc-20117078" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurological disorders</a> globally. It is characterized by recurrent unprovoked <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seizure/symptoms-causes/syc-20365711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seizures</a> caused by abnormal <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/eeg/about/pac-20393875#:~:text=EEG%20brain%20activity,-An%20EEG%20records&amp;text=This%20may%20help%20diagnose%20brain,that%20attach%20to%20the%20scalp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">electrical activity in the brain</a>.</p>

<p>Of those diagnosed with epilepsy, approximately 30%, or 15 million people, are considered medication-resistant. Uncontrolled seizures often rob many people of their ability to live and function independently.</p>



<p>While it is rare, seizures can lead to sudden unexplained death in epilepsy, or SUDEP. "We know that more frequent seizures mean the patient is at higher risk of SUDEP, so that's why we are very aggressive about treating epilepsy with all the tools we have available," says Dr. Parker.</p>



<p>Current treatment options for patients with DRE include surgical procedures such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain resection</a> to remove a portion of the brain tissue responsible for generating seizures. A less invasive procedure involves <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/epilepsy-surgery/about/pac-20393981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laser ablation</a> therapy that pinpoints and destroys abnormal brain tissue. While often effective, these surgical approaches carry the risk of possible side effects, such as memory impairment, motor deficits and speech difficulties. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/about/pac-20384562" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Neuromodulation</a> is another surgical approach that uses electrical or magnetic stimulation to interrupt abnormal neural activity without removing brain tissue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unlocking new hope for patients</strong></h2>



<p>Now, a growing number of scientists across the globe are part of an innovative trend in research, investigating novel ways to treat DRE. It involves the use of <ins><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/centers-programs/center-regenerative-biotherapeutics/about/overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regenerative medicine</a></ins> as a "reparative" approach to help the brain heal. </p>



<p>Dr. Parker is the lead investigator of the first-in-human clinical trial at Mayo Clinic which studies the use of implanted specialized inhibitory brain cells as a potential reparative treatment for DRE. Dr. Parker's clinical trial is underway in Arizona.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>"<strong>This is an exciting time for regenerative medicine and the potential it may have for millions of people who suffer from the debilitating side effects of drug-resistant epilepsy</strong>."</p><cite>Dr. Jonathon J. Parker, neurosurgeon and clinical trial lead investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Mayo Clinic in Arizona is one of 29 sites nationwide participating in the inhibitory brain cell implant clinical trial for patients with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/epilepsy/symptoms-causes/syc-20350093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focal epilepsy</a>, where seizures originate in a specific region of the brain. </p>



<p>Anthony became Mayo Clinic's first patient to undergo the investigational brain cell implant. </p>



<p>"We use a very minimally invasive technique where we inject the inhibitory cells through a pencil eraser-sized incision in the back of the head. Our hope is that, over time, these cells become part of the brain and help repair the neural circuitry, and reduce or prevent seizures without the side effects," says Dr. Parker. The cells are implanted in a one-time, single-dose procedure.</p>

<p></p>



<p>"Honestly, it was pretty easy," says Anthony. "I had no trouble with it." Anthony was discharged from the hospital the next day.</p>



<p>Doctors say it is still too early to determine whether the brain cell implant was effective, but they are hopeful. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Tabitha's life-long struggle to control seizures</strong></h2>



<p>Tabitha Wilson lives in fear, never knowing when or where the next seizure will strike.</p>



<p>The Florida resident was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 2. She was placed on medication that adequately managed her seizures — until the week before her high school graduation. </p>

<p>"I was 17 years old sitting in history class when the seizure happened," recalls Tabitha. "They had to load me up in an ambulance in front of the whole school."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"It was traumatizing. Something I will never forget."</strong></p><cite>Tabitha Wilson describing her seizure during class in high school</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Tabitha tried new types of medications, but the seizures only got worse.</p>



<p>"I fell down a flight of stairs, burned myself while cooking. I've completely blacked out and don't know where I am or who you are," says Tabitha. She was eventually diagnosed with drug-resistant epilepsy.</p>



<p>Tabitha underwent three brain surgeries to treat her DRE. Still, the seizures continued.</p>



<p>"I'll have good days and bad days. Some days, I'll have two, three, four seizures, back-to-back," says Tabitha.</p>

<p>Her uncontrolled seizures have robbed Tabitha of the ability to live independently. "I can't drive. I can't cook. I can't go swimming alone. I can't take a bath, only a shower and if someone is home with me," says Tabitha.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/deep-brain-stimulation/care-at-mayo-clinic/pcc-20384564" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deep brain stimulation</a> is one of the most recent FDA-approved methods of neuromodulation therapy for epilepsy. Studies show that patients who undergo deep brain stimulation experience median seizure reduction up to 70% after five years. However, Dr. Grewal says it is uncommon for patients to become seizure-free. </p>



<p>"Unfortunately, neuromodulation doesn't give us the seizure freedom we want, and that's why we are trying to combine deep brain stimulation with stem cell therapy to see if we can increase the efficacy of neuromodulation," he says. </p>

<p></p>



<p>The clinical trial involves the use of mesenchymal stem cells, a type of adult stem cell that has anti-inflammatory properties. MSCs may also support tissue repair and healing. Further scientific research is needed to confirm their therapeutic potential in the field of regenerative medicine.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"There are some patients whose seizures are just much harder to treat with the technology we have today. Our hope is that by adding stem cells and their regenerative potential, we can increase treatment success."</strong></p><cite>Dr. Sanjeet Grewal, Neurosurgeon and Clinical trial lead investigator</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The MSCs used in the clinical trial are derived from fat tissue and created at the <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Human Cell Therapy Laboratory</a> at Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida under the leadership of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/zubair-abba-c-m-d-ph-d/bio-20054536" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abba Zubair, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, a pioneer in cell therapy.</p>



<p>Dr. Zubair's research teams have developed a cost-effective method of producing MSCs for use in potential treatments for conditions such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/groundbreaking-studies-of-regenerative-medicine-treatment-for-intracerebral-hemorrhage/mac-20552299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a>. </p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/space-a-new-frontier-for-exploring-stem-cell-therapy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Zubair has also led innovative research, including sending stem cells to the International Space Station to investigate how microgravity impacts their growth. </a></p>

<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"My mission is to discover ways to address problems that patients have been struggling with and find a solution for them. </strong><br><strong>I believe the future is bright. "</strong></p><cite>Dr. Abba Zubair, Pioneer in Cell therapy, Mayo Clinic in Florida</cite></blockquote></figure>
</div></div>



<p>Dr. Zubair has several research projects scheduled to launch into space in 2025.</p>



<p>"MSCs are what we call multipotent, meaning they can differentiate into different cell types based on where they're placed. If they are placed near blood vessels, they can become blood vessel types. If they're placed by heart cells, they can become heart cell types," explains Dr. Grewal. </p>



<p>The hope is the MSCs eventually become neural or brain cell types and interact in the part of the brain where the seizures occur. "It's called paracrine signaling, where they're releasing signals to the brain tissue around them and interacting in a way to try to repair that tissue."</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p><strong>"I'm willing to try everything and anything to get some sort of control over these seizures because I've been living with this for so long."</strong></p><cite>Tabitha Wilson, Clinical Trial participant</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Since undergoing the procedure, there has been an improvement in Tabitha's seizure management. However, Dr. Grewal says it is too early to know whether this is due to the deep brain stimulation, stem cells or both. </p>



<p>Drs. Grewal and Parker say there is still a long road ahead to determine whether these cell therapies are proven safe and effective for patients with DRE. But they agree each day brings them one step closer to a potential treatment or cure for patients like Tabitha and Anthony.</p>



<p>"We've thought about this for generations, we just didn't have these technologies to enable it. Now we do," says Dr. Grewal. "So, whether it's wound healing, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/neurology-neurosurgery/news/deep-learning-fuels-neurodegenerative-disease-research/mac-20545173" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">neurodegeneration</a>, epilepsy or stroke, there are so many different studies going on investigating the potential of regenerative or reparative therapies."</p>

<p>On a Saturday evening in September of 2024, Mae Helgeson arrived at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, her small body reeling from the trauma of a life-threatening accident. Although she was intubated and sedated, it didn't take long for the care team to learn what made this little girl special. </p>



<p>"I distinctly remember meeting her parents — you just immediately felt warmth and love," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/schiltz-brenda-m-m-d-m-a/bio-20055455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Brenda Schiltz</a>, a physician in Rochester's pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). "I could so clearly understand who Mae was through them."</p>



<p>At age 11, Mae was both an old soul and a spirited child. "She was a petite thing with huge energy," says her mom, Julie Helgeson. "She was a deeply feeling person."</p>



<p>Mae thrived on being outside, photographing birds on her family's property, her favorite field guide in tow. Mae loved to draw. She was learning to play the ukulele. Her passions began to bloom once the family started homeschooling, allowing Mae to learn in her ideal environment — among the trees.</p>



<p>It was obvious to everyone who met the family that they were tight-knit. "You could tell they knew that girl in and out," says Claire Shea, a nurse who cared for Mae early in her stay.</p>



<p>From the beginning, the team focused on incorporating all the things that mattered to Mae. While this is the goal for every patient, the family's well-defined sense of their daughter enabled the PICU staff to honor her in unique ways.</p>



<p>"I often ask parents to tell me about their child. <em>Is there anything you think is important or that I should know about your family?</em>" says Paige Dighton, one of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/childrens-center/child-life-program/overview">Child Life specialists</a> who partnered with Mae's family.

<p>What her parents shared influenced everything from the small details — like the hand-colored paper birds the nurses hung in her room — to the most impactful moments — like how Mae would spend her final hours. </p>



<p>"They held Mae's hopes and dreams alongside the decisions they were making," says Dighton.</p>



<p>Those decisions were the hardest ones her parents have ever faced.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A musical pause</strong></h2>



<p>Several days after her arrival, caring for Mae meant providing a moment of reprieve through music.</p>



<p>When her dad, Matt, stopped Maureen Howell in the hallway of the PICU, he shared how much his daughter loved music and invited her to visit. As a music therapist on the Child Life team — usually with a guitar or guitalele strung across her back — Howell was eager to offer whatever support they wanted.    </p>



<p>The hours she spent in that hospital room would prove to be deeply memorable.</p>



<p>"Before my visit, they had gotten some difficult news from neurology," recalls Howell, "There was a weight — a heaviness — in the room."</p>



<p>Part of her role is to adapt her offerings, which range from therapeutic songwriting to guided imagery for pain relief, to meet the needs of the patient. That meant getting to know Mae and her family first.</p>



<p>"We're not just treating and healing physical needs," explains Jennifer Rodemeyer, manager of the Child Life program in Rochester. "We're also treating and healing the emotional needs of families," making care like Howell's so important.</p>



<p>Family photos and Mae's brothers' artwork decorated the hospital room, giving Howell an immediate sense of their connectedness. A few days earlier, Shea — one of the nurses who'd been there the first night — had decorated Mae's orthopedic boots with Sharpie to highlight her favorite things, from art to trees to tacos, while the nurses' vibrant paper birds had transformed the room into a nature scene.  </p>



<p>"We don't just think about the medical things going on in a patient's room," says Shea. "There's a lot of power in seeing them as a person, hearing the stories and bringing that in." Beyond creating a comfortable space for the family, this can help new members of the care team, like Howell, know how to connect.</p>



<p>As she talked with Mae's parents, they shared videos of their daughter playing the ukulele, welcoming Howell into their world. When she asked if she could sing for them, others in the room quietly departed.</p>



<p>It almost felt like time stood still as she strummed song after song, giving Mae's parents the opportunity to simply hold their girl and grieve.</p>



<p>"They were just lying in bed with her — singing along with me at times, crying, just kind of blocking out everything else that was happening," Howell says. "They just took that time to be together."</p>



<p>From "Over the Rainbow" to "Yellow" by Coldplay, Howell adapted her playlist — and in some cases, the song's lyrics — to offer as soothing an experience as possible for Mae's parents.</p>



<p>At a couple points, Julie noticed Matt glancing at her, silently asking if she needed a break. "I was like, 'No, stay,'" says Julie. She didn't want Howell's music — or their moment with Mae — to end. "Maureen created a remarkable, sacred space."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A devastating decision</strong></h2>



<p>It was only a couple of days later that Mae's family was faced with the devastating decision they'd hoped to avoid. As the severity of Mae's brain injury became apparent, they realized their daughter wouldn't be coming home. The question shifted from "Can we save her?" to "How do we say goodbye?"</p>



<p>Following their lead, the team began focusing on end-of-life care.</p>



<p>"Dr. Schiltz gave us the space to think and process our emotions — it didn't feel rushed," says Matt. "I think she would have sat there all day with us. There were some pretty long, quiet times with her next to us, which was what we needed."</p>



<p>From the beginning, Julie and Matt had been clear that a meaningful life for Mae would include photographing her beloved birds and enjoying nature.</p>



<p>"Life in that way for Mae was really not negotiable," Julie says. "They supported us following our instincts. To stay true to who we believe Mae is and what she would want."</p>



<p>"Sometimes, we just need to give the families 'permission' to know what's best," says Dighton.</p>



<p>The team also sat down with the extended family to explain Mae's condition, which wasn't always obvious, since she still looked like Mae — a beautiful sprite of a girl with sun-kissed hair.   </p>



<p>"We wanted to make sure that everybody walked away from this awful, tragic situation feeling as at peace as possible," says Dr. Schiltz.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="768" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/20240830_092100-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-401305" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/20240830_092100-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/20240830_092100-300x225.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/20240830_092100-768x576.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/20240830_092100-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2025/03/20240830_092100-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>With the guidance of the Child Life team, the parents took their boys — Henrik, 9, and Oscar, 7 — to a nearby park to prepare them, but also to seek their perspective, which they considered as valuable as their own. "I asked them, 'What would feel like a good life for Mae?'" says Julie.</p>



<p>Even as young kids, they knew what their parents did — that a life for Mae was a life spent outdoors. Freedom for Mae meant engaging intimately with the natural world.  </p>



<p>Before heading to the hospital, Henrik and Oscar chose a leaf to give to their sister, which they planned to add to the growing collection of bird feathers clutched tight in her hands.</p>



<p>Back in Mae's room, the boys peered quietly at the medical equipment, soaking it all in. They showed Dighton the leaf they'd found. Too nervous to place it in Mae's hand, they asked their dad to do it — their own quiet goodbye.   </p>



<p>"This family handled everything with such compassion and tenderness," says Dighton. "They were the epitome of creating something beautiful and impactful," while facing the outcome no family wants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A beautiful goodbye</strong></h2>



<p>With the support of the care team, Julie and Matt carried that beauty into Mae's final day.</p>



<p>"When they were ready to take her off life support, they wanted to do it outside," says Dr. Schiltz.</p>



<p>Several days before, the team had brought Mae into a courtyard near the PICU, giving her the fresh air she loved so much. Now, the family wanted to venture farther out to a quiet, grassy knoll on Mayo's grounds. "We found these big, majestic trees — not just one kind, but like four different species," says Matt. He and Julie appreciated the nod to Mae's love of natural diversity.</p>



<p>Dr. Schiltz, Katie Schiltz, a nurse, and Nanette Matzke, a respiratory therapist, were determined to give them this gift. Together, the trio created a plan to transport Mae, along with her ventilator and other medical items they would need to keep her comfortable.</p>



<p>"This is what we do for our kids and families," says Dr. Schiltz. "We will do everything humanly possible to give every child the best possible care. And that care doesn't end because we can't save them."</p>



<p>As the little group wheeled Mae outside, others in the unit came together to show their love and support. "We turned the corner, and every single nurse was lining the hallway," remembers Julie. "I just dropped to the floor. That moment was as challenging as it was beautiful."</p>



<p>After taking Mae to the family's chosen spot, Matt laid his little girl on a blanket spread across their laps under the trees. The team extubated her, and as the ventilator quieted, chickadees and nuthatches flittered nearby. A brave squirrel ventured close to the blanket.</p>



<p>"Nature showed up right when we needed it," says Matt. "We couldn't have hoped for anything else in that moment."</p>



<p>In the stillness of the day, "her parents just held her," recalls Dr. Schiltz. "They spent a couple of hours outside, with the birds and the sunshine coming through the trees. It was as beautiful a situation as you could ever want."</p>



<p>Later the next day, on Sept. 9, 2024, Mae passed away in her room at Saint Marys with her parents by her side.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Remembering Mae</strong></h2>



<p>During her time in Mae's room, Howell had watched Julie and Matt listen to their daughter's heartbeat with a nurse's stethoscope. She'd asked them if they wanted to record the sound.</p>



<p>Their "yes" enabled Howell to care for them in one final way.</p>



<p>When invited to sing at Mae's funeral, Howell suggested a more lasting way to honor her legacy — recording a song with Mae's heartbeat thrumming in the background. The family played the song at the service, an audible reminder illuminating their daughter's boundless, beautiful energy.</p>



<p>The care team has found their own ways of remembering Mae, who left a mark on all their hearts.</p>



<p>"It was so clear that Mae and her family touched so many people and that so many people were able to support them," says Howell. "This was one of the most beautiful examples of that in my time at Mayo."</p>



<p>Many of the staff still cry when they talk about her. When teaching trainees, Dr. Schiltz makes a point to bring up Mae, encouraging them to care for patients the way the PICU team cared for her.</p>



<p>"None of this was because any one individual did something. It was because we had an entire team focused on helping this family," she says. "It was about giving them everything we could in such a tragic situation."</p>



<p>For Julie and Matt, that care was apparent in the tender way the nurses cleaned Mae's hair. The shared sadness they saw in others' eyes. The willingness to do whatever it took to give them their goodbye. "We were all praying for a miracle at the end of this," says Matt. "It was the miracle we didn't get, but the care we received was remarkable. It was just as much about what we wanted for her as what we needed for us. There was care for all of us."</p>

<p><br>A comprehensive review published by Mayo Clinic researchers advances the understanding of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), the most common inherited form of kidney disease and the fourth leading cause of kidney failure worldwide.</p>



<p>Published in the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2831904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)</a>, the review advances the understanding of ADPKD, which accounts for 5-10% of kidney failure in the U.S. and Europe. Its prevalence in the U.S. is 9.3 cases per 10,000 people.</p>

<p>"This is a vital resource for healthcare providers to stay informed about the latest diagnostic tools and treatment strategies to enhance patient care," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/chebib-fouad-t-m-d/bio-20434759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fouad Chebib, M.D.</a>, a Mayo Clinic nephrologist and first author of the review. "It covers how the disease disrupts the normal functioning of the body, signs and symptoms of the disease, diagnosis, treatment and the likely outcome, equipping healthcare providers to manage this complex condition, improving the quality of life through timely, evidence-based care."</p>



<p>Physicians typically diagnose ADPKD in patients who are between the ages of 27 and 42. The disease causes fluid-filled cysts to grow on the kidneys, leading to kidney failure. Over 90% of people over age 35 diagnosed with ADPKD also present with multiple liver cysts, which can cause discomfort or pain.</p>



<p>ADPKD symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people may not have any symptoms, while others may experience high blood pressure, pain in the back or side, blood in the urine, frequent urinary tract infections and kidney stones. </p>



<p>Hypertension affects 70-80% of people with ADPKD, and 9-14% of them develop brain aneurysms (a weakened and bulging area in the wall of a blood vessel), which have a low rupture rate.</p>



<p>A change in one of two genes, PKD1 (78%) or PKD2 (15%), causes most cases of ADPKD. If a person has one of these changes, they have a 50% chance of passing the condition on to their children. However, 10-25% of people have a genetic alteration not inherited from either parent.</p>



<p>The review provides practical guidance on managing blood pressure, sodium intake, hydration and lifestyle changes to delay complications such as kidney failure, liver cysts and hypertension to slow disease progression.</p>



<p>A key tool in managing the disease is the Mayo Imaging Classification (MIC), which predicts the severity of the disease based on a person's kidney size and growth rate. Higher MIC classifications indicate faster growth and an earlier need for kidney replacement (dialysis or kidney transplantation). Roughly half of ADPKD patients need kidney replacement therapy by age 62.</p>



<p>The review also explores the use of novel therapies, such as the drug tolvaptan, recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration to slow kidney function decline for high-risk adults at risk of rapidly progressing ADPKD.</p>

<p>The review recommends that a kidney specialist who manages patients with ADPKD should share decision-making with the patient regarding genetic testing, treatments, monitoring and aneurysm screening. This collaborative approach recognizes the importance of the physician's medical expertise and the patient's values, preferences, and goals. It also says patients with ADPKD should be aware of the symptoms of ruptured aneurysms (sudden, severe headache) and the need for immediate medical attention should they experience those symptoms.</p>

So what's happening? What can you do?  <p></p>



<p>While hay fever alone may not be life threatening, it can be uncomfortable, says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bhasin-arveen-k-m-d/bio-20055626?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Arveen Bhasin</a>, a Mayo Clinic allergy and immunology expert. She offers these tips for relief from spring pollen and allergies and tells you when it's time to see an allergist.</p>

<p>"If you're prone towards allergies, you develop an antibody called IGE to that particular allergen. When you're exposed to that allergen, it causes the release of histamine and these other mediators," says Dr. Bhasin.</p>



<p>And that is when spring's unfurling can feel downright bad. The first step is to control your exposures, says Dr. Bhasin.</p>



<p>Some of those environmental control measures include keeping windows at home, in the car and at work closed.</p>



<p>"If it's a dry and windy day, the pollen is blowing. You want to run the air conditioning because, that way, you're recirculating the clean air," she says.</p>



<p>For regular allergy sufferers, start your medication a couple weeks before the season starts.</p>



<p>"First-line treatment is what we call oral antihistamines that help with some of the itching, running, sneezing. And the nasal spray is really helping to focus on some of the congestion and the runny nose," Dr. Bhasin says.</p>



<p>Saline solutions using distilled water are also helpful.</p>



<p> And if these tips don't help? Dr. Bhasin says that is the time to make an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/chronic-rhinosinusitis-specialty-group/overview/ovc-20485397?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appointment.</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/appointments"></a></p>



<p>"The best time to engage an allergist is really when you've tried all the environmental control measures that you can, and you've tried over-the-counter medications, but you're still symptomatic," says Dr. Bhasin.</p>

<p>Saline irrigation solutions can be purchased ready-made or as kits to add to water. You can also use a homemade solution. Look for a squeeze bottle or a neti pot — a small container with a spout designed for nose rinsing — at your pharmacy or health food store.</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>
</div></div>



<p>To make up the saline irrigation solution, do not use tap water, as it can contain organisms that could cause infection. Use water that's distilled or sterile. You can also use water that was boiled and cooled. Another option is using water that has been filtered using a filter with an absolute pore size of 1 micron or smaller.</p>



<p>To prevent infections, wash the bottle or pot with hot soapy water and rinse it after every use and leave it open to air-dry. Do not share a container with other people.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> One of the biggest things I have missed since my office went remote is going on walks with my coworkers throughout the day. With so many added responsibilities at work, I can hardly find time to leave my desk. How is all this sitting affecting me? How can I find a balance?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> We understand the reality is that people have less and less time to exercise. While <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercising</a> before or after work is extremely important, it is just as important to stay active throughout the day. You may be surprised to hear that sitting for eight or more hours a day is comparable to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/nicotine-dependence/symptoms-causes/syc-20351584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">smoking</a> a pack of cigarettes a day in terms of heart risk. Sitting for too long throughout the day is one of the major risk factors for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20370588" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cancer</a> and many medical conditions. The solution? An active office can empower you to break out of a sedentary lifestyle. </p>



<p>An active workstation is essentially a desk where you are not sitting. This can mean a standing desk or one where you move around, such as biking, walking or using a step machine. An active workstation has many benefits. The main benefit is that it allows the user to be productive while burning calories at the same time. Walking pads or treadmills allow you to walk at a slow speed and answer emails, work on a project or participate in a video conference call.</p>



<p>An active workstation does not mean that you need to be moving all the time. And you don't have to be active for too long to reap the benefits of activity. It has been shown that even when you are standing, you are more likely to be spontaneously mobile than when you are sitting. This is important to keep in mind. Overall, sitting for less than three or four hours throughout the day is a good goal for those who are able.</p>



<p>Another concept that is gaining popularity is the idea of "snack" activities. A "snack" is doing something for two or three minutes after sitting for an hour. This helps you break the sedentary status of your body by taking the stairs for a few flights, doing some pushups or something meaningful in terms of activity for just a few minutes, and then coming back and continuing your work. These little episodes of activity reset your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">m</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/metabolism/art-20046508">tabolic</a> clock. Activity snacks can cause significant biological changes in your cells, metabolism and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">chol</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">e</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">sterol</a>. You may notice your mind feeling sharper for the next half hour. </p>



<p>While "activity snacking" is an affordable way to implement movement into your daily routine, you don't need a lot of money or a big investment to switch up your office furniture. There are some adapters out there that you put on top of your desk to raise or lower your monitor or laptop computer, allowing you to stand. Some people get creative and use a stack of books or other existing items. The bottom line is that everyone should feel motivated to redesign their home offices in order to be active longer throughout the day. This leaves us with less room for excuses. And, if you have days where you're stuck going into the office, you still have options. Consider taking the stairs instead of the elevator. <em>— </em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lopez-jimenez-francisco-m-d-m-s/bio-20053705?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Francisco Lopez-Jimenez, M.D.,</strong></a><strong><em> Cardiovascular Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</em></strong></p>

<p>Your kidneys balance the amount of sodium in your body. If you're getting too much, it builds up in your blood. Your heart works harder to pump and increases blood pressure, raising the risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stroke</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/multimedia/vid-20522473?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney disease</a>.</p>



<p>"Chronic kidney disease — that's the way that we describe what occurs when the kidney has issues with filtering wastes and toxins from the blood," says Dr. Porter.</p>



<p>Sodium is added to most processed foods. It's also in a lot of condiments. "So it's very easy for us to get way more sodium than we need. And it's very easy for us to get a dangerous amount of sodium that has some impact on our blood pressure or our overall health," he says.</p>



<p>The recommended daily limit of sodium is 2,300 milligrams, or about 1 teaspoon. Dr. Porter recommends reading food labels. And cut back on the saltshaker by using salt-free seasonings.</p>



<p>"Sometimes you can either stop or reverse some of the initial damage that happens with chronic kidney disease. The longer that the process goes on, the more severe it is, the less likely it is to be able to get back to healthy kidneys. And that's when we have to think about things to replace kidney function like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/dialysis-programs/overview/ovc-20464948?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dialysis</a> or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/kidney-transplant/about/pac-20384777?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transplant</a>," he says.</p>

Together, they are reimagining the future of skin patch testing.</p>



<p>The doctors have developed an app powered by an AI algorithm that enables patients to capture images of their own skin. The app then analyzes patch test results, which are validated by a healthcare professional to ensure the assessments are accurate.</p>



<p>The typical patch test is a lengthy, five-day process. Patients must visit a clinic to have the patches applied, then return on the third and fifth days for result readings, making the procedure time-consuming and inconvenient. The AI approach eliminates the need for multiple clinic visits, saving time for both patients and clinicians.</p>

<p>"The way that we are now approaching it is developing a better way to do this," said Dr. Allison Bruce.</p>



<p>This new method offers significant potential for both simplifying the process and expanding access to skin patch testing. Additionally, the app is designed to recognize diverse skin tones, delivering more accurate and personalized results.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> It seems like no matter what I do, I can't lose weight. Most of my family members struggle with their weight too. Do our genetics play a part in this?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> It's important to understand that we are all unique and gain weight for many different reasons. When trying to understand weight gain and why some of us have difficulty losing weight, there are factors such as gut and brain connections, how we control our sensation of hunger and fullness and how long we stay full. Over a decade of studies at Mayo Clinic have helped identify characteristics that can be associated with groups of people called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/science-saturday-researchers-explore-personalized-approach-to-anti-obesity-medications/">obesity phenotypes</a>. </p>



<p>Each phenotype has a single genetic predisposition (an increased likelihood of developing <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-health-consequences-of-obesity/">obesity</a> based on a person's genetic makeup) and interacts differently with their environment. In many environments we see today, there is an excess of food, and we're less active than before. Some people may feel hungry between meals, while others only have one big meal a day — our genetics drives this. Your genetic makeup determines which phenotype you're going to have. These phenotypes can help guide treatment for weight loss. Each of these genetic phenotypes, or genotypes, identifies the type of obesity and which medication would work best. </p>



<p>The first phenotype is what we call "hungry brain." These patients start eating and don't feel full even after consuming large meals with second and third helpings. Usually, this runs in families. The other phenotype is what we call "hungry gut." These patients start eating and feel full after their usual portion, but the gut does not send those signals to the brain. Because of that, they feel hungry between meals. Signals from the gut to the brain are hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). Semaglutide medications such as Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus work on behalf of the GLP-1 hormone. They connect between the gut and the brain, and they signal to the brain that you're full. </p>



<p>Patients who have emotional hunger are another group. Whether having a good or bad day, these patients look to cope with life by eating food. The fourth group is patients with a "slow burn" or abnormal metabolism where the body does not burn all the calories they consume. </p>



<p>Looking at these four phenotypes can help individualize obesity therapy. How genes correlate with an obesity phenotype can help determine which medications should be prescribed. Each of us also should have a unique diet approach based on our genotype and phenotype. Many diets have mainly focused on obesity-related complications, such as managing Type 2 diabetes or preventing heart risk, but none have been customized to phenotypes. The concept of the phenotype-tailored diet came from multiple studies that showed metabolic benefits during and after the diet plan began. These findings were then matched to each phenotype to define recommended diets.</p>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, we work closely with our colleagues in bariatric surgery through endoscopic procedures to find out, based on our genetics, how we can identify who will be the most responsive to each course of action. We want to bring precision medicine as we have for any other disease, and I think it's time we do the same for obesity. <em>—</em> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/acosta-andres-j-m-d-ph-d/bio-20166892"><strong><em>Andres Acosta, M.D., Ph.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, </em></strong><strong><em>Bariatrician, Gastroenterologist, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-recognized-as-worlds-best-hospital-by-newsweek-for-the-seventh-straight-year/">Mayo Clinic recognized as 'World's Best Hospital' by Newsweek for the seventh straight year</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic has again received the No. 1 ranking in Newsweek's list of the "World's Best Hospitals." This is the seventh straight year Mayo Clinic has received the top ranking.</p>



<p>"This continued recognition is a tribute to our dedicated staff who consistently deliver unparalleled, compassionate care to our patients," says Gianrico Farrugia, M.D., president and CEO of Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-and-heart-health/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Sleep and heart health</a></h2>



<p>Does how much you sleep affect your heart? According to health officials, adults who sleep fewer than seven hours each night are more likely to experience health problems.</p>



<p>Dr. Juan Cardenas Rosales, an internal medicine physician at Mayo Clinic, stresses that adequate sleep is crucial for your overall well-being, including your heart health.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-know-the-warning-signs-of-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Know the warning signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</a></h2>



<p>It's often silent but can be a deadly killer. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a genetic condition that occurs in 1 in 500 people.</p>



<p>Dr. Said Alsidawi, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says the problem is that many people don't even know they have it because they have no symptoms. And in many cases, the first presentation is sudden cardiac death. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-researchers-find-caregiving-worsen-menopause-symptoms/">Researchers find caregiving worsens menopause symptoms</a></h2>



<p>In a first-of-its-kind study, Mayo Clinic researchers found that women 45–60 years old who are managing family caregiving and menopause face nearly double the risk of moderate to severe menopause symptoms. Women in the sandwich generation are especially affected. The sandwich generation is a term used for people who often juggle caring for both children and aging adults, balancing responsibilities like feeding, cleaning and medical care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-drug-may-reduce-need-for-aortic-valve-surgeries-by-slowing-disease-progression/">New drug may reduce need for aortic valve surgeries by slowing disease progression</a></h2>



<p>Researchers at Mayo Clinic are exploring the use of a new drug called ataciguat to manage aortic valve stenosis. Results from preclinical and clinical studies, published in Circulation, show that ataciguat has the potential to significantly slow disease progression. The final step to establish the drug's long-term effectiveness and safety is a phase 3 trial, and efforts to launch that pivotal trial are soon to be underway with an industry partner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-high-triglycerides-mean-and-why-it-matters-to-your-heart/">Mayo Clinic Minute: What high triglycerides mean and why it matters to your heart</a></h2>



<p>You may be familiar with high-density lipoproteins (HDL), or good cholesterol; low-density lipoproteins (LDL), or bad cholesterol; and their connections to heart health. But what about triglycerides? Often that word gets skimmed over when talking about cholesterol levels.</p>



<p>Dr. Regis Fernandes, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, says triglycerides provide the body with energy from food. High levels can indicate signs of other conditions, like diabetes or prediabetes, that can increase the risk of heart disease and stroke.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/5-things-to-know-about-fainting-the-hearts-role-and-when-it-may-signal-serious-condition/">5 things to know about fainting: The heart's role and when it may signal a serious condition</a></h2>



<p>You may have heard that people who feel faint should sit with their heads between their knees, but is that true? And how can you tell whether you or someone else who has fainted should go to the emergency department or perhaps even see a cardiologist? ⁠<br>⁠<br>Dr. Elijah Behr, a cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London, explains five things it is important to know about fainting.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-5-things-to-know-about-stroke/">Mayo Clinic Q and A: 5 things to know about stroke</a></h2>



<p>A stroke can happen at any time and to anyone. You might be talking to your loved one and notice they're suddenly slurring their words. Or, while grocery shopping, you realize you can't move your hand to pick up a jar from the shelf. You can go from feeling as usual to feeling sick within a matter of seconds to minutes. Here are five key things to know about stroke.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hope-for-ovarian-cancer-new-immunotherapy-target/">Hope for ovarian cancer: New immunotherapy target</a></h2>



<p>In a study published in Science Advances, Mayo Clinic researchers found a new immunotherapy target called a cryptic antigen that may be key in helping the immune system fight tumors in ovarian cancer.⁠<br>⁠<br>Cryptic antigens are part of a protein — known as epitopes — that are usually hidden or inaccessible to the immune system and may be present in tumor cells.⁠<br>⁠<br>Researchers will explore cryptic antigens in designing new treatments, such as vaccines or immunotherapies, that could help the immune system target tumors more effectively. ⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-struggling-with-ibs-symptoms/">Mayo Clinic Q and A: Struggling with IBS symptoms?</a></h2>



<p>Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is common and affects approximately 1 in 10 adults in the U.S. IBS is characterized by abdominal pain with disordered defecation (constipation, diarrhea or both). IBS can generally be easily treated with a combination of education, reassurance, diet and medications.</p>
