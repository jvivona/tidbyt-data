<p-->How does someone deal with a diagnosis of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple sclerosis</a> (MS), a potentially disabling disease that attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord?<p></p>



<p>For <a href="https://www.maylingkopecky.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May Ling Kopecky</a>, who was diagnosed with MS at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> as a teen, making art and music helps her share what it's like to live with a chronic disease.</p>



<p>"When I'm playing music, I feel like I'm able to just let myself express these things without really thinking too hard about it because it just comes out," says May Ling, now 30, playing a Beethoven piece at the piano, one of the roughly dozen instruments she plays.</p>



<p>Music and art infuse the Kopecky family home in Plymouth, Minnesota. String instruments line the living room across from the piano, and original artwork decorates the walls. May Ling's studio is down the hall.</p>



<p>"I've been drawing and painting since before I can remember," she says, pencil in hand.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Multiple sclerosis diagnosis</strong></h2>



<p>May Ling vividly recalls when MS entered the picture. "The first clear <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20350269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS symptom</a> that I had was when I was 13. I would bend my head forward, and I would get this electric buzzing sensation in my neck and spine," she says, describing a symptom known as Lhermitte's sign.</p>



<p>Like some MS symptoms do, that buzzing stopped in a few weeks. But at age 15, muscle spasms in her torso prompted May Ling's parents to bring her to Mayo Clinic, where a neurological exam and imaging tests led to an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/multiple-sclerosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MS diagnosis</a>.</p>



<p>"Multiple sclerosis is called a demyelinating disease," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/flanagan-eoin-p-m-b-b-ch/bio-20149754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Eoin Flanagan</a>, May Ling's neurologist. "The myelin is the insulation that goes across the nerves. What happens in multiple sclerosis is your immune system attacks that myelin and tears it away, and then the nerves don't work as well. That can be in the brain, within the spinal cord or within the optic nerves."</p>



<p>The attacks cause nerve inflammation and swelling that damage nerve fibers. The damage leads to scarring, or sclerosis, visible as white lesions on MRI scans of the brain and spinal cord.</p>



<p>That damage can cause symptoms such as vertigo, vision loss, and numbness or weakness, typically on one side of the body.</p>



<p>Sitting at the piano, trying to remember a musical score, May Ling describes brain fog, another MS symptom. Double vision, fatigue and heat intolerance also are among her challenges. Her thermal, insulated bottle with ice water is a constant companion.</p>



<p>Through her art, May Ling shares what others may not see. "Through painting my MRI scan, I'm also coming to terms with the fact that, OK, this isn't a fake symptom. This is real because I'm looking at the damage," says May Ling, who works in disabilities services in higher education.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>New treatments for multiple sclerosis</strong></h2>



<p>About 2.8 million people in the world have MS, according to the <a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/about-the-society/who-we-are/research-we-fund/ms-prevalence" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Multiple Sclerosis Society</a>.</p>



<p>May Ling has the relapsing-remitting form of MS, marked by symptom attacks and remission periods. This form often leads to secondary-progressive MS with symptoms worsening over time. Newer disease-modifying medications are suppressing MS attacks for many patients.</p>



<p>"With the new stronger medications that we have for MS, we're really seeing a great hope for our patients," Dr. Flanagan says, noting a decrease in patients relapsing and getting new lesions.</p>



<p>May Ling has had a similar story. "Her MRIs have been stable, and she's not had any new attacks or new relapses," Dr. Flanagan says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gait monitoring to detect early MS changes</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396372" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-gait-test-image.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Gait testing is helping clinicians look for early clues to patients' MS symptoms, with the goal of intervening before problems worsen.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the goal of early intervention to prevent problems, clinicians also are incorporating gait monitoring to look for clues to patients' worsening MS symptoms.</p>



<p>Lack of coordination and unsteady walk are common MS symptoms. In gait monitoring, patients wear sensors on their arms, legs and chest while walking. Data collected may provide information about hard-to-detect changes.</p>



<p>"With gait monitoring, we can see it and track it along, and then we can make treatment adjustments or maybe add in a different treatment to try to prevent that worsening," Dr. Flanagan says.</p>



<p>May Ling had her gait monitored at a recent appointment. "When I was being tested, I was like, 'Oh, I'm kind of walking on this foot weird sometimes, aren't I?'"</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Managing multiple sclerosis at all ages</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="436" height="563" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-blurry-vision-IV-painting.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396276" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-blurry-vision-IV-painting.jpg 436w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/May-Ling-Kopecky-blurry-vision-IV-painting-232x300.jpg 232w" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">This piece by May Ling Kopecky shows the viewer what it's like to have double vision.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>For May Ling, Mayo Clinic has been a trusted healthcare partner for more than a decade as she learned how to manage her chronic disease.</p>



<p>"All the doctors explained things in a way that, as a teenager, I could understand," she says. "Because I had a good experience, I decided to, even as now an adult patient, continue going there. All my neurologists have been really good about telling me exactly what MS is and what sort of treatments there are and explaining (my) MRI scans."</p>



<p>MS sometimes is called an invisible illness. To counter that, May Ling's realistic drawings and paintings invite discussion about living with a chronic illness by showing others, for example, what it's like to have double vision. She exhibits her work regionally and nationally.</p>



<p>"I'm communicating with the viewers about, you know, what my experience is," May Ling says. "I always find it super rewarding when somebody else comes up to me and says something like, 'I see myself in this work.'"</p>

<p>For the first time in the U.S., <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/monitoring-the-h5n1-avian-influenza-bird-flu-outbreak/">H5N1 avian influenza</a>, commonly known as the bird flu, has been detected in a pig. The virus is widespread among wild birds globally. It continues to cause outbreaks in American poultry and dairy cows, and it has infected humans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/bird-flu/situation-summary/index.html">reports</a>&nbsp;46 confirmed human cases of bird flu in the U.S., all linked to animal exposure with "no evidence of human-to-human transmission."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pigs and flu viruses </h2>



<p>Pigs are particularly concerning because their airways can be infected by both human and avian influenza viruses. Dual infections increase the risk of the viruses mixing and creating a new strain.</p>



<p>"It's important because influenza, both human strains and avian strains, have what's called a segmented genome, so the genome is broken up into different parts. If, by a rare occurrence, an animal or a human becomes infected with two different types of influenza virus and those viruses happen to infect the same cell, there's a chance that the segmented genomes can become reassorted, and it can lead to the production of a brand-new virus," he says.</p>



<p>While most novel viruses do not spread efficiently from person-to-person, there is a rare chance that a new virus could develop the ability to spread and cause serious illness.</p>



<p>"Pigs are thought of as an evolutionary playground for influenza viruses because multiple types – human and avian – can infect them, potentially leading to these reassortment events and production of new viruses," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Antigenic drift and antigenic shift</h2>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says influenza viruses change in several ways. One is antigenic drift, which consists of small changes over time due to mutations that occur when the virus replicates.</p>



<p>"Antigenic drift is the reason why we need to get an annual flu shot every year. It's because the virus that's circulating right now will, through the process of replicating its RNA genome, mutate and change over the next six to 12 months," he says.</p>



<p>Antigenic shift is different.</p>



<p>"It's when an animal, such as a pig, becomes infected with two different influenza viruses at the same time. In the rare event that this happens, the viruses unpack their genome in the same cell, and in the process of making a new virus, the segmented genomes reassemble in a new way that leads to the production of a brand-new virus that the population might have never seen before. The proteins on the outside of the virus look completely different — or different enough where a human's immunity doesn't recognize it," explains Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Risk for U.S. food source</h2>



<p>Dr. Binnicker says the risk to food and dairy in the U.S. is currently low. However, there is a risk of illness from consuming unpasteurized milk and milk products.</p>



<p>"Do not consume unpasteurized milk and unpasteurized milk products because we know that some dairy cattle are infected with the virus, and there is some risk if you're consuming or eating unpasteurized products," he says.</p>



<p>Cooking pork thoroughly kills the virus, making it safe to eat.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How to protect yourself from avian flu infection</h2>



<p>There are steps you can take to reduce your risk of infection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/older-woman-receiving-a-vaccination-16-x-9-1024x576.jpg" alt="older woman receiving a vaccination" class="wp-image-80533" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/older-woman-receiving-a-vaccination-16-x-9.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/01/older-woman-receiving-a-vaccination-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>"The best thing you can do is get the influenza vaccination," he says.&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's beneficial for a number of reasons."</p>



<p>"One, it helps keep you from getting typical <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-mayo-clinic-expert-answers-common-questions-about-the-flu-covid-19/">human influenza</a>, which can be a very severe disease. Two, it helps prevent you from spreading influenza to other people. And then third, with circulation of avian influenza in birds and mammals, and now dairy cattle and even in pigs, it prevents the chance that we see a reassortment event," Dr. Binnicker says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He explains that vaccination reduces the chance of a human being infected by both avian and human flu strains, and it lowers the risk of spreading human flu to animals such as pigs, reducing the odds of a reassortment event that could lead to a novel virus.</p>



<p>Dr. Binnicker adds that anyone with a bird flock or a poultry or dairy facility should avoid contact with sick or dead animals to reduce the risk of infection, and if interaction is necessary, wear a mask, gloves and eye protection.</p>

<p>As a nurse practitioner at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, Angela Irizarry fully understands the health risks associated with excess weight, including the risk for diabetes and heart attack.</p>



<p>But those reasons weren't why she decided to make a change in her own life.</p>



<p>Angela had severe acid reflux and was tired of being in constant discomfort. She knew it was time to do something different.</p>



<p>Her positive experience working with patients in Mayo's weight management program led her to explore options for herself. She met with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/elli-fernando-f-m-d/bio-20192046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Fernando Elli</a> a Mayo Clinic bariatric surgeon, who helped her confirm that weight-loss surgery was the right decision for her.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Starting the bariatric surgery journey</strong></h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="225" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-225x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395641" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-225x300.jpg 225w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Angela-1536x2048.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"></figure></div>


<p>Like all people who choose <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/gastric-bypass-surgery/in-depth/weight-loss-surgery/art-20045334" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss surgery</a> at Mayo, Angela participated in a presurgical wellness program to build lifestyle skills she could use before and after surgery. She spent a lot of time working with the program coordinators, who helped her feel confident in her decision.</p>



<p>"The team walked me through each and every step," Angela says. "They know what you're experiencing, and they will help you through this journey in a really compassionate way." &nbsp;</p>



<p>Once the surgery was completed, Angela lost weight, but she also experienced a bonus benefit — her acid reflux went away. Today, she no longer has acid reflux or takes medications for it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Solid results</strong></h2>



<p>The amazing results Angela experienced from her <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/bariatric-surgery/about/pac-20394258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a> journey at Mayo motivated her husband, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/irizarry-alvarado-joan-m-m-d/bio-20055198" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Joan Irizarry Alvarado</a>, a Mayo Clinic internal medicine physician, to think about weight-loss surgery for himself.</p>



<p>According to Dr. Elli, it is common for couples to go through this experience and pursue surgery together.</p>



<p>"We have many couples who want to lose weight in order to improve their health and longevity," he says. "Having your life partner by your side throughout this process, supporting you every step of the way, often leads to great outcomes."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="280" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Dr._Irizarry-300x280.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395642" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Dr._Irizarry-300x280.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Dr._Irizarry-1024x955.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Dr._Irizarry-768x716.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Dr._Irizarry-1536x1432.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Before_photo_-_Dr._Irizarry-2048x1910.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>


<p>For Dr. Irizarry Alvarado, there were two other things that led him to consider bariatric surgery: seeing his pictures and wanting to be there for his family, especially his kids.</p>



<p>As self-described "Disney fanatics," their family loves to travel to the Magic Kingdom and go on Disney cruises. However, Dr. Irizarry Alvarado couldn't keep up with his family when walking throughout the theme park or on a cruise ship.</p>



<p>"My kids were at the set sail party on the cruise with the Disney characters, and I almost missed it while looking for an elevator because I couldn’t walk up the stairs to the party to meet them," he says.</p>



<p>After supporting his wife's lifestyle changes, he felt that he could make a similar change for himself, so he went through the program at Mayo, including surgery with Dr. Elli.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Life after bariatric surgery</strong></h2>

<p>About three years after surgery, Angela has lost 170 pounds, and Dr. Irizarry Alvarado has lost 125 pounds.</p>



<p>Their family still goes on Disney trips, but also travels regularly to other places these days — activities that seemed impossible a few years ago, like hiking a mountain in St. Lucia.</p>



<p>The couple says that partnering up for weight loss has been a positive for the entire family. Cooking nutritious meals at home has been a positive influence on their kids, and splitting meals when eating out is now a common occurrence.</p>



<p>"We enjoy so much more today, and it's amazing how many more things we can do now," Dr. Irizarry Alvarado says. "We are really living."</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><sub>Throughout her life, retired educator and social butterfly Lynn Maiman struggled to hear. After years of progressive hearing loss, bilateral cochlear implant surgery at Mayo Clinic in Florida restored her hearing and got her back to the busy social life and people she loves.</sub></em></p>



<p>A swim instructor, senior living consultant and retired educator, Lynn Maiman, 65, is a self-described people person. But for most of her busy and active social life, the Jacksonville, Florida, resident struggled to hear what was happening around her.</p>



<p>Like many people who experience hearing loss at a young age, it wasn't always obvious that she was missing something. Maiman explains that she didn’t piece together when her difficulty hearing began until much later in life.</p>



<p>"I remember when I was in high school, I asked my friends how they knew the words to different songs," Lynn says. "They told me they knew from listening to the radio. I didn't know there were lyrics because I could only hear the background music."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding ways to adapt</h2>



<p>Over time, Lynn found ways to cope with her hearing loss. She recalls sitting in the front row of massive lecture halls so that she wouldn't miss information during her college classes. Later, she began creatively filling in the parts of conversations she couldn't hear and, without realizing it, she began reading lips.</p>



<p>A gut check came when, after working for many years in a successful career centered around children, Lynn found she could no longer understand students when they spoke to her. When she was 50 years old, she had her hearing checked for the first time and was prescribed hearing aids.</p>



<p>"I lived with hearing aids for many years," Lynn says. "They really helped, until they just didn't anymore."</p>



<p>In 2019, Lynn learned she was a candidate for bilateral <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cochlear-implants/about/pac-20385021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cochlear implants</a>. Because she was afraid of the procedure and the possibility of losing what hearing she had left, she put it off. In the years that followed, Lynn began to experience balance and cognitive issues. She used a service dog to help her navigate daily living activities and struggled to maintain her social life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ready for the next step</h2>



<p>In 2023, Lynn decided it was time to revisit the possibility of cochlear implants.</p>



<p>"I made an appointment at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> to get a second opinion. That second opinion quickly became my first choice for treatment," Lynn says. "My care team made sure I understood all my options, and I felt very comfortable scheduling my surgery. I knew I was making the right decision."</p>



<p>Lynn’s surgeon, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/raymond-mallory-j-m-d/bio-20538468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mallory Raymond</a>, an otolaryngologist with specialized training in neurotology at Mayo Clinic in Florida, explains that cochlear implants improve both the clarity and volume of sound, which is different from hearing aids that only provide amplification.</p>



<p>"Our ability to connect with others through communication is at the core of what makes us human," says Dr. Raymond. "Hearing loss can lead to social isolation and cognitive issues. Fortunately, hearing is the one sense that we can restore if it's lost or diminished."</p>



<p>During a simple, outpatient procedure, cochlear implants are placed under the scalp behind the ear. Dr. Raymond says patients typically recover quickly, and the device is activated after a few weeks. An external processor attaches to the outside of the scalp with magnets, and the two components work together to transmit sound.</p>



<p>Once cochlear implants are activated, Dr. Raymond says the process of recovery and auditory rehabilitation begins. With the help of an audiologist, patients learn how to interpret the sounds transmitted by the implant, which are not as complex as what a person hears naturally.</p>



<p>When her first implant was turned on, Lynn says she cried because she didn't recognize what she was hearing as English. But with time and practice, she adapted to the new sounds, and now she can easily understand what she hears.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A life filled with sound</h2>



<p>"Lynn's progress with her implants is impressive, and her quality of life has greatly improved," says Dr. Raymond. "That's something I’m thrilled to have been a part of."</p>



<p>Less than one year after receiving her first cochlear implant, Lynn had her second implant placed and activated in late 2023.</p>



<p>A social butterfly once again, Lynn spends her time traveling, volunteering with service animals,&nbsp;offering swim lessons to children and people with disabilities,&nbsp;as well as playing and teaching mahjong. She is also passionate about her part-time work helping seniors find the services they need to age at home, something that wouldn't be possible without being able to hear or understand speech.</p>



<p>"I only wish I had gotten the implants sooner. The technology is amazing, and I'm able to do things that I couldn't do before," Lynn says. "I can hear birds now, and I haven't heard that for a long time. I went skiing and could hear the woosh of other skiers coming up behind me. It's been amazing."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> Growing up, I was told to drink orange juice when I had a cold because "vitamin C is the cure." Does vitamin C actually help us when we're sick? What are its benefits?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-c/art-20363932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitamin C</a> supports our immune systems, helps our bodies heal wounds, protects our joints and contributes to <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-do-collagen-and-biotin-supplements-work/#:~:text=Collagen%20is%20concentrated%20in%20bones,content%20is%20made%20from%20collagen." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collagen</a> formation, the main protein in the body. Vitamin C is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/antioxidants/sls-20076428?s=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antioxidant</a> that helps protect your cells against what are called <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(12)64861-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free radicals</a>, which are produced when your body is exposed to potentially cancerous things like cigarette smoke and the sun's rays. Despite all these benefits, there is limited evidence to support the notion that taking extra doses of vitamin C can effectively prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common colds</a>.</p>



<p>For most people, taking a daily <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ascorbic-acid-oral-route/description/drg-20068031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oral supplement</a> of vitamin C via tablets, drink powders or gummies may not be that beneficial because you may be getting it from your diet naturally. Our bodies don't produce vitamin C on their own, but a lot of what we eat contains it. Citrus fruits may come to mind first when we hear vitamin C, but foods such as potatoes, spinach, tomatoes, berries and other brightly colored fruits and vegetables are full of the nutrient. Contrary to popular belief, an orange bell pepper has three times the amount of vitamin C than an orange.</p>



<p>It's important to get your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20050989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daily intake of fruits and vegetables</a>, but many people in the U.S. do not. A little bit of added vitamin C may actually help those individuals. In most cases, though, if you are able to access and eat an adequate supply of fruits and vegetables in your diet, that will be sufficient.</p>



<p>Some people may think they should double up on vitamin C supplements when feeling ill, but more is not always a good thing. Taking too much vitamin C can cause side effects that may make you feel worse, such as <a href="https://mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea, vomiting</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach cramps</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/in-depth/gas-and-gas-pains/art-20044739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bloating</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20373223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heartburn</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headaches</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/a-flushing-disorder-a-case-from-the-endocrine-teaching-clinics/mac-20429375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin flushing</a> and even <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney stones</a> in some people. Make sure you do not consume more than the recommended daily dose of 500 milligrams.</p>



<p>High levels of vitamin C can interfere with multiple kinds of medications and results of certain medical tests such as blood or glucose screening. Using vitamin C while taking <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/combination-birth-control-pills/about/pac-20385282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oral contraceptives</a> could potentially increase your estrogen levels. For patients undergoing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>, the use of antioxidants such as vitamin C might lessen the effect of the chemotherapy drugs.</p>



<p>Overall, taking vitamin C in the form of food is the best way to reap its benefits, but taking extra vitamin C, particularly for those with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-immunodeficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20376905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune system</a>, would not be harmful. Some limited research shows that vitamin C may prevent the duration of a virus, such as the common cold. So, if your cold lasts a week, taking vitamin C may reduce it by 13 hours, which isn't all that significant based on a few limited studies. Consult with your healthcare team to decide what's best for you. <em>—</em><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Jesse Bracamonte, D.O</em></strong></a><strong><em>., Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</em></strong></p>

<p>During certain seasons of the year, you may notice changes in your energy level, sleep and interest in activities.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" target="_blank">Seasonal affective disorder</a>, or&nbsp;SAD, is a type of depression that is related to the changes in seasons. Symptoms typically appear in the fall, continue through the winter months and eventually go away in the spring or summer.</p>



<p>Affective disorders are mood disorders that have an impactful change in emotions and affect. Affective disorders significantly affect feelings and responses to emotions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the possible causes of SAD?</h2>



<p>While the exact cause is unknown, it may be linked to the reduced amount of sunlight affecting the natural chemicals like serotonin and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/melatonin-use-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melatonin</a>&nbsp;in your body that determine mood and energy levels and regulate sleep.</p>



<p>SAD is not simply a case of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/seasonal-affective-disorder-not-just-the-winter-blues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter blues</a>, a condition that is more mild and common. SAD symptoms are severe enough to make it difficult to function in social, work and home environments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does SAD differ from other types of depression?</h2>



<p>SAD has a seasonal pattern, with recurring episodes happening more predictably during certain seasons — most commonly during the winter months. SAD can have a predictable pattern to depression, which is helpful for the management of the disorder.</p>



<p>The criteria for diagnosing SAD are similar to diagnosing major depression, with the seasonal pattern as a key indicator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is most at risk for experiencing symptoms of SAD?</h2>



<p>People who live in the northern half of the U.S., where daylight hours are shorter and there is less sunlight, are more at risk for SAD. It's estimated that about 1 in 20 people in the northern half of the U.S. could have symptoms suggestive of SAD.</p>



<p>While a person is not born with SAD, it's believed to run in families. It's more common in women, as are all depressive disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What symptoms indicate seasonal affective disorder?</h2>



<p>On average, SAD will last about five months of the year. Typically,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/seasonal-affective-disorder-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms&nbsp;</a>will develop in October and worsen around the end of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/how-to-manage-daylight-saving-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daylight saving time</a>, followed by a more drastic decline in November. January and February tend to be the months with the most severe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms of depression</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder to watch for include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>



<li>Feeling persistently tired and fatigued, including feeling a loss of energy nearly every day of the affected months</li>



<li>Feelings of worthlessness</li>



<li>Losing interest in things you would typically enjoy, such as hobbies and social activities</li>



<li>Persistently feeling down or sad</li>



<li>Sleep disturbances, which could include hypersomnia (sleeping too much) or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insomnia</a>&nbsp;(difficulty falling asleep)</li>



<li>Thoughts of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-crisis-develop-safety-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suicide</a></li>



<li>Weight changes, including weight gain or weight loss</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there treatments available for SAD?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Light therapy</h3>



<p>Bright&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/light-therapy/about/pac-20384604" target="_blank">light therapy</a>&nbsp;is considered an effective treatment for SAD. Research suggests that around half of people who use a bright light therapy box have good results with symptom reduction.</p>



<p>It's essential to meet with a healthcare professional familiar with bright light therapy to determine the type of device needed to be effective, how to correctly set it up and the length of time required in front of a light box.</p>



<p>Generally, the light box should provide an exposure of 10,000 lux of light and emit as little UV light as possible. The typical recommendation is to use the light box within the first hour of waking up in the morning for 20–30 minutes.</p>



<p>Some light boxes emit white light, and others emit blue light. There is no advantage to one color.</p>



<p>Talking with your healthcare team before using a light box is crucial if your skin or eyes are sensitive to light due to a medical condition or medication.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medications</h3>



<p>An antidepressant prescribed by a healthcare professional can be an effective treatment option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Physical activity</h3>



<p>Research has shown that exercising for 20 minutes at least three days a week has similar effectiveness to taking an antidepressant.&nbsp;Being active can help with serotonin production and boost your mood.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/tips-for-cold-weather-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercising outdoors</a>&nbsp;during daylight hours increases the effectiveness of the activity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</h3>



<p>CBT is an effective treatment for SAD and clinical depression. CBT helps people learn how to manage their symptoms of depression or reduce the severity of the symptoms. Talk with your primary care provider about CBT and how to find a provider skilled at delivering CBT for depression or anxiety.</p>



<p>Because SAD is tied to the changing seasons, the onset can be predicted, which sets a person up to better manage their symptoms. If you have SAD, there are preventive measures that you can put in place and steps you can begin taking before major depression develops.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Remember these tips:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be physically active.</strong><br>Exercise helps relieve stress and anxiety. It's essential to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/winter-weather-are-falls-and-slips-avoidable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stay active during winter</a>, even if you are tempted to become less active during colder months.</li>



<li><strong>Get outside.</strong><br>Spend 15 to 20 minutes outside when the sun is out. If the weather allows, take a walk outside during the lunch hour when the sun is at its peak. Sunlight helps adjust your body's internal clock.</li>



<li><strong>Make your environment bright.</strong><br>Open the window blinds and allow sunlight into your home. Sit near a window while at home or work.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritize sleep.</strong>Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, with the goal of getting seven to nine hours of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep">restful sleep</a>. Excessive napping and oversleeping beyond your typical schedule can disrupt your circadian rhythm.</li>



<li><strong>Stay connected to friends and family.</strong><br>Decreased mood can lead to a behavior of staying home and isolating. Engaging with friends, staying in a routine, and getting active at home and outside of the home are essential.</li>



<li><strong>Take care of your body and mind.</strong><br>Eat regular, healthy meals. Avoid drugs and alcohol, which can make depression worse. Manage stress with practices like deep breathing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/mindfulness-meditation-improve-your-quality-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindfulness and meditation</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have a history of SAD, talk with your healthcare team about a plan to better manage your mood during the winter months.</p>

<p>Abbie Langton started dancing at age 3. Although she's trained across the spectrum of dance genres — including ballet, tap, hip hop and jazz — lyrical and contemporary are her favorites.</p>



<p>Abbie's passion for performing led her to receive a scholarship for competitive dance at a university in Connecticut. But during her sophomore year, debilitating pain in her arm and neck forced her to hang up her dance shoes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trouble finding a root cause</h2>



<p>Pain wasn't new to Abbie. When she was in the third grade, she remembers experiencing swelling in her left arm, along with chest pain. Because she was so young, though, she couldn't articulate what she was feeling.</p>



<p>"My doctor ordered a bunch of tests, worried it might be congestive heart failure because of the swelling in my left arm and chest pain," Abbie says. "The test results ended up being inconclusive, so my doctor decided it wasn’t congestive heart failure, which was great news, but we still didn’t know what it was."</p>



<p>Next, the focus turned to lymphedema, a chronic condition caused by a buildup of lymph fluid in the body that causes tissues to swell. Still, because of Abbie's young age, her doctor decided to forego testing to confirm a diagnosis and, instead, gave her a compression sleeve to wear to reduce the swelling.</p>



<p>Yet even with the sleeve, Abbie's pain continued.</p>



<p>"At every physical, I'd tell them that I was still experiencing pain, but they'd brush it off and keep pushing my concerns aside," Abbie recalls.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A life on hold</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignleft size-medium is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Langton_1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg" alt="Abbie Langton in a dance pose on a rooftop" class="wp-image-395540" style="width:377px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Langton_1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Langton_1-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Langton_1-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Langton_1-1x1-1.jpg 864w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></figure></div>


<p>By the time Abbie got to college, she'd learned to live with — and dance through — the pain. But during her second year of college, when she started experiencing severe pain in the back of her neck in addition to her arm and chest, Abbie's roommate told her she needed to get help.</p>



<p>"My roommate told me, 'This isn't normal. You need to go somewhere,'" Abbie says.</p>



<p>Abbie started with an orthopedic doctor in Connecticut, who sent her to a vascular surgeon, who eventually recommended a doctor in Boston.</p>



<p>"That was the beginning of the downward spiral of medical appointments," Abbie says. "I was getting really frustrated. I felt like my entire life was on hold. I couldn't dance. I couldn't really work. I couldn't sit at a desk for a long period of time. And at 20 years old, that was my entire life — I was a student and a dancer, and I couldn't do either well. My mental health was plummeting."</p>



<p>Abbie heard from the doctor's office in Boston that they couldn't get her in for nine months. Although she lives in Massachusetts and attends school in Connecticut, Abbie started looking into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>. Her parents had recently bought a vacation home near the Jacksonville campus, and Abbie was at her wit's end.</p>



<p>Everything Abbie read about Mayo Clinic was positive. When she called, she was able to get an appointment quickly — much sooner than the nine months the Boston doctor's office had offered.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding help at Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>Right away, Abbie's experience with Mayo Clinic matched everything she'd read about it.</p>



<p>"It's different from any other medical institution," she says. "For one, they didn't treat me like a hypochondriac. At that point, because I was young and petite and looked healthy, I felt like so many people were looking at me and assuming I just wanted attention, despite me saying over and over again that I had chronic pain."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sam Farres</a>, chief of the Vascular Surgery Division at Mayo Clinic in Florida, and his team, which includes Michael Adalia, nurse practitioner, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/clendenen-steven-r-m-d/bio-20054680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Steven Clendenen</a>, anesthesiologist, ordered a full-body workup. The first discovery was a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiari malformation</a>, which occurs when the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal. The second was <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, or TOS, a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>Dr. Farres says TOS is hard to diagnose. But it starts with believing what the patient tells you — and then performing a series of tests to rule out everything other than TOS.</p>



<p>Once Dr. Farres and his team had collected enough evidence that pointed to TOS, they started treatment: a nerve block followed by a rib resection (or removal of a rib) and scalenectomy (or removal of the scalene muscle, which passes through the thoracic outlet).</p>



<p>"I really trusted Dr. Farres," Abbie says. "He educated me a lot, taking the time to make me feel comfortable and explain things to me in a language I could understand. And he was the first person to say, 'This is what's wrong, and this is what we’re going to do about it.' He knew how important getting back to living my life was."</p>



<p>Dr. Farres points to TOS as a condition that steals people's passion. "It depletes their life's meaning, their identity," he says. "It can be very life-limiting."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reclaiming her life</h2>



<p>Just two weeks after her surgery, Abbie returned to school. A few months later — because she wasn't able to lift weights or dance yet — she took up long-distance running, participating in 5Ks and other endurance events.</p>



<p>"I needed to do something active," Abbie says, noting that, just recently, at age 21, she was able to start dancing again. "I probably could've started a little bit sooner, but I didn't want to push myself."</p>



<p>Overall, Abbie says she's in a much better place today.</p>



<p>"I either saw or talked with close to 20 doctors in my pursuit of answers to my pain," she says. "I always knew something was wrong. And it was so defeating to hear time after time that it must be in my head. It wasn't until Mayo Clinic that I found answers and help."</p>

<p>Each year, an estimated 15 million people around the globe experience stroke, according to the World Health Organization, with one-third resulting in death. When the symptoms of stroke present, calling 911 and seeking care immediately is the most crucial step to prevent disability or death.⁠</p>

<p>Treatment for breast cancer can come in many forms. In addition to surgery to remove cancerous tissue and radiation therapy, breast cancer also is commonly treated with drugs that are taken orally or intravenously, as an infusion into a vein.</p>

<p>Stomach pain is something everyone has probably had at some point in their life. But for Jessie Boyd, her stomach pain set in motion a journey that led her to Mayo Clinic and the experts who could perform a lifesaving surgery.⁠</p>

<p>Doctors at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic&nbsp;used a new catheter-based approach to draw out resistant pockets of infection that settle in the heart, known as right-sided&nbsp;infective endocarditis, without surgery. The research is part of a Mayo Clinic-led study across 19 U.S. sites involving patients who were not good candidates for surgery and whose right-sided heart infections had not responded to antibiotics.</p>

<p>Lifesaving cancer therapies can cause serious side effects, both immediately and later in life. With breast cancer rates rising among younger people, the need for treatments that provide excellent outcomes with fewer side effects is only increasing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shraddha's Story</strong></h2>



<p>It was November 2022, just a month shy of her 28th birthday.</p>



<p>Shraddha was wrapping up another day at the medical clinic where she worked as an occupational therapist. Shraddha's job was to help patients regain the ability to perform day-to-day activities following a health challenge like a surgery.</p>



<p>Suddenly that afternoon, Shraddha became the patient who needed help.</p>



<p>"My co-worker looked at me and said, 'Why is your hand all purple and blue?'" Shraddha says. She admits she had been feeling exceptionally tired as of late, but attributed it to a thyroid condition.</p>



<p>Her co-worker checked Shraddha's vital signs and found her blood oxygen level was dangerously low. "I remember her saying, 'If this is right, you wouldn't even be standing.'" A repeat test showed the same result. "The next thing I remember was we were on our way to the hospital," says Shraddha.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">

<p>At the hospital doctors began looking for the cause of Shraddha's low blood oxygen level.  A series of tests traced Shraddha's condition all the way back to the day she was born.</p>



<p>"When I was born, doctors said I had fatty liver, but they didn't know why so they called it 'undiagnosed,'" says Shraddha. "The doctors thought it wouldn't be a problem because the liver has a tendency to heal itself." It didn't. Shraddha grew up seemingly in perfect health, unaware that her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/the-silent-liver-disease-experts-warn-is-on-the-rise-among-hispanics-and-children/">liver disease</a> was silently doing damage to her body.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A little girl with a big dream</strong></h2>

<p>Shraddha was born in Mumbai, India which is often called the "City of Dreams." At a young age, Shraddha had big dreams of her own.  She wanted to pursue a career in the medical field that would allow her to help others. </p>



<p>Every year Shraddha went to the doctor for her routine physical. Each time she was given a clean bill of health. "I used to do blood tests, but everything always looked good," says Shraddha. Still, the question of what caused her congenital liver condition lingered in her mind.</p>



<p>"I didn't have a family history of any liver condition. I've never had alcohol in my life," says Shraddha. "There was always a question mark. I needed to find out why this happened to me."</p>



<p>At 23, Shraddha became the first person in her family to leave India and go to the U.S. to attend college. She studied occupational therapy and got her master's degree at the University of Southern California. After college, Shraddha found her dream job at a medical clinic in California.</p>

<p>All was going well until Shraddha began to noticed she was unusually tired. "When my sister came to visit she noticed I got tired after walking short distances. I went to the doctor and they thought maybe it was my thyroid," recalls Shraddha.</p>



<p>Then came the day her hands turned purple and her blood oxygen level mysteriously dropped. "My co-worker is a nurse so she got the oximeter and checked and it was 78%," says Shraddha. "And I was like, No, that's not possible because I wouldn't be alive." Shraddha's co-worker checked again, looked at the reading and said, "That's it, you have to go to the hospital."</p>



<p>A series of tests at the hospital revealed shocking results. Shraddha's liver condition had silently led to a more serious condition called hepatopulmonary syndrome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hepatopulmonary syndrome</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hepatopulmonary syndrome</a> is caused when liver disease shunts blood away from the lungs preventing the body from getting the appropriate amount of oxygen. Doctors told Shraddha the only way she would survive is with a liver transplant. However, she says she was told her condition was so severe and the risk so high, that she would likely not survive a transplant.</p>



<p>She was denied the transplant and given less than a year to live.</p>



<p>"I told the doctors 'that just can't be. I can't have just one year with nothing to bring to this world. I have not served my purpose,'" recalls Shraddha. </p>



<p>Refusing to give up, Shraddha turned to Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</p>



<p>"More than 40% of her blood was being shunted away from her lungs. Because of that she had extremely low oxygen levels in her blood," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20203899?customer_id=173-378-9621&amp;mc_id=google&amp;campaign=20718088499&amp;geo=9030070&amp;kw=transplant%20center%20arizona&amp;ad=678670770145&amp;network=g&amp;sitetarget=&amp;adgroup=158054873227&amp;extension=&amp;target=kwd-1284412548384&amp;matchtype=p&amp;device=c&amp;account=1733789621&amp;invsrc=transplant&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1bPG-JO5iQMVrjYIBR0f-AKlEAAYASAAEgKkU_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</a> "Shraddha's case was one of the most severe cases of liver disease and hepatopulmonary syndrome."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving Shraddha</strong></h2>



<p>The liver transplant was Shraddha's only hope for survival. "Without a transplant, this disease was progressive and fatal. We don't like to use this word, but it is a very progressive disease," says Dr. Aqel. "There was no other cure than a liver transplant."</p>



<p>Dr. Aqel and his multidisciplinary team of experts at Mayo Clinic went to work on a strategy to save Shraddha. The team came up with a plan using a combination of some of the latest cutting-edge technologies in medicine. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"<strong>Liver in a box</strong>"</h2>



<p>Transplanting any organ is a race agains the clock. Every second the donor organ is outside the body it begins to break down. Surgeons only have a limited time window to transplant the organ. Due to the complexity of Shraddha's case, Dr. Aqel's team knew they would need extra time. They decided to use one of the latest medical breakthroughs in transplant often referred to as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-liver-in-a-box-is-saving-lives-with-new-technology/">"liver in a box."</a></p>



<p>Traditionally donor organs are kept cold until transplanted. "Liver in a box" uses a warm organ preservation method. The organ is placed in a container that pumps oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood through the liver simulating conditions in the human body. The innovative perfusion system gives surgeons more time to perform the transplant. </p>



<p>"Having the donor "liver in a box" allowed the donor liver to stay healthy while we performed this complex surgery," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>Currently, this warm perfusion technology is primarily being used for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/heart-transplant-innovation-new-heart-in-a-box-technology-provides-gift-of-life-to-arizona-man-as-couple-prepares-to-celebrate-50-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart, lungs and liver transplants</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving lives with mobile ECMO</strong></h2>



<p>The next challenge was how to keep Shraddha's blood oxygen levels stable after her transplant. Dr. Aqel's team turned to a device called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/young-patient-with-covid-19-recovering-after-hospital-stay-ecmo-support/">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO</a>. The device often is used when the lungs aren't working properly. ECMO helps with the appropriate gas exchange that must occur to keep the body's blood oxygen level safe.</p>



<p>"It helps in getting oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood through the machine," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sen-ayan-m-d/bio-20055718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ayan Sen, M.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic's Intensive Care Unit in Arizona. "It helped us while her lungs recovered after her transplant."</p>



<p>The Mayo team also used one of the newest advancements in ECMO where the device is mobile. </p>

<p>"The best part of the mobile ECMO was that we do it in a way where she could actually walk around with the machine so that we could continue with her physical therapy, which is so important for the healing process after such a complex surgery," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Shraddha was in the ICU for nearly two months. With mobile ECMO she walked nearly every day.</p>



<p>Dr. Sen says mobile ECMO has proved to be a game-changer in critical cases like Shraddha's.</p>



<p>"It is technology that has really expanded from what surgeons do when they do heart surgeries and transplants where now we can do this to save lives at any place that is not a complex environment, like the ICU or the operating rooms," explains Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Mobile ECMO has become a lifesaving medical breakthrough for many patients.</p>

<p>"It has enabled us to raise the bar when it comes to saving people, who, until now, could not have been saved in the absence of this heart-lung machine," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>A team of highly specialized experts escorted Shraddha on her daily walks, meticulously monitoring her vital signs. Each step required Shraddha to muster every bit of strength she had.</p>



<p>"From the first day, I thought even if it pains me, if it hurts, even if it feels impossible, I still need to put that step forward to do something better today than yesterday," recalls Shraddha. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Mayo's mission is now my purpose'</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two years after her harrowing experience, Shraddha is healthy and back at work. She continues her daily walks, only now, at the beach, in solitude, reflecting on how her own experience can make her a better healthcare professional.</p>

<p>"Mayo Clinic doesn't like to say no. They set out to achieve the unachievable," says Shraddha. "My goal is to treat patients as they do, making them a priority."</p>



<p>Shraddha says words of thanks alone are not enough to convey her gratitude.</p>



<p>"Dr. Aqel and his team achieved something for me that everyone else thought was impossible," says Shraddha. "It was a gift. I will keep the mission of Mayo Clinic in mind when I am serving my patients. My purpose now is to put forward their purpose and help someone else."</p>
