<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> When the holidays end, it's hard to have things to look forward to and find motivation to exercise. How can I stay ahead of the slump and help my family stay active?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> As winter settles in, shorter days and colder nights can feel dull. But the mystery of winter nights also offers opportunities for fun, joy, connection and adventure through outdoor activities. Winter nights can be turned into an enchanting experience.</p>



<p>Dressing appropriately is the key to embracing nighttime winter fun in&nbsp;colder climates&nbsp;based on the activity and weather. This may include layers, a hat and mittens or gloves. Don't forget to check the weather forecast.</p>



<p>Give these cold-weather activities a try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hiking.</strong> Many parks maintain trails for winter hiking and offer guided nighttime nature events. Wear appropriate footwear or strap-on snowshoes. Stick to well-marked trails and take along water and a flashlight.</li>



<li><strong>Ice skating or sledding. </strong>Many cities offer outdoor rinks and designated sledding spots. Neighborhood hills or a DIY backyard rink can provide nearby fun. Check that rinks are well-maintained and choose sledding hills free of obstacles. Inspect your skates and sleds before using them and don't forget to wear helmets.</li>



<li><strong>Play tag or build snow creations.</strong> Playing in the snow brings laughter and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise</a>. Dress in layers to keep warm and dry, and take breaks indoors to warm up and avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/symptoms-causes/syc-20372656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frostbite</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Playground discovery.</strong> Playgrounds are fun year-round, even in winter. Try swinging or rolling snowballs down the slides for a new twist on winter playground fun. Watch for icy patches on equipment, and ensure the area is well-lit to avoid slips or falls in the dark.</li>



<li><strong>Stargazing.</strong> Winter nights often offer clearer skies, making it ideal for stargazing. Bring a blanket, download a star map app on your phone to enhance your viewing knowledge and pack warm beverages. Dress warmly, bring a flashlight, and let someone know your location if you're venturing to a remote spot.</li>
</ul>



<p>For those in warmer climates, winter nights offer unique opportunities to celebrate without the snow. Here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Beach bonfire or sunset picnic.</strong> Grab some blankets, pack snacks or an easy meal, and bring hot drinks to enjoy the evening. If you're setting up a bonfire, use designated fire pits and follow any local guidelines. Remember to bring flashlights or lanterns, and always pack out what you bring in to leave the area clean.</li>



<li><strong>Evening hike.</strong> Winter months offer cooler evenings that are perfect for exploring local trails. Many parks organize guided night hikes or special stargazing events. Stick to familiar trails and bring <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of water</a>, as nights in the desert or arid areas can be drier than expected. Always carry a flashlight or headlamp and let someone know your hiking route.</li>



<li><strong>Holiday light boat parade.</strong> Many coastal or lakeside communities organize holiday-light boat parades with boats decorated in festive lights. Bundle up and be sure to bring a flashlight to navigate docks and dark areas safely.</li>



<li><strong>Nighttime zoo or garden lights tour.</strong> Many zoos and botanical gardens offer night tours during the holiday season with sparkling lights and seasonal decorations throughout. Wear comfortable shoes and keep kids close by. Use designated paths and trails.</li>



<li><strong>Outdoor movie night.</strong> Set up a projector and screen in your backyard or a park. Relax with blankets, popcorn and hot chocolate or cider. Check the weather forecast for rain or wind and ensure everyone wears warm layers of clothing. Safely set up any heaters or lanterns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I'm 52 years old and enjoy long walks with my husband and our dog. I recently started to experience pain in my left calf during our walks. The leg pain goes away when I rest. Because I have a history of high blood pressure, I went to see my primary care physician and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. What is this condition, and what treatments are available? Will I need surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-peripheral-artery-disease-diagnosed/">Peripheral artery disease</a>&nbsp;is a common, chronic medical condition that affects circulation in the body due to narrowed arteries. The narrowing of arteries is caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, which reduces blood flow from the heart to different regions of the body. This can affect the arms, but most commonly, it is an issue found in the legs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of peripheral artery disease" class="wp-image-348220" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>The risk of developing peripheral artery disease increases with age, particularly for those over 65 or after 50 if you have certain risk factors. Factors that can contribute to your risk include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">High blood pressure</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">High cholesterol</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">Diabetes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521">Chronic kidney disease</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">Obesity</a>&nbsp;(a body mass index over 30)</li>



<li>Smoking tobacco/using tobacco products</li>
</ul>



<p>Many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, while others experience leg pain when walking or even at rest. The severity of your symptoms and the extent of the blockage are used to categorize the stage of your peripheral artery disease and inform specific treatment options.</p>



<p>There are two stages of peripheral artery disease. The early stage is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/claudication/symptoms-causes/syc-20370952">claudication</a>, when people experience pain when walking or engaging in activity. In this stage, the pain begins during exercise and ends with rest. It is usually felt in the calves, thighs and buttocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advanced, severe stage of peripheral artery disease is called critical limb threatening ischemia. During this stage, pain is often felt in the feet, even without walking, and is worse during rest or when lying down. You also may experience open sores or wounds on your limbs or feet that won't heal. Critical limb threatening ischemia may cause tissue death or gangrene on your feet. If this goes untreated, it can lead to leg amputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350563">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for peripheral artery disease varies depending on its severity. When it's diagnosed early, lifestyle changes and treatment of underlying medical conditions are often enough to manage symptoms. This may mean taking appropriate medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol, controlling blood sugar levels if you have diabetes, quitting smoking, eating a healthier diet with fewer fatty and highly processed foods, and regular exercise or engaging in a walking program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more advanced disease, restoration of blood flow is necessary in addition to lifestyle changes. Therefore, the goal of surgery is to restore blood flow and prevent leg amputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One treatment option is percutaneous endovascular surgery, a minimally invasive approach. In this operation, the surgeon guides a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the groin, foot or wrist to the narrowed part of the artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow. A stent, a small wire mesh tube, may also be placed in the artery to keep it open.</p>



<p>The more invasive surgical option is bypass surgery. The surgeon creates a path around the blocked artery using either a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic one. One end of the healthy vein is connected to the artery above the blockage, and the other is attached below the blockage so that the blood will detour into the bypass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, it’s important to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/vascular-and-endovascular-surgery/overview/ovc-20458819">consult a vascular surgeon</a>&nbsp;to determine the best treatment for you. Vascular surgeons can perform both minimally invasive procedures and complex bypass surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By incorporating lifestyle changes and treating any underlying medical conditions early, you can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent progression to more severe stages of disease. Peripheral artery disease is a marker for your overall cardiovascular health, and managing it correctly can lead to a longer, healthier life. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shuja-fahad-m-b-b-s/bio-20323775"><strong><em>Fahad Shuja, M.B.B.S.,</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;Vascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/st-sauver-jennifer-ph-d/bio-00027743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jennifer St. Sauver, Ph.D.</a>, the study's first author and professor of epidemiology at Mayo Clinic, says that the health of women in midlife is understudied, and comprehensive data about women between the ages of 40 and 59 are lacking.</p>



<p>"Most studies examine men and women together. However, we know that men and women age differently, so it's important to do separate studies to understand these differences," she explains.</p>



<p>Researchers know that hypertension and high cholesterol increase rapidly in both men and women during midlife. However, in this study, the researchers were surprised to see such a significant increase in sleep disorders, acid reflux and conditions related to joint and muscle pain in midlife women, according to Dr. St. Sauver.</p>



<p>Together, these data provide a picture of the most common health conditions that come to medical attention in midlife women and the most rapidly increasing, medically diagnosed conditions during the menopause transition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Key findings</strong></h2>



<p>Eight conditions became significantly more common and increased in women during midlife (ages 40-59).</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">

</ul>



<p>Black women and women living in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods were more likely to have many of these conditions. Black women were more likely to have high blood pressure and esophageal disorders (especially acid reflux) compared to white women across all age groups. Women living in more deprived neighborhoods had a significantly higher prevalence of high cholesterol, high blood pressure, sleep disorders and esophageal disorders.</p>



<p>"Our data provide a comprehensive picture of the most common conditions coming to medical attention in midlife women. They are useful for understanding common diagnoses in women during the menopause transition and suggest that additional attention should be focused on Black women and women with lower socioeconomic status to ensure that common midlife conditions are identified and addressed," says women's health researcher and coauthor <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/faubion-stephanie-s-m-d-m-b-a/bio-20199366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie Faubion, M.D.</a>, Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>The findings also underscore the need for increased research to understand underlying biological changes in women at midlife and how these changes contribute to the development of many conditions throughout the aging process. Such research may suggest future treatments that could be beneficial for multiple conditions. In addition, the findings highlight the need for increased attention to the health needs of Black women and women with lower socioeconomic status to ensure early diagnosis and treatment of common midlife health conditions.</p>



<p>The study used data from the Rochester Epidemiology Project in Minnesota, including medical records from approximately 1.4 million people in the Upper Midwest. Researchers analyzed data from 86,946 women between the ages of 40 and 59. They examined diagnoses recorded in electronic health records between 2016 and 2019.</p>

<p-->It's officially 2025. A new year offers new beginnings and an opportunity to reset your eating habits after the holidays.&nbsp;<p></p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-make-healthy-holiday-food-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea Delgado,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says it's best to eliminate what you don't need, including those party food leftovers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/aNno0RNCAnk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls="" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Reset-your-eating-habits-after-the-holiday-CLEAN.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:03) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/SCRIPT-MCM-Reset-your-eating-habits-after-the-holiday.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Is your refrigerator holding onto holiday leftovers? It's OK to let them go.</p>



<p>"What we want to do is, if we have any remaining food items or beverages that lingered after the holidays, we want to get rid of them," she says.</p>

<p>Either throw leftovers away or slowly eat them in smaller&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1">por</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tions</a>.</p>



<p>"We also want to slowly regress back to our old habits. Start introducing vegetables and fruits with most meals," says Delgado.</p>



<p>And pay attention to your food portion sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We don't necessarily have to go on a diet. We don't necessarily have to eliminate all of our foods. We just want to look at the portion sizes and the frequency that we have these foods," she says.</p>



<p>Opt for lean protein, whole grains and fresh produce in your diet, still allowing for an occasional treat.</p>



<p>"With nutrition, there is no all or nothing. We can still enjoy those nice treats, those good desserts, those savory beverages. It's all in how much and how often we are having them," says Delgado.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reset your eating habits with portion control</h3>



<p>Simplify your portion control by dividing your plate into three sections. This can assist you in making healthier food choices and managing your portions more effectively.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables</li>



<li>One-quarter: whole grains</li>



<li>One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</li>
</ul>

<p>Pregnancy is a time of significant change for a woman's body. Hormones fluctuate, energy levels shift and new challenges arise. One such challenge that some women face is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-long-term-health-risks-of-gestational-diabetes/">gestational diabetes</a>, a condition where blood sugar levels become elevated during pregnancy.</p>



<p>"In pregnancy, many things are changing in a woman's body. Her hormones are changing, and that's a lot of what leads to the initial nausea and vomiting and fatigue of pregnancy. These same hormonal shifts can also impact glucose control, leading to gestational diabetes in some women," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/allen-summer-v-m-d/bio-20055381">Dr. Summer Allen,</a> a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician who provides prenatal care.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is gestational diabetes?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gestational-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355339?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721">Gestational diabetes</a> happens when the body cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels during pregnancy.</p>



<p>"There are some women who will come into pregnancy having diabetes already, some with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011">type 1 diabetes </a>— autoimmune and genetically linked – and others with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193">type 2 diabetes </a>related to diet, activity and weight," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>While gestational diabetes often resolves after childbirth, it's important to understand its implications. "The important factor with gestational diabetes is after pregnancy, over that patient's lifetime, there is an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is at risk?</h2>



<p>Certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A family history of diabetes.</li>



<li>Being overweight before pregnancy.</li>



<li>Being over age 25.</li>



<li>A history of polycystic ovary syndrome.</li>



<li>Having had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Routine prenatal screenings typically identify gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. It's a reason why Dr. Allen says health screenings are important.</p>



<p>"The reason we recommend prenatal care is to screen for some of those conditions and to anticipate things that could lead to a complication for a woman in pregnancy. An example is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hypertension-in-pregnancy-poses-measurable-risks-for-babies/">high blood pressure.</a> Another may be an impact of glucose or sugar control in their pregnancy, such as diabetes," she explains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Managing gestational diabetes</h2>



<p>Gestational diabetes can have consequences for both mother and baby if not properly managed. For the baby, it may increase the risk of larger birth weight (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fetal-macrosomia/symptoms-causes/syc-20372579">macrosomia</a>), preterm birth or low blood sugar after delivery. For the mother, there's a higher risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745">preeclampsia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-section/about/pac-20393655">cesarean delivery</a> and developing type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>



<p>Managing this condition involves a combination of lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medical intervention. Dr. Allen recommends:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dietary adjustments: Try a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, vitamins and minerals, and monitor portion sizes to help regulate blood sugar levels.</li>



<li>Monitoring blood sugar levels: Frequent checks help ensure that levels remain within a safe range. Insulin or other medications may sometimes be required to maintain control.</li>



<li>Attending regular prenatal checkups: These visits allow healthcare professionals to monitor both mother and baby for any potential complications.</li>



<li>Staying active: Don't underestimate the power of a walk.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Going for a walk, even 30 minutes most days of the week, which can be broken up into 15-minute chunks or even 10-minute chunks, can make a big difference in decreasing chances of developing diabetes in pregnancy," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>Dr. Allen recommends the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/hlv-20049471">website</a> as a resource to help support a healthy pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My teenager received new headphones for Christmas while my preteen asked for a drum set. It's been a bit noisy around here. How can I protect their developing hearing?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20373072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing loss</a> often is thought of as something that happens to the elderly. But we live, work and play in a noisy environment, and hearing loss affects the lives of people of all ages.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing Health Foundation</a>&nbsp;reports that nearly 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from hearing loss in at least one ear, including 20% of teens. In younger children, hearing loss may be caused by playing with noisy toys.</p>



<p>Many toys that young children play with can produce levels equal to 90 decibels, which is as loud as or louder than a lawn mower. These levels typically require hearing protection. The volume can turn up as high as 120 decibels, which is as loud as an airplane taking off because kids often play with toys near their faces, ears and mouths.</p>



<p>Your child's ears are delicate, and every home with kids has its share of noisy toys. As a parent, it's a good idea to test toys in the store before buying. Test a toy's volume closer to your face, not at arm's length. Play like a child&nbsp;—&nbsp;hold the toy up by your ear, or crouch to a child's height and play with it on the ground. If a toy sounds too loud to you, it's too loud for your child. You can also research the Noisy Toys List from the&nbsp;<a href="http://sightandhearing.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sight &amp; Hearing Association</a>.</p>



<p>Here is a helpful guide for gifts:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Toys. </strong>Try placing clear tape over the speaker. Some tests have shown this lowers the sound level and may be safer for kids' ears. Every now and then, turn the sound off or down on audible playthings.</li>



<li><strong>Music and headphones. </strong>For children and teens glued to their music player or smart device, parents should stand near their child when they have headphones on and the music is playing. If you can hear the music, it's too loud. Output-limiting headphones are an excellent gift option. In most cases, they automatically limit the output level to about 85 decibels, which is a safe volume for up to eight hours. These headphones may be available at your healthcare provider location and through local and online retailers. Many devices, such as cellphones and tablets, have noise output-limiting settings that can be activated. You also can invest in custom earbuds or noise-canceling headphones that help block background noise, allowing you to decrease the volume.</li>



<li><strong>Instruments. </strong>Did someone receive an instrument for the holidays? These are fun, creative gifts, but there are things to consider so hearing isn't sacrificed to make music<strong>. </strong>For all musicians, but especially drummers, smart hearing healthcare is essential. Older musicians may benefit from musician earplugs that limit sound without compromising musical integrity. Drummers should try practicing with drum pads as much as possible. This will eliminate loud noises while still offering a surface for rehearsing stick strokes. Another approach is to limit practice to intervals. Try practicing, with ear protection, for 30 to 60 minutes, taking a break for the same amount of time to give your ears a rest, then going back to practice.</li>
</ul>



<p>Don't forget about hearing healthcare when you're shopping for gifts not only during the holidays but throughout the year — whenever your children receive toys. Make sure your gifts protect hearing and support healthy ears. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/katie-dease-aud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Katie Dease, Au.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Audiology, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/owatonna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Owatonna, Minnesota</em></strong></a></p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="760" height="428" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/Adult-Black-Woman-Smiling-16-x-9.jpg" alt="photograph of middle-aged Black woman in pink shirt, outside, smiling" class="wp-image-366395" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/Adult-Black-Woman-Smiling-16-x-9.jpg 760w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/Adult-Black-Woman-Smiling-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px"></figure>


<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Is breathing from your belly beneficial? If so, can you explain why and how to do it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;From the day you're born, you know how to breathe correctly. That means letting the diaphragm — the large, thin muscle just below the rib cage — do the work of drawing air into the lungs and letting it out. It's known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing, and it's the most efficient and effective way to breathe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time, almost everyone needs to remember how. Rather than belly breathing, people begin chest breathing. With chest breathing, the muscles between the ribs and the neck do the harder work of raising and lowering the rib cage to pull air into the lungs and push it out. Chest breathing requires a lot of effort and moves less air.</p>



<p>When it comes to the correct way to breathe, it doesn't matter whether you breathe through your nose or your mouth. Where you breathe from matters — your belly and not your chest.</p>



<p>Relaxed breathing should originate primarily from the diaphragm with little movement of the chest and shoulders. Chest breathing activates "accessory respiratory muscles" that tighten the neck, chest and vocal cords and can trigger a fight-or-flight stress reflex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A chest-breathing pattern is useful in short bursts when running from danger. However, prolonged chest breathing can contribute to coughing, hoarseness, tension headaches, chest tightness, shortness of breath and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belly breathing promotes a sense of calm relaxation. That's why it's typically part of mindfulness practices and yoga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 80% of people with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-are-you-coughing-so-much">chronic cough</a>&nbsp;have more than one factor contributing to symptoms. These can include postnasal drip,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940">gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a>,&nbsp;asthma, respiratory infections, throat dryness and inefficient chest breathing, which is an often-overlooked cough trigger.&nbsp;People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20351575">chronic coughs</a>&nbsp;tend to adopt inefficient breathing habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of these conditions can aggravate the other, and the cough may persist unless the person addresses all contributing factors at the same time.</p>



<p>Research has indicated that people with GERD who practice belly breathing after eating reduce how often they experience acid reflux.</p>



<p>People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631">sleep apnea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a>&nbsp;can find some relief with belly breathing, which helps them feel less short of breath and less anxious.</p>



<p>Belly breathing also can slow your heartbeat and lower or stabilize blood pressure.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/pain-rehabilitation-center/sections/overview/ovc-20481691">Pain Rehabilitation Centers</a>&nbsp;in Minnesota, Florida and Arizona help people experiencing chronic pain find ways to alleviate or control the pain. One way is by using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664">biofeedback</a>&nbsp;to train patients to relax and breathe with their belly, not their chest.</p>



<p>Medications can't correct chest breathing. The only solution is practice and patience. Most people can improve their breathing patterns with enough time and attention. As a bonus, you may end up with fewer headaches and less anxiety.</p>



<p>To determine how you breathe, try this simple test:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stand up straight or lie flat on a bed or the floor.</li>



<li>Put one hand flat on your chest, the other one flat on your belly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Watch your hands when you inhale and exhale. If you're chest breathing, the hand on your chest will go up and down.&nbsp;If you're belly breathing, the hand on your belly will go up and down.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other signs that&nbsp;<a>you're</a>&nbsp;chest breathing include frequent sighing and yawning, which indicate you're not getting enough air into your lungs.</p>



<p>Relearning how to belly breathe takes practice. If you've ever taken a yoga class or done a mindfulness exercise, those activities usually start with belly-breathing practice.</p>



<p>Begin your training by repeating the test throughout the day while lying down, standing or sitting with your back straight. As you get more comfortable breathing from your belly, you can try it when you're more active, such as walking. Then, build your way up to practicing belly breathing while engaging in more vigorous activities such as working out, running, mowing the grass or dancing.</p>



<p>Don't worry if you revert to chest breathing. Think about it this way: Chest breathing will get you there, just like crawling does. But neither is very efficient. As a toddler, you spend countless hours, with plenty of falls and tumbles, learning how to walk so you can get from point A to point B most efficiently. Like walking, belly breathing will become normal to you. Be patient with yourself.</p>



<p>Not only is diaphragmatic or belly breathing efficient and powerful, but it's also free and has no side effects. Embrace belly breathing, and your body and mind will thank you. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/richard-crockett-md"><strong><em>Richard Crockett, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Immunology &amp; Allergy Services, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato"><strong><em>Mankato</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/new-prague"><strong><em>New Prague</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Minnesota.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>You are pregnant. Now what?</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try to enjoy it, says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>"I start with that because it truly is an experience each time someone has a pregnancy," she says.</p>



<p>And then find a healthcare professional you trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Many of the initial things that someone experiences in pregnancy can be managed and cared for by their primary care clinician, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/morning-sickness/symptoms-causes/syc-20375254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea</a>&nbsp;and vomiting or giving them support with fatigue," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>Prenatal care helps screen potential complications.</p>

<p>An example is high blood pressure. Another may be an impact on glucose or sugar control in their pregnancy, such as diabetes," she says.</p>



<p>Strategies to stay healthy include taking a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-vitamins/art-20046945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prenatal vitamin</a>&nbsp;to balance what you might not be getting in your diet. And stay active. Walking can help. "Even 30 minutes most days of the week, which can be broken up into 15-minute chunks or even 10-minute chunks, can make a big difference on decreasing chances of developing diabetes in pregnancy," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>She says the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/hlv-20049471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic&nbsp;website</a>&nbsp;has additional resources,&nbsp;including a week-by-week guide on what to expect during pregnancy.</p>

Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/01/MCM_Can-vitamin-C-keep-the-common-cold-away.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Want to keep the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common cold</a> away this winter?&nbsp; Just drink more orange juice packed with vitamin C, right?</p>



<p>"We know that vitamin C does help your immune system function well. It helps with wound healing, helps with even collagen and joint protection, and even some tendon protection," says Dr. Bracamonte. "Overall, though, vitamin C taken in extra doses to prevent common colds hasn't proven true."</p>



<p>While it doesn't prevent you from getting a cold, Dr. Bracamonte says there is some limited research that additional vitamin C might speed up the recovery process slightly in some people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"So if you were going to have a common cold that lasts about seven days, it may cut it down about 13 hours," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says you should be getting an adequate amount of vitamin C if you're including fruits and vegetables in your diet. But if you want to pump up the vitamin C even more, you could try a daily supplement.</p>



<p>"Most cases, it's 500 milligrams of vitamin C. Too much of anything is not necessarily a good thing. You just want to be mindful of how much you're taking, and you're not exceeding the recommendations of the daily allowance," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says it's best to talk with your healthcare team before taking any new supplements.</p>
