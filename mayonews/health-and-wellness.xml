<p>Exercising as you age can be challenging. Sometimes it can feel like your body is breaking down. One possible reason for this could be senescent cells, which build up in your body as you get older and contribute to age-related disorders.</p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/glad257/7390642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> by Mayo Clinic shows that exercise and other physical activities can reduce the number of senescent cells.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lebrasseur-nathan-k-ph-d-m-s/bio-00055041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nathan LeBrasseur</a>, director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at Mayo Clinic, says people must prioritize physical activity, especially as they age.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aging and exercising</h3>



<p>There is no magic pill to reverse the aging process. But if you want to counter the biological mechanisms that drive age-related conditions, like the accumulation of senescent cells, you will need to exercise.</p>



<p>"Just being more active throughout your day appears to be sufficient to reduce kind of the burden of senescence cells in an individual," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Many people tend to lead sedentary lifestyles when they age. But Dr. LeBrasseur says older adults should find ways to become more active throughout the day.</p>



<p>"Dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>He says just adding 30 minutes of activity daily can be beneficial.</p>



<p>"(It) may have benefits for muscle strength or bone health, or maybe even cognitive health and function," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exercising can beneficial</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Controls weight.</li>



<li>Boosts energy.</li>



<li>Enhances cognitive function.</li>



<li>Promotes better sleep.</li>

He says the goal of screening is to detect prostate cancer early, when it's still confined to the prostate gland and has the best chance for successful treatment.</p>



<p>"It's important to get adequate screening, and screening for prostate cancer is relatively simple. You can have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/psa-test/about/pac-20384731?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, test</a> with your primary care doctor once a year, and with this, you can tailor adequate procedures based on your age and other risk factors," says Dr. Vargas.</p>



<p>The prostate-specific antigen test is a blood test used to measure the amount of prostate-specific antigen in your blood. High levels may indicate the presence of cancer. Other conditions also may increase this level. It's important to discuss with your healthcare professional if the prostate-specific antigen test is right for you based on your personal risk level and age.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video is available in the downloads at the end of the post. Please courtesy</strong>:<strong> Mayo Clinic News Network. Name super/CG: Carlos Vargas,  M.D/Radiation Oncology/Mayo Clinic</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is at risk?</h2>



<p>Risk factors include age, family history and race. The most common age is around 50 or older.</p>



<p>If you have a blood relative who has or has had prostate cancer or a family history of genes that increase the risk of breast cancer — BRCA1 or BRCA2 — or a strong family history of breast cancer, your risk of prostate cancer may be higher. In the U.S., prostate cancer is deadlier for Black men than men of other races, according to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/prostate-cancer-health-tip-sheet.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>. They are more likely to get prostate cancer and more than twice as likely to die from prostate cancer than other men.</p>



<p>"Early detection is very important. If we can find prostate cancer early, it is treatable and curable, " says Dr. Vargas.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Active surveillance</h2>



<p>Not all prostate cancers need to be treated, says Dr. Vargas. Some cancers can remain under <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/active-surveillance-for-prostate-cancer/about/pac-20384946?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">active surveillance</a>.</p>



<p>"When we find very early prostate cancer, we can watch it for many years. And in case that prostate cancer becomes more aggressive, then we can treat it there. The problem is when you are not screened, and then you find a very aggressive prostate cancer that is still localized or it has already metastasized, in which case, the chances of controlling the cancer, curing you and saving your life are much lower."</p>



<p>In active surveillance, regular follow-up tests may be performed to monitor the progression of your cancer.</p>



<p>"That's why screening is very important and why we encourage screening for prostate cancer. It doesn't mean that you must be treated. If prostate cancer is found, we can then determine what is the most appropriate course of action for your prostate cancer based on your age and your risk group."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options</h2>



<p>Along with active surveillance, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prostate-cancer/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353097?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full range</a> of treatments for prostate cancer is available, including radiation therapy; hormone therapy; cryosurgery; chemotherapy; and surgery, including robotic prostatectomy.</p>



<p><strong>"</strong>One of the things that has really changed over the last few years is the management of radiation with patients with metastatic prostate cancer," says Dr. Vargas. "We have found that many patients with metastatic prostate cancer still benefit from radiation to the prostate."</p>



<p>"And we have also found that many patients who have just a few sites of metastatic disease, meaning that the cancer is not widely spread, can also benefit from aggressive treatment where we do a combination of radiation therapy and systematic therapy to put you back in remission where disease cannot be found, and extend your life."</p>

Dr. Vargas says proton therapy is effectively used to treat patients with prostate cancer.</p>



<p>"It's a very localized treatment that allows us to treat the prostate, localizing the treatment to the prostate, hoping to minimize significant adverse events that may happen from the treatment," says Dr. Vargas.</p>



<p>Talk with your healthcare professional to learn more about prostate cancer screening and if it's right for you.</p>

<p>Hepatitis is inflammation in the liver caused by specific viruses. The hepatitis viruses are referred to as types A, B, C, D and E. All types affect the liver, but they differ in illness severity and prevention options.</p>



<p>In the U.S., the most common forms are hepatitis A, hepatitis B and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-c/symptoms-causes/syc-20354278?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatitis C</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Acute or chronic hepatitis B</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatitis-b/symptoms-causes/syc-20366802?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hepatitis B</a>&nbsp;is a serious disease caused by a virus that attacks the liver. It's one of the more common reasons for liver transplants in the U.S. Hepatitis B can be passed through blood, semen and other bodily fluids. Sneezing and coughing do not spread the virus.</p>



<p>For many people, hepatitis B is acute, or lasts less than six months. Acute infection may not need treatment and can be managed with rest, drinking plenty of fluids and monitoring of the infection.</p>



<p>For some people, however, hepatitis B can become chronic if it lasts more than six months. Chronic infection can go undiagnosed until symptoms of serious liver disease arise. Treatment for may include antiviral medications or a liver transplant if the liver is severely damaged.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When the hepatitis B virus becomes chronic, it can increase the risk of developing:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Lifelong infection</li>



<li>Cirrhosis, or scarring, of the liver</li>



<li>Liver cancer</li>



<li>Liver failure</li>
</ul>



<p>The risk of the infection becoming chronic increases the younger people are when they are infected with hepatitis B, particularly newborns or children under 5.</p>



<p>Although there is no cure for hepatitis B, getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent it.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Hepatitis B vaccine</h2>



<p>The hepatitis B vaccine usually is given as either a two-dose series spread out over one month or a three-dose series spread out over six months, depending on the vaccine used. Similar to the influenza vaccine, hepatitis B cannot be acquired from getting the vaccine.</p>



<p>The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) updated the&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/hepb.html" target="_blank">vaccine guidelines for hepatitis B</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The hepatitis B vaccine is recommended for:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Newborns</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/protect-your-child-with-proper-vaccinations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Children and adolescents not vaccinated</a>&nbsp;at birth</li>



<li>People who live with someone who has hepatitis B</li>



<li>People with chronic liver disease or end-stage kidney disease</li>



<li>Adults ages 19–59</li>



<li>Adults, 60 and older, with or without known risk factors for hepatitis B infection</li>
</ul>



<p>People who have not completed the vaccine series should contact their primary care provider to discuss the vaccine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Avoid hepatitis B infection</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The hepatitis B vaccine is the best way to prevent getting the virus. Other ways to reduce infection risk include:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ask about the hepatitis B status of any sexual partner.</strong><br>Use a new latex or polyurethane condom if the partner's health status is unknown. Condoms reduce the risk of contracting hepatitis B, but don't eliminate the risk.</li>



<li><strong>Don't use illegal drugs and never share needles.</strong></li>



<li><strong>Be cautious about body piercing and tattooing.</strong><br>Ask how the equipment is cleaned, and ensure sterile needles are used.</li>



<li><strong>Ask about the hepatitis B vaccine before traveling.</strong><br>When visiting a region with high rates of hepatitis B,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/9-reasons-to-see-a-travel-medicine-specialist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talk to a travel medicine specialist</a>&nbsp;about the vaccine at least six months before traveling.</li>

<p>They're the wounds in an annual battle with dry winter air.</p>



<p>"When the temperature drops, the humidity tends to drop with it," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/davis-dawn-marie-r-m-d/bio-20054974?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Dawn Davis</a>, a Mayo Clinic dermatologist. "And, so, naturally your skin dehydrates."</p>



<p>Dr. Davis says hands are especially vulnerable to cracks and cuts that can put you at risk for infection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/12/a-persons-fingers-with-dry-cracked-skin-16x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="a persons fingers with dry cracked skin from winter
" class="wp-image-109201" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/12/a-persons-fingers-with-dry-cracked-skin-16x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/12/a-persons-fingers-with-dry-cracked-skin-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/12/a-persons-fingers-with-dry-cracked-skin-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>"So the use of winter clothing is very helpful to help slow or delay or prevent evaporation off the skin surface," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>If that's not enough, Dr. Davis suggests one of three categories of moisturizers: ointments, which contain oil; creams, which have oil and water; and lotions, which are generally water-based.</p>



<p>"If your skin is extremely raw, you may want to start with ointments," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>Once skin improves, rubbing in a hypoallergenic, fragrance-free cream or lotion, may provide enough moisture to prevent further problems.</p>



<p>"And, remember, these products only last for a few hours at maximum," says Dr. Davis. "So you really need to hydrate and moisturize at minimum two to three times daily."</p>

<p>You probably know that tea and coffee contain caffeine, but did you know it also can be found in other drinks, food and some medications? When it comes to caffeine consumption, you're not alone if you depend on it to help you concentrate or be alert. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24189158/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Studies have shown that about 90% of U.S. adults consume a form of caffeine every day</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How much caffeine is too much?</h2>



<p>Caffeine content in beverages widely varies. For most adults, consuming up to 400 milligrams of caffeine daily does not have adverse side effects. Depending on the type of beverage, that can be roughly four cups of brewed coffee, 10 cans of cola or two energy shot drinks.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">While consuming some caffeine is OK, too much can cause side effects, including:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fast heartbeat</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/causes/sym-20050800?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Headaches</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/in-depth/high-blood-pressure/art-20045868?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High blood pressure</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insomnia</a></li>



<li>Muscle tremors</li>
</ul>



<p>Adolescents and young adults must be cautious when drinking caffeine, and children should avoid it altogether. People who are sensitive to caffeine's effects or take certain medications should avoid consuming too much caffeine. People who are pregnant,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-prepare-before-starting-a-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">want to become pregnant</a>&nbsp;or are breastfeeding should talk with their healthcare team about caffeine consumption.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Common caffeine sources</h2>



<p>If you reach for different types of beverages throughout the day, you may be drinking more caffeine than you realize. With a cup of coffee or tea with breakfast, a soda in the afternoon and a piece of chocolate after supper, caffeine is part of your daily eating habits.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the most common sources of caffeine are:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Chocolate</li>



<li>Coffee</li>



<li>Medication</li>



<li>Soda</li>



<li>Tea</li>
</ul>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/-/media/national-files/documents/hometown-health/2019/hidden-sources-of-caffeine.pdf?sc_lang=en&amp;hash=7499569789B650E5E3902F68FAB5CDF5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Caffeine also can hide</a>&nbsp;under some names that are less recognizable.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/rethink-your-energy-drink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Energy drinks</a>&nbsp;have additives that contain caffeine to enhance the effects of the drink. Knowing about these additives can help you avoid consuming more caffeine than you thought, so be sure to check labels before you buy.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some common additives that contain caffeine include:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cartinine</li>



<li>Choline</li>



<li>Ginseng</li>



<li>Glucuronolactone</li>



<li>Guarana</li>



<li>Inosol</li>



<li>Kola nut</li>



<li>Malic acid</li>



<li>Maltodextrin</li>



<li>Niacin</li>



<li>Pantothenic acid</li>



<li>Taurine</li>



<li>Theanine</li>



<li>Tyrosine</li>



<li>Yerba mate</li>
</ul>



<p>Caffeine in powder or liquid form can be particularly dangerous. The Food and Drug Administration has warned that high levels of caffeine can cause serious health problems. One teaspoon of powdered caffeine is the same as drinking 28 cups of coffee, which is significantly more than the recommended level.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Kicking a caffeine habit</h2>



<p>If caffeine becomes more of a hindrance than a help, you may want to consider cutting back. This can be challenging because an abrupt decrease can cause withdrawal symptoms like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/6-tips-for-headache-relief" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headaches</a>, fatigue and difficulty focusing.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">To lessen caffeine withdrawal symptoms, try these tips:</h3>



<ul>
<li>Be aware of and track how much caffeine you consume throughout the day.</li>



<li>Cut back gradually so your body gets used to lower levels of caffeine.</li>



<li>Check products you use for caffeine, such as over-the-counter pain relievers.</li>



<li>Shorten the brew time of tea to cut down on the caffeine content, or choose an herbal tea that doesn't have caffeine.</li>



<li>Switch to decaffeinated beverages, which have a similar taste but much less caffeine than their full-strength counterparts.</li>
</ul>



<p>Contact your primary care provider for guidance or evaluation if you're struggling with persistent or severe caffeine withdrawal symptoms.</p>

<p>An enlarged prostate, known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/symptoms-causes/syc-20370087">benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)</a>, is a common condition often associated with the natural aging process in men. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cheney-scott-m-m-d/bio-20428818">Dr. Scott Cheney</a>, a Mayo Clinic urologist, says it's a condition where the prostate enlarges over time and restricts the flow of urine.</p>



<p>"I like to tell patients that the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/multimedia/comparing-normal-and-enlarged-prostate-glands/img-20006177">prostate </a>is kind of like an orange with a straw going right through the middle of it. And as we age, the prostate gets larger and larger, and the urethra gets compressed by the tissue of the prostate. This makes it more difficult for the bladder to push urine through the urethra, making it harder to empty the bladder," says Dr. Cheney.</p>

<p>The prostate, situated just below the bladder, surrounds the upper part of the urethra — the tube responsible for draining urine from the bladder. The prostate's primary function is to facilitate the reproductive process and fertilization.</p>



<div style="height:23px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-prostate-and-one-with-benign-prostatic-hypertrophy-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of a normal prostate and one with benign prostatic hypertrophy" class="wp-image-189883" style="width:835px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-prostate-and-one-with-benign-prostatic-hypertrophy-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/a-medical-illustration-of-a-normal-prostate-and-one-with-benign-prostatic-hypertrophy-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<div style="height:20px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Enlargement of the prostate gland can give rise to uncomfortable urinary symptoms, including the obstruction of urine flow from the bladder, causing individuals to strain more to urinate.</p>



<p>Dr. Cheney says prostate enlargement, or BPH, does not mean cancer. "It is truly just enlargement, and the cells in the prostate are not cancerous. Prostate enlargement is much more common than prostate cancer," he says.</p>



<p>An enlarged prostate can cause troublesome symptoms and affect the quality of a person's life.</p>



<p>"It's a big quality of life issue for men," says Dr. Cheney. "I think a lot of men ignore their symptoms for a long time because we don't like to complain or think it is a normal part of aging. But, in reality, it's so common, and there are multiple ways that we can treat prostate enlargement and symptoms associated with it."</p>



<p>Symptoms of an enlarged prostate include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Frequent or urgent need to urinate.</li>



<li>Urinating more often at night.</li>



<li>Trouble starting to urinate.</li>



<li>Weak urine stream, or a stream that stops and starts.</li>



<li>Dribbling at the end of urination.</li>



<li>Not being able to empty the bladder fully.</li>
</ul>



<p>"<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/benign-prostatic-hyperplasia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20370093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a> can be something as simple as taking a well-tolerated medication that helps to open that channel through the prostate that can relieve symptoms, all the way up to surgery where we remove the obstructing tissue of the prostate to leave men with a more wide-open channel and better emptying," he says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Treatment options</h2>



<p>"Here's how I like to think about treatment of prostate enlargement. The first thing that you can do is lifestyle modifications, which takes no medicine and is low risk. You can tell a man to avoid excess fluids, especially before bed. Some men don't realize how much fluid they're drinking. The more fluid you drink, the more often you're going to have to urinate. The types of fluids also matter," Dr. Cheney says. "If a man is drinking a lot of caffeine, a lot of alcohol, especially before bed, that can cause nighttime issues to be worse. Some simple lifestyle tweaks can help men significantly and improve their symptoms."</p>



<p>"The next step in treatment of BPH is to try medications, and there are several different drug classes that we have to treat BPH. But essentially, they work on maximizing the channel through the prostate. They relax the muscle in the prostate to help open that channel or can shrink the prostate. Typically, those medications are not as effective as surgery, but they're also less invasive and less aggressive," he says.</p>



<p>Many types of surgeries and procedures may help with an enlarged prostate.</p>



<p>"If medications are not working well, we may suggest surgical management of an enlarged prostate. Less invasive surgical options include Rezum, UroLift and iTind. More definitive options would be transurethral resection of the prostate or holmium laser enucleation of the prostate," says Dr. Cheney.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Any prostate procedure may result in side effects. Working with your healthcare team to determine the best option is essential.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Seek medical help</h3>



<p>"It's sad to know that men are suffering out there and don't want to complain. They don't want to bring it up. It's embarrassing to admit that there's a problem there. But there are many wonderful, effective solutions to treat prostate enlargement," says Dr. Cheney.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reconsidering penicillin allergies</h3>



<p>Penicillin is one of the most prescribed antibiotics for <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/expert-answers/infectious-disease/faq-20058098?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bacterial infections</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"And the best treatments for things like <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/know-the-signs-of-strep-throat-in-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strep throat</a>, <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/consumer-health-understanding-ear-infection-in-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ear infections</a>, pneumonia are penicillin or another antibiotic in that same family," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>



<p>She says if your medical chart indicates a penicillin allergy, your healthcare team needs to look for other options.</p>



<p>"We know that these other antibiotics are often not as effective as a penicillin. So that means you might not get better," Dr. Rajapakse says.</p>



<p>And they can be harder on your system. She says people often misinterpret side effects of the medication as symptoms of an allergy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Symptoms of a true antibiotic allergy are things like hives,rash, so usually a very itchy kind of raised rash that can develop," she says.</p>



<p>It's estimated 50% of people will outgrow the allergy within five years.</p>



<p>"Even if you did have a reaction in the past, it's important to discuss this with your primary care provider. And if it's been enough years out, you may be eligible for testing and to have that allergy removed from your chart," says Dr. Rajapakse.</p>

<p>"Thyroid, and mainly thyroid hormones, are the gas pedal, if you will, for the body," says Dr. Stan.</p>



<p>"And as we're pushing that gas pedal, metabolism accelerates, our heart rate beats faster, we feel hot, we can't rest, we can't sleep," he says.</p>

<p>"It's a situation of an overactive thyroid that is caused by antibodies that we unfortunately produce that end up really whipping the thyroid into an overactive state," he says.</p>

<p>"I'm quite optimistic, looking at some of the early results of our trials, that there will be major benefits for patients in the coming years," he says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">When to see a doctor</h3>



<p>Graves' disease, the most common cause of hyperthyroidism, is more common among women and in people younger than age 40.</p>



<p>If you experience unintentional weight loss, a rapid heartbeat, unusual sweating, swelling at the base of your neck, or other signs of hyperthyroidism, schedule an appointment with your healthcare professional. Make sure to communicate all observed symptoms, including minor ones, during your appointment.</p>

<p>When your parents told you to put on a coat before you go outside or you'll catch cold, there's a small kernel of truth to that.</p>



<p>"If you're a little bit colder outside, your body's immune system may just drop a little bit because it's spending extra effort to keep you warm. That's not with everybody, but, in some cases, it may predispose you to a cold," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But, he says, the cold weather itself doesn't cause the common cold. However, as winter temps dip down, the chances of spreading a respiratory virus go up because more time is spent indoors with others.</p>



<p>"When it's cold outside, typically people gather around the fireplace or around your home. Therefore, if people are sick, you're more likely to be in close proximity to someone who is ill, thus catch the cold," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says if you do catch a cold or one of the common viruses that cause the common cold, it's important to remember that it's a virus in most cases not a bacterial infection, so antibiotics usually don't help. Staying hydrated, getting plenty of rest and eating healthy are all important.</p>



<p>"In most cases, for most healthy people, we call it supportive management: time, rest, chicken soup and just staying away from others is usually the best medicine," he says.</p>

<p>A<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/urinary-tract-infection/symptoms-causes/syc-20353447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> urinary tract infection</a> (UTI) is common, but it can be serious.</p>



<p>"Simple urinary tract infections can be managed by your primary care provider, but when they become complex leading to other issues or problems, you should seek the care of a specialist," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/humphreys-mitchell-r-m-d/bio-20055033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mitchell Humphreys</a>, a urologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What is a UTI?</strong></h2>



<p>The urinary system helps the body eliminate waste, excess water and salt. It encompasses the kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra. Bacteria can enter any part of the system, causing an infection.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="270" height="360" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/05/a-medical-illustration-of-the-urinary-system-including-kidneys-ureters-bladder-and-urethra-original.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of the urinary system, including kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra" class="wp-image-90856" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/05/a-medical-illustration-of-the-urinary-system-including-kidneys-ureters-bladder-and-urethra-original.jpg 270w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2016/05/a-medical-illustration-of-the-urinary-system-including-kidneys-ureters-bladder-and-urethra-original-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 270px) 100vw, 270px" /></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are UTI symptoms?</strong></h2>



<p>A UTI may cause symptoms but not always. Common symptoms are:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>A strong urge to urinate.</strong> Even after using the toilet, that sensation "to go" may not go away.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>A burning or discomfort sensation while passing urine.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Urinating often, passing small amounts of urine.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Blood in the urine.</strong> Blood in the urine may be red, but it may look pink or brown.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cloudy-looking or strong-smelling urine.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Pelvic pain.</strong> Women, in particular, may feel pain and pressure around the pubic bone.</li>
</ul>



<p>Symptoms also may depend on which part of the urinary tract is affected. If you're feeling back or side pain, that may be from a kidney infection. If pain is in the lower belly, a bladder infection may be the culprit.</p>



<p>Especially in older adults, one effect of a UTI can be <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/delirium/symptoms-causes/syc-20371386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delirium</a>, or feeling increased confusion.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are risk factors for a UTI?</strong></h2>



<p>"Typically, our immune systems are great at combating and preventing UTIs, but there are several situations and certain individuals that may be more prone to UTIs," Dr. Humphreys says.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Female anatomy:</strong> Women have greater risk of UTIs. Because a woman's urethra is shorter than a man's, bacteria can more easily enter the urinary system. Menopause also increases the risk of UTIs in women.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Sexual activity:</strong> UTIs are not sexually transmitted infections, but sexual activity increases the risk for UTIs. Intercourse can cause bacteria to enter the urethra.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Some birth control methods:</strong> Diaphragms and spermicide, for example, increase the risk for UTIs.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Catheter use:</strong> Catheters may be used by people in the hospital or by those who are paralyzed or have other neurological problems that make it difficult to urinate. </li>
</ul>



<p>"A catheter is a foreign body and can serve as a highway to allow bacteria to have access to the bladder," Dr. Humphreys says.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recent urinary procedure: </strong>Urinary surgery or an exam with medical instruments can increase UTI risk.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Other health concerns:</strong> People born with urinary tract problems or those who have kidney stones, prostate issues, or suppressed immune systems are at increased risk of UTIs.</li>
</ul>



<p>With prompt treatment, UTIs rarely cause complications. But without proper treatment, UTIs can be serious. Complications may include permanent kidney damage or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sepsis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351214">sepsis</a>, which can be potentially life-threatening.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are UTI treatments? &nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>UTIs typically are treated with antibiotics. Be sure to take the medication as directed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What helps prevent UTIs?</strong></h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Drink plenty of liquids. </strong>Water consumption dilutes urine, leads to urinating more frequently and flushes bacteria.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Wipe from front back.</strong> After urinating or having a bowel movement, wipe from front to back to help prevent spread of bacteria.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Urinate soon after sex.</strong></li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid potentially irritating products.</strong> Using deodorant sprays or powders in the genital area may irritate the urethra.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Switch birth control.</strong> Consider birth control methods other than a diaphragm or spermicide, for example, which can contribute to bacterial growth.</li>
