<p-->It's officially 2025. A new year offers new beginnings and an opportunity to reset your eating habits after the holidays.&nbsp;<p></p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-make-healthy-holiday-food-choices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrea Delgado,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic dietitian, says it's best to eliminate what you don't need, including those party food leftovers.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/aNno0RNCAnk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: The Mayo Clinic Minute</a></strong></p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls="" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/Mayo-Clinic-Minute-Reset-your-eating-habits-after-the-holiday-CLEAN.mp4"></video></figure>



<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video pkg (1:03) is in the downloads&nbsp;at the end of the post.&nbsp;Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network."&nbsp;Read the&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/12/SCRIPT-MCM-Reset-your-eating-habits-after-the-holiday.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Is your refrigerator holding onto holiday leftovers? It's OK to let them go.</p>



<p>"What we want to do is, if we have any remaining food items or beverages that lingered after the holidays, we want to get rid of them," she says.</p>

<p>Either throw leftovers away or slowly eat them in smaller&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1">por</a><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/healthy-meals/sls-20076445?s=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tions</a>.</p>



<p>"We also want to slowly regress back to our old habits. Start introducing vegetables and fruits with most meals," says Delgado.</p>



<p>And pay attention to your food portion sizes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We don't necessarily have to go on a diet. We don't necessarily have to eliminate all of our foods. We just want to look at the portion sizes and the frequency that we have these foods," she says.</p>



<p>Opt for lean protein, whole grains and fresh produce in your diet, still allowing for an occasional treat.</p>



<p>"With nutrition, there is no all or nothing. We can still enjoy those nice treats, those good desserts, those savory beverages. It's all in how much and how often we are having them," says Delgado.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Reset your eating habits with portion control</h3>



<p>Simplify your portion control by dividing your plate into three sections. This can assist you in making healthier food choices and managing your portions more effectively.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>One-half: fruit and nonstarchy vegetables</li>



<li>One-quarter: whole grains</li>



<li>One-quarter: protein-rich foods, such as legumes, fish or lean meats</li>
</ul>

<p>Pregnancy is a time of significant change for a woman's body. Hormones fluctuate, energy levels shift and new challenges arise. One such challenge that some women face is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-long-term-health-risks-of-gestational-diabetes/">gestational diabetes</a>, a condition where blood sugar levels become elevated during pregnancy.</p>



<p>"In pregnancy, many things are changing in a woman's body. Her hormones are changing, and that's a lot of what leads to the initial nausea and vomiting and fatigue of pregnancy. These same hormonal shifts can also impact glucose control, leading to gestational diabetes in some women," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/allen-summer-v-m-d/bio-20055381">Dr. Summer Allen,</a> a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician who provides prenatal care.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is gestational diabetes?</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gestational-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20355339?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;cauid=100721">Gestational diabetes</a> happens when the body cannot produce enough insulin to regulate blood sugar levels during pregnancy.</p>



<p>"There are some women who will come into pregnancy having diabetes already, some with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-1-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20353011">type 1 diabetes </a>— autoimmune and genetically linked – and others with <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/type-2-diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20351193">type 2 diabetes </a>related to diet, activity and weight," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>While gestational diabetes often resolves after childbirth, it's important to understand its implications. "The important factor with gestational diabetes is after pregnancy, over that patient's lifetime, there is an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes later in life," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is at risk?</h2>



<p>Certain factors can increase the likelihood of developing gestational diabetes, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A family history of diabetes.</li>



<li>Being overweight before pregnancy.</li>



<li>Being over age 25.</li>



<li>A history of polycystic ovary syndrome.</li>



<li>Having had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.</li>
</ul>



<p>Routine prenatal screenings typically identify gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. It's a reason why Dr. Allen says health screenings are important.</p>



<p>"The reason we recommend prenatal care is to screen for some of those conditions and to anticipate things that could lead to a complication for a woman in pregnancy. An example is <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hypertension-in-pregnancy-poses-measurable-risks-for-babies/">high blood pressure.</a> Another may be an impact of glucose or sugar control in their pregnancy, such as diabetes," she explains.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Managing gestational diabetes</h2>



<p>Gestational diabetes can have consequences for both mother and baby if not properly managed. For the baby, it may increase the risk of larger birth weight (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fetal-macrosomia/symptoms-causes/syc-20372579">macrosomia</a>), preterm birth or low blood sugar after delivery. For the mother, there's a higher risk of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/preeclampsia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355745">preeclampsia</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/c-section/about/pac-20393655">cesarean delivery</a> and developing type 2 diabetes later in life.</p>



<p>Managing this condition involves a combination of lifestyle changes and, in some cases, medical intervention. Dr. Allen recommends:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dietary adjustments: Try a balanced diet with fruits, vegetables, vitamins and minerals, and monitor portion sizes to help regulate blood sugar levels.</li>



<li>Monitoring blood sugar levels: Frequent checks help ensure that levels remain within a safe range. Insulin or other medications may sometimes be required to maintain control.</li>



<li>Attending regular prenatal checkups: These visits allow healthcare professionals to monitor both mother and baby for any potential complications.</li>



<li>Staying active: Don't underestimate the power of a walk.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Going for a walk, even 30 minutes most days of the week, which can be broken up into 15-minute chunks or even 10-minute chunks, can make a big difference in decreasing chances of developing diabetes in pregnancy," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>Dr. Allen recommends the Mayo Clinic <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/hlv-20049471">website</a> as a resource to help support a healthy pregnancy.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> My teenager received new headphones for Christmas while my preteen asked for a drum set. It's been a bit noisy around here. How can I protect their developing hearing?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hearing-loss/symptoms-causes/syc-20373072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing loss</a> often is thought of as something that happens to the elderly. But we live, work and play in a noisy environment, and hearing loss affects the lives of people of all ages.</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://hearinghealthfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing Health Foundation</a>&nbsp;reports that nearly 50 million people in the U.S. suffer from hearing loss in at least one ear, including 20% of teens. In younger children, hearing loss may be caused by playing with noisy toys.</p>



<p>Many toys that young children play with can produce levels equal to 90 decibels, which is as loud as or louder than a lawn mower. These levels typically require hearing protection. The volume can turn up as high as 120 decibels, which is as loud as an airplane taking off because kids often play with toys near their faces, ears and mouths.</p>



<p>Your child's ears are delicate, and every home with kids has its share of noisy toys. As a parent, it's a good idea to test toys in the store before buying. Test a toy's volume closer to your face, not at arm's length. Play like a child&nbsp;—&nbsp;hold the toy up by your ear, or crouch to a child's height and play with it on the ground. If a toy sounds too loud to you, it's too loud for your child. You can also research the Noisy Toys List from the&nbsp;<a href="http://sightandhearing.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sight &amp; Hearing Association</a>.</p>



<p>Here is a helpful guide for gifts:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Toys. </strong>Try placing clear tape over the speaker. Some tests have shown this lowers the sound level and may be safer for kids' ears. Every now and then, turn the sound off or down on audible playthings.</li>



<li><strong>Music and headphones. </strong>For children and teens glued to their music player or smart device, parents should stand near their child when they have headphones on and the music is playing. If you can hear the music, it's too loud. Output-limiting headphones are an excellent gift option. In most cases, they automatically limit the output level to about 85 decibels, which is a safe volume for up to eight hours. These headphones may be available at your healthcare provider location and through local and online retailers. Many devices, such as cellphones and tablets, have noise output-limiting settings that can be activated. You also can invest in custom earbuds or noise-canceling headphones that help block background noise, allowing you to decrease the volume.</li>



<li><strong>Instruments. </strong>Did someone receive an instrument for the holidays? These are fun, creative gifts, but there are things to consider so hearing isn't sacrificed to make music<strong>. </strong>For all musicians, but especially drummers, smart hearing healthcare is essential. Older musicians may benefit from musician earplugs that limit sound without compromising musical integrity. Drummers should try practicing with drum pads as much as possible. This will eliminate loud noises while still offering a surface for rehearsing stick strokes. Another approach is to limit practice to intervals. Try practicing, with ear protection, for 30 to 60 minutes, taking a break for the same amount of time to give your ears a rest, then going back to practice.</li>
</ul>



<p>Don't forget about hearing healthcare when you're shopping for gifts not only during the holidays but throughout the year — whenever your children receive toys. Make sure your gifts protect hearing and support healthy ears. — <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/katie-dease-aud" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Katie Dease, Au.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Audiology, Mayo Clinic Health System, </em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/owatonna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Owatonna, Minnesota</em></strong></a></p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="760" height="428" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/Adult-Black-Woman-Smiling-16-x-9.jpg" alt="photograph of middle-aged Black woman in pink shirt, outside, smiling" class="wp-image-366395" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/Adult-Black-Woman-Smiling-16-x-9.jpg 760w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/05/Adult-Black-Woman-Smiling-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 760px) 100vw, 760px"></figure>


<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Is breathing from your belly beneficial? If so, can you explain why and how to do it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;From the day you're born, you know how to breathe correctly. That means letting the diaphragm — the large, thin muscle just below the rib cage — do the work of drawing air into the lungs and letting it out. It's known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing, and it's the most efficient and effective way to breathe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time, almost everyone needs to remember how. Rather than belly breathing, people begin chest breathing. With chest breathing, the muscles between the ribs and the neck do the harder work of raising and lowering the rib cage to pull air into the lungs and push it out. Chest breathing requires a lot of effort and moves less air.</p>



<p>When it comes to the correct way to breathe, it doesn't matter whether you breathe through your nose or your mouth. Where you breathe from matters — your belly and not your chest.</p>



<p>Relaxed breathing should originate primarily from the diaphragm with little movement of the chest and shoulders. Chest breathing activates "accessory respiratory muscles" that tighten the neck, chest and vocal cords and can trigger a fight-or-flight stress reflex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A chest-breathing pattern is useful in short bursts when running from danger. However, prolonged chest breathing can contribute to coughing, hoarseness, tension headaches, chest tightness, shortness of breath and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belly breathing promotes a sense of calm relaxation. That's why it's typically part of mindfulness practices and yoga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 80% of people with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-are-you-coughing-so-much">chronic cough</a>&nbsp;have more than one factor contributing to symptoms. These can include postnasal drip,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940">gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a>,&nbsp;asthma, respiratory infections, throat dryness and inefficient chest breathing, which is an often-overlooked cough trigger.&nbsp;People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20351575">chronic coughs</a>&nbsp;tend to adopt inefficient breathing habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of these conditions can aggravate the other, and the cough may persist unless the person addresses all contributing factors at the same time.</p>



<p>Research has indicated that people with GERD who practice belly breathing after eating reduce how often they experience acid reflux.</p>



<p>People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631">sleep apnea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a>&nbsp;can find some relief with belly breathing, which helps them feel less short of breath and less anxious.</p>



<p>Belly breathing also can slow your heartbeat and lower or stabilize blood pressure.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/pain-rehabilitation-center/sections/overview/ovc-20481691">Pain Rehabilitation Centers</a>&nbsp;in Minnesota, Florida and Arizona help people experiencing chronic pain find ways to alleviate or control the pain. One way is by using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664">biofeedback</a>&nbsp;to train patients to relax and breathe with their belly, not their chest.</p>



<p>Medications can't correct chest breathing. The only solution is practice and patience. Most people can improve their breathing patterns with enough time and attention. As a bonus, you may end up with fewer headaches and less anxiety.</p>



<p>To determine how you breathe, try this simple test:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stand up straight or lie flat on a bed or the floor.</li>



<li>Put one hand flat on your chest, the other one flat on your belly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Watch your hands when you inhale and exhale. If you're chest breathing, the hand on your chest will go up and down.&nbsp;If you're belly breathing, the hand on your belly will go up and down.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other signs that&nbsp;<a>you're</a>&nbsp;chest breathing include frequent sighing and yawning, which indicate you're not getting enough air into your lungs.</p>



<p>Relearning how to belly breathe takes practice. If you've ever taken a yoga class or done a mindfulness exercise, those activities usually start with belly-breathing practice.</p>



<p>Begin your training by repeating the test throughout the day while lying down, standing or sitting with your back straight. As you get more comfortable breathing from your belly, you can try it when you're more active, such as walking. Then, build your way up to practicing belly breathing while engaging in more vigorous activities such as working out, running, mowing the grass or dancing.</p>



<p>Don't worry if you revert to chest breathing. Think about it this way: Chest breathing will get you there, just like crawling does. But neither is very efficient. As a toddler, you spend countless hours, with plenty of falls and tumbles, learning how to walk so you can get from point A to point B most efficiently. Like walking, belly breathing will become normal to you. Be patient with yourself.</p>



<p>Not only is diaphragmatic or belly breathing efficient and powerful, but it's also free and has no side effects. Embrace belly breathing, and your body and mind will thank you. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/richard-crockett-md"><strong><em>Richard Crockett, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Immunology &amp; Allergy Services, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato"><strong><em>Mankato</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/new-prague"><strong><em>New Prague</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Minnesota.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>You are pregnant. Now what?</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try to enjoy it, says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>"I start with that because it truly is an experience each time someone has a pregnancy," she says.</p>



<p>And then find a healthcare professional you trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Many of the initial things that someone experiences in pregnancy can be managed and cared for by their primary care clinician, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/morning-sickness/symptoms-causes/syc-20375254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea</a>&nbsp;and vomiting or giving them support with fatigue," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>Prenatal care helps screen potential complications.</p>

<p>An example is high blood pressure. Another may be an impact on glucose or sugar control in their pregnancy, such as diabetes," she says.</p>



<p>Strategies to stay healthy include taking a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-vitamins/art-20046945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prenatal vitamin</a>&nbsp;to balance what you might not be getting in your diet. And stay active. Walking can help. "Even 30 minutes most days of the week, which can be broken up into 15-minute chunks or even 10-minute chunks, can make a big difference on decreasing chances of developing diabetes in pregnancy," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>She says the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/hlv-20049471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic&nbsp;website</a>&nbsp;has additional resources,&nbsp;including a week-by-week guide on what to expect during pregnancy.</p>

<p>Want to keep the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common cold</a> away this winter?&nbsp; Just drink more orange juice packed with vitamin C, right?</p>



<p>"We know that vitamin C does help your immune system function well. It helps with wound healing, helps with even collagen and joint protection, and even some tendon protection," says Dr. Bracamonte. "Overall, though, vitamin C taken in extra doses to prevent common colds hasn't proven true."</p>



<p>While it doesn't prevent you from getting a cold, Dr. Bracamonte says there is some limited research that additional vitamin C might speed up the recovery process slightly in some people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"So if you were going to have a common cold that lasts about seven days, it may cut it down about 13 hours," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says you should be getting an adequate amount of vitamin C if you're including fruits and vegetables in your diet. But if you want to pump up the vitamin C even more, you could try a daily supplement.</p>



<p>"Most cases, it's 500 milligrams of vitamin C. Too much of anything is not necessarily a good thing. You just want to be mindful of how much you're taking, and you're not exceeding the recommendations of the daily allowance," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says it's best to talk with your healthcare team before taking any new supplements.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/10-mayo-clinic-research-advances-in-2024-spanning-stem-cell-therapy-in-space-to-growing-mini-organs/">10 Mayo Clinic research advances in 2024, spanning stem cell therapy in space to growing mini-organs</a></h2>



<p>At Mayo Clinic, researchers published more than 10,000 scientific papers in 2024 that are driving medical discoveries, leading to new cures for the future.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/norovirus-what-to-know-and-how-to-avoid-it/">Norovirus: What to know and how to avoid it</a></h2>



<p>If you've been bit by a stomach bug lately, you're not alone. Noroviruses are usually more widespread in the fall and winter, but you can get sick from the virus any time of the year.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/advances-in-pancreatic-cancer-screening/">Advances in pancreatic cancer screening</a></h2>



<p>Pancreatic cancer screening has advanced significantly in recent years. There are now research-based guidelines on screening for people at high risk of developing the disease, and researchers are collaborating to develop new screening approaches involving genetic testing and artificial intelligence.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/what-to-do-if-you-get-a-respiratory-infection-a-mayo-clinic-physician-offers-tips/">What to do if you get a respiratory infection: A Mayo Clinic physician offers tips</a></h2>



<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, respiratory infections such as colds, flu and RSV are rising across the U.S. When you get sick, it’s helpful to understand how to manage your symptoms effectively, especially if you’re at higher risk for complications.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-tonsil-cancer-what-is-it-and-how-do-you-prevent-it/">Mayo Clinic Q and A: Tonsil cancer: What is it and how do you prevent it?</a></h2>



<p>Tonsil cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Cancers that arise in the tonsils or the back of the tongue are classified as oropharyngeal cancer, and most of these (approximately 70%) are caused by HPV.⁠ When someone is diagnosed with a type of head and neck cancer, testing is done to see if the cancer has spread into lymph nodes or other parts of the body. That helps determine treatment options. ⁠</p>

<p>"Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid is making inadequate amounts of thyroid hormone," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>If you have an underactive thyroid gland, the symptoms may not be noticeable early on, but they can include fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, muscle pain, and swelling in the hands and feet.</p>



<p>"You just have one of these symptoms, the chances of hypothyroidism is going to be less than when you have a conglomeration of these symptoms all developing — that can be a big deal," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>Over time, if hypothyroidism isn't treated, the symptoms can become worse and lead to other health issues, like high cholesterol and heart problems.</p>



<p>"The symptoms of hypothyroidism overlap with many other general medical issues. So it's important, if you suspect yourself of having hypothyroidism, to go see your doctor and have some appropriate thyroid blood testing done," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>Often, treatment is simply taking daily oral thyroid medication to return hormone levels to a typical range. And treatment likely will be lifelong.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,&nbsp;respiratory infections&nbsp;like colds, flu and RSV are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html">rising</a>&nbsp;across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you get sick, it’s helpful to understand how to manage your symptoms effectively, especially if you’re at higher risk for complications.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ardon-tina-m-d/bio-20055713">Dr. Tina Ardon</a>, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic, offers tips for managing common viral illnesses and when to seek medical care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recognizing symptoms</h2>



<p>Flu symptoms include sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, fever, body aches and fatigue. These symptoms may overlap with other illnesses, like the common cold, but key differences exist. Colds generally develop gradually, while flu symptoms typically appear suddenly within two or three days of exposure to the virus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Managing your symptoms</h2>



<p>Start using over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers or cough suppressants to alleviate your symptoms. Staying hydrated is essential; drink plenty of water, broth or warm tea to nourish your body. Using a humidifier or taking a steamy shower can help ease congestion and make breathing easier.</p>



<p>Your body needs time to heal, so rest is crucial. "If you can, I highly recommend you stay home from school and work so your immune system can recover," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Try the following to help manage symptoms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stay hydrated: Drink water, juice, or warm lemon water with honey to ease congestion and prevent dehydration. Avoid alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated drinks.</li>



<li>Use warm liquids: Sip chicken soup, tea or warm apple juice to help with congestion.</li>



<li>Try honey:&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-can-honey-help-with-coughs/">Honey</a>&nbsp;can soothe coughs in adults and children over 1 year old. Add it to warm tea or lemon water.</li>



<li>Rest: Let your body recover with plenty of rest.</li>



<li>Add moisture: Use a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer to relieve stuffiness. Clean and refill daily.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Planning ahead&nbsp;</h2>



<p>For people at higher risk of flu complications—such as older adults or those who are pregnant or have chronic conditions or weakened immune systems—consider discussing a care plan with your doctor before getting sick. “If you’re at higher risk, we may recommend closer monitoring or additional care,” says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>High-risk patients diagnosed with the flu might be prescribed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351725">antiviral medications</a>. These prescription drugs, available as pills, liquids, inhaled powders, or intravenous solutions, target the flu virus directly and require a medical prescription.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that flu antivirals differ from antibiotics, which treat bacterial infections, and antiviral treatments for other illnesses like COVID-19. Flu-specific antivirals won’t work for COVID-19 and vice versa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical attention</h2>



<p>While most respiratory illnesses resolve on their own, you should seek&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/expert-answers/flu-symptoms/faq-20057983">medical care</a>&nbsp;if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Trouble breathing</li>



<li>Chest pain</li>



<li>Dizziness or confusion</li>



<li>Severe dehydration or weakness</li>
</ul>



<p>For children, also watch for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fast breathing or blue lips</li>



<li>No tears when crying or no urination</li>



<li>Symptoms that improve but then return or worsen</li>
</ul>



<p>Dr. Ardon says recovering from a respiratory virus can be managed at home for most people. "Knowing when to get help can make all the difference," she says.</p>
