<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> I'm reaching out because I'm in a tough spot. A close friend rode out Hurricane Ian in Florida last year and it seems to me that he's struggling now. He's angry and jumpy, while being numb to what's happening around him. He told me that he's not sleeping well, especially when another hurricane is in the news. Is it possible that he has PTSD from the hurricane? I'm not sure how to offer support without making him feel uncomfortable.</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20355967">Post-traumatic stress disorder</a>, also called PTSD, doesn't just happen to characters on the screen. It's a normal, natural response to trauma and happens when the nervous system, which is designed to protect you from danger, gets stuck in the fight-or-flight response.</p>



<p>People may develop PTSD when they experience, see or learn about a shocking experience or event involving harm, threatened death or serious injury. Natural disasters, like experiencing the power and devastation of Hurricane Ian, can trigger PTSD.</p>



<p>In addition to natural disasters, other common events that cause PTSD symptoms include accidents, being threatened with a weapon, combat exposure, abuse or receiving a life-threatening medical diagnosis.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PTSD symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Some people experience distressing symptoms for a short period after a traumatic event but get better with time and self-care. For others, the symptoms worsen over time and begin to interfere with daily activities and relationships.</p>



<p>Overall, PTSD symptoms usually are grouped into four categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Intrusive thoughts</strong><br>Recurrent and unwanted memories of the traumatic event can cause significant emotional distress or physical reactions. The person may experience nightmares or flashbacks, which is reliving the traumatic event again.</li>



<li><strong>Avoidance</strong><br>People with PTSD may avoid talking about the event or steer clear of places, activities or people that remind them of the event.</li>



<li><strong>Mood and thought disturbances<br></strong>This category of PTSD symptoms can mirror <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007">depression</a>, with people experiencing hopelessness, negative thoughts about themselves or others, detachment from loved ones, lack of interest in activities, emotional numbness and relationship difficulties.</li>



<li><strong>Reactivity</strong><br>These symptoms may include being easily startled, always on guard for danger and overwhelming feelings of guilt or shame. The person may be irritable or have angry outbursts. They could have trouble sleeping or concentrating and engage in self-destructive behaviors such as drinking too much or taking illicit drugs.</li>
</ul>



<p>It's important to note that some people may have a few PTSD symptoms but not enough for an official diagnosis of the condition. In these cases, treatment still can be helpful and can guide people toward self-care strategies and coping mechanisms.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>PTSD treatment</strong></h2>



<p>The good news for you and your friend is that PTSD is treatable, and many people manage it well or recover from their symptoms. Some protective factors are especially helpful during recovery, including having positive social support from friends like you.</p>



<p>PTSD treatment involves addressing both the physical and mental aspects of the condition. Treatment plans developed by a healthcare professional are tailored to meet the needs of each person.</p>



<p>Certain treatments calm the nervous system and help people regain control over their physical responses to triggers. These tactics help the person have an automatic physical response to tell their body that a perceived threat isn't accurate. Examples include grounding techniques, breath awareness and body-focused interventions. For example, short and shallow breaths can be signs of the nervous system reacting to a trigger. Through treatment, people can identify this reaction and learn to take slow breaths, which can calm the physical reactions.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cognitive-behavioral-therapy/about/pac-20384610?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">Cognitive processing therapy</a> can help your friend identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs related to the hurricane. Other treatments, such as exposure therapy and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/post-traumatic-stress-disorder/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355973?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721">eye movement desensitization and reprocessing</a> can help as well. Finally, medications may be helpful when used in combination with other treatment options.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Positive support</strong></h2>



<p>I encourage you to discuss your concerns with your friend. Focus on your observations of his behaviors before and after the hurricane. Listen without judgment and don't minimize his feelings. Suggest that he seek professional help to undergo a thorough exam and have his symptoms evaluated.</p>



<p>Finally, I recommend that you learn more about PTSD to get a grasp of what he is going through and why he may react the way he does. Remember that each person's reaction to a traumatic event is valid, and his trauma shouldn't be compared to another's as "better" or "worse."</p>



<p>PTSD isn't a sign of weakness. It's a normal response to traumatic events, like a hurricane in your community. With a combination of interventions and professional help, your friend can learn to manage his symptoms and regain control. <em>— <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/jackie-richter-lpc"><strong>Jackie Richter</strong></a></em><strong><em>, Psychiatry &amp; Psychology, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><em><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse"><strong>La Crosse, Wisconsin</strong></a></em></p>

<p>"In general, we look at lifestyle to start off with," Dr. Al-Araji says. "Are exercise and diet healthy and balanced? Are there any factors that might reduce the ability to conceive, such as smoking and alcohol consumption?"</p>



<p>Overly strenuous exercise or being underweight or overweight can decrease fertility. When it comes to diet, eating healthy, varied foods in the right amounts to achieve <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/basics/nutrition-basics/hlv-20049477?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nutrition</a> and a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/mayo-clinic-healthy-weight-pyramid/img-20008111?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">healthy weight</a> is best.</p>

<p>"Look at the portion size. I think that is the most important," Dr. Al-Araji says. "In general, try to avoid processed food and rich, fatty food, and incorporate <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/beans-and-legumes/sls-20076082#:~:text=Beans%2C%20peas%20and%20lentils%20are,has%20more%20fat%20and%20cholesterol.?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulses</a>, greens, vegetables and fruit."</p>



<p>If health concerns such as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/celiac-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20352220?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coeliac disease</a> mean limiting or avoiding certain foods, that should be taken into account in dietary planning, she adds.</p>



<p>Reducing stress levels, getting enough sleep and avoiding excessive caffeine are also important to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/getting-pregnant/basics/fertility/hlv-20049462?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fertility</a>, Dr. Al-Araji adds.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a>&nbsp;is an infection that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/multimedia/pneumonia-and-your-lungs/img-20008863?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflames the air sacs</a>&nbsp;in one or both&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/multimedia/chest-x-ray-showing-pneumonia/img-20005827?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lungs</a>. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus, causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing.</p>



<p>Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people over 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems. For some older adults and people with heart failure or chronic lung problems, pneumonia can quickly become a life-threatening condition.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>The signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, your age and your overall health. Mild signs and symptoms often are similar to those of a cold or flu, but they last longer.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of pneumonia may include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Chest pain when you breathe or cough.</li>



<li>Confusion or changes in mental awareness in adults 65 and older.</li>



<li>Cough, which may produce phlegm.</li>



<li>Fatigue.</li>



<li>Fever, sweating and shaking chills.</li>



<li>Lower than normal body temperature in adults older than 65 and people with weak immune systems.</li>



<li>Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</li>



<li>Shortness of breath.</li>
</ul>



<p>Newborns and infants may not show any sign of the infection. Or they may vomit, have a fever and cough, appear restless or tired and without energy, or have difficulty breathing and eating.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20354210?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Seek medical attention</a> if you have difficulty breathing, chest pain, persistent fever of 102 F or higher, or persistent cough, especially if you're coughing up pus.</p>



<p>It's especially important that people in these high-risk groups see a healthcare professional:</p>



<ul>
<li>Adults older than 65.</li>



<li>Children younger than 2 with signs and symptoms.</li>



<li>People with an underlying health condition or weakened immune system.</li>



<li>People receiving chemotherapy or taking medication that suppresses the immune system.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Prevention</strong></h2>



<p>To help prevent pneumonia:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Get vaccinated.</strong><br>Vaccines are available to prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/vaccines/art-20046750?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some types of pneumonia and the flu</a>. Talk with your healthcare team about getting these shots. The vaccination guidelines have changed over time so make sure to review your vaccination status with your healthcare professional even if you recall previously receiving a pneumonia vaccine.</li>



<li><strong>Make sure children get vaccinated.</strong><br>Healthcare professionals recommend a different pneumonia vaccine for children younger than 2 and for children 2 to 5 years old who are at particular risk of pneumococcal disease. Children who attend a group child care center also should get the vaccine. Healthcare professionals also recommend flu shots for children older than 6 months.</li>



<li><strong>Practice good hygiene.</strong><br>To protect yourself against respiratory infections that sometimes lead to pneumonia, wash your hands regularly or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.</li>



<li><strong>Don't smoke.</strong><br>Smoking damages your lungs' natural defenses against respiratory infections.</li>



<li><strong>Keep your immune system strong.</strong><br>Get enough sleep, exercise regularly and eat a healthy diet.</li>

<p>She says understanding potential triggers for atopic dermatitis is a start.</p>

<p>Triggers for atopic dermatitis or eczema can be internal and external. </p>



<p>"Any sort of stressor to the mind, to the nerves, to the skin or to the immune system can cause a flare of eczema," says Dr. Davis.</p>



<p>It could be daily stress, a food allergy or the jewelry you are wearing.</p>



<p>"Some people with eczema are sensitive to nickel, they may be sensitive to a preservative and a medication that they're using," she says.</p>

<p>Learning how to decrease your sensitivity or stress can help.</p>



<p>Dr. Davis encourages patients to:&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
<li>Practice mind-body exercises.</li>



<li>Get plenty of rest.</li>



<li>Stay hydrated.</li>



<li>Avoid smoking.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Practice a sensitive skincare routine.</li>
</ul>



<p>This includes daily baths or showers with mild soaps, and frequent moisturizing with a fragrance-free, dye-free and chemical-free lotion.</p>



<p>"They may need may need prescription medicines. Those can be available topically by a cream or an ointment or systemically by a pill or a shot. And then we may choose to do advanced therapy beyond that, such as patch testing," Dr. Davis says.</p>

<p>Fibroids are muscular tumors that grow in the walls of the uterus. In most cases, they're benign.</p>



<p>"Even small fibroids, depending on their locations, can cause menstrual irregularities or heavy menstrual periods," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1000" height="562" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9.jpg" alt="a young woman bending over and holding her stomach in pain, maybe abdominal or menstrual cramps" class="wp-image-191970" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9.jpg 1000w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_584151868_Fotor-16x9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" /></figure>



<p>She says a newer, minimally invasive treatment called radiofrequency ablation effectively removes fibroids.</p>



<p>"This technology is really good for fibroids within the wall of the uterus because those traditionally would have required us to make an incision in the uterine tissue in order to remove and treat the fibroid," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<p>Doctors insert a needlelike device into the fibroid, sending radiofrequency heat waves to target fibroids.</p>



<p>"Using energy to break down the fibroid tissue, and that causes the fibroids to shrink and become less productive of symptoms," explains Dr. Louie.</p>



<p>Best of all, there's little to no downtime after the procedure.</p>



<p>"This is the fastest recovery time I think we can offer for treating fibroid-related symptoms," says Dr. Louie.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Uterine fibroid symptoms</strong></h3>



<ul>
<li>Pain during sex.</li>



<li>Pelvic pain or pressure.</li>



<li>Heavy or prolonged menstrual periods.</li>



<li>Frequent urination.</li>

</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://www.hospitalsafetygrade.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Leapfrog Group's Hospital Safety Score</a> is updated and published twice a year. The score is based on 15 measures of publicly available hospital safety data, combined with 12 self-reported survey answers to produce a single safety score. A panel of patient safety experts developed the measures for the score.</p>



<p>The Leapfrog Group's survey assesses the status of many hospital practice areas, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Electronic medication ordering.</li>



<li>Staffing of ICUs by critical care medical professionals.</li>



<li>Structures and systems to provide a culture that supports safety.</li>



<li>Practices to monitor and maintain safe nursing workforce levels.</li>



<li>Monitoring proper hand hygiene techniques of staff who interact with patients.</li>



<li>Monitoring the use of barcode scanning of patients and medications when administering medications in the hospital.</li>
</ul>



<p>The Leapfrog Group is one of many groups that recognize Mayo Clinic as a top choice for patients. Mayo Clinic is the only healthcare organization that consistently ranks among the top providers nationwide regardless of the quality measure used.</p>

<p>Every day, people take more than 23,000 breaths that fill their lungs with 2,000 gallons of air. It's an automatic and essential function that most people don't think about — until that breathing becomes difficult.</p>



<p>Marie Hammes knows this feeling well. The 70-year-old West Salem, Wisconsin, resident was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COPD</a>, in 1996. This chronic inflammatory lung disease causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. She handled her condition without extra oxygen until 2008, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pneumonia</a>&nbsp;made breathing harder.</p>



<p>For the next 10 years, Marie used a stationary oxygen concentrator overnight at home and portable oxygen tanks when away from home. In 2018, a health insurance plan change led her to seek a new oxygen supplier. That's when she met Jaclyn Dunnum, a respiratory therapist and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/services-and-treatments/home-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Store</a>&nbsp;assistant manager in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/home-medical-equipment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Supporting patient needs</h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic Store is a convenient supplier of durable medical equipment for patients recovering at home from an illness or accident or managing a chronic health condition like COPD.</p>



<p>Jaclyn explains that getting necessary medical equipment can feel overwhelming and complicated. Usually, the need is triggered by a medical condition that can feel scary and affect daily activities.</p>



<p>"Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks, 'I am going to go get oxygen' or 'I want a bed and a walker,'" she says. "It is our job to make life easier by providing patients some normalcy in needing medical equipment."</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic Store staff accomplish this by educating patients and their families about their options and helping them select the least intrusive, but most beneficial, equipment for daily living needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Helping Marie breathe easier</h2>



<p>After discussing the options with Jaclyn, Marie decided to continue using a stationary concentrator at night and switched to a portable oxygen concentrator for times away from home. She was happy with how the portable concentrator made it easier to navigate when away from home.</p>



<p>"A portable oxygen concentrator is a small device that she can carry in a shoulder bag or backpack that pulls atmospheric air into the unit and creates medical-grade oxygen," says Jaclyn. "This allows Marie to be safe outside her home and keep her blood oxygen levels at the appropriate level."</p>



<p>Marie primarily uses supplemental oxygen while venturing outside and each night during sleep.</p>



<p>"I would never be able to walk through an entire store without the portable. It has made my ability to move where I want to much easier," she says. "It keeps my brain working well too. The portable is so much nicer to take places because I used to run into everything with the tanks."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">No unimportant questions</h2>



<p>The support Marie feels extends beyond the equipment she has received. Over the years, she has learned that she can depend on Jaclyn to answer her questions quickly and compassionately, whether they are big or small.</p>



<p>"I never feel like I ask a stupid question. She takes it in and answers it — no problem."</p>



<p>That's an important part of the job says Jaclyn.</p>



<p>"Durable medical equipment can be hard to navigate if you don't know the questions to ask or who to ask. I would not be doing my job as a healthcare worker if I did not make sure she was safe and getting what she needed to be safe in her home."</p>



<p>Marie is grateful for this personalized attention.</p>



<p>"They have been wonderful with me. Ask any question, and they are more than willing to try to answer it. It truly helps to know that I have them to rely on if or when needed."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Celebrating every milestone</h2>



<p>There's little slowing down for Marie. Recently, she marked her 70th&nbsp;birthday with her typical month-long celebration.</p>



<p>"I think every year is a milestone and worth a party," she laughs. "Age doesn't bother me, and having my oxygen helps me to celebrate."</p>



<p>Her attitude inspires Jaclyn and the Mayo Clinic Store staff.</p>



<p>"Marie is so fun to work with. She's a busy lady, and I'm glad the equipment keeps her that way," says Jaclyn. "She advocates for herself, and our team will always support whatever she needs."</p>

<p>Health experts say you should get your flu shot as soon as it's available in your area. This will give your body time to create defenses against the flu.</p>



<p>"It takes two weeks to get protection against influenza. So, if you're exposed to influenza in that meantime, you may get an infection," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>And you also may spread a virus. Dr. Mattke says the vaccine doesn't completely prevent illness.</p>



<p>"What it does is offer you protection against really serious complications: needing to go to the emergency department, needing to be admitted, going to the ICU or, in some serious situations, death," she says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Two flu shots for some children</h3>



<p>Some children 6 months to age 8 may need two flu shots. It’s important to work with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>"But if it's your infant's first year of being eligible for the influenza vaccine, I would anticipate that they get two vaccines separated by four weeks," Dr. Mattke says.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>

<p>If your child is scared of vaccinations, there is an alternative to the shot for some kids.&nbsp;The flu mist is approved for people ages 2 to 49.</p>



<p>The flu vaccine, she says, can save lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"In children specifically, the influenza vaccine has been shown to reduce the risk of death by over 75%. And so, for my children, I want to do everything I can to try and give them as much protection as possible against influenza," Dr. Mattke says.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Hand hygiene</h3>



<p>In addition to getting vaccinated, it's important to keep your hands clean and avoid contact with sick people to stay healthy and prevent the spread of illnesses. Help children learn the when and how of hand-washing. Encourage them to wash their hands with warm water and soap for at least 20 seconds before meals, after visiting the restroom, and following sneezing or coughing.</p>

<p>Many parts of the U.S. – and the world — will soon "fall back" as daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour. This year, the change takes place in the U.S. at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 5. That means an extra hour of sleep – and earlier sunrises and sunsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How does less sun affect your mood and level of energy?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says sunlight can influence the levels of neurochemicals in the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:00) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Change-in-sunlight-affect-mood-FINAL29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>"People can feel more tired with less light due to the neurochemical or brain hormonal changes that occur with a change of season or less light. A common chemical that regulates that is called serotonin," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But what happens when you have less exposure to the sun and your serotonin levels are off?</p>



<p>"Your mood may be off, your sleep may be off, the way you regulate your mood cycle — whether you're happy or you're feeling a bit down — can be off. And that can have a downstream effect just the way you feel in general," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says there are things you can do to feel better.</p>



<p>"If you can, get sunlight. Get plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-spoilers-tips-for-a-good-nights-rest/">rest.</a>&nbsp;Get exercise, be active. Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet full of fruits and veggies," he says.</p>



<p>And consider a light therapy lamp. They are designed to simulate natural sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In many cases, I do recommend light therapy for people who aren't getting enough sun to help with mood and balance those neurochemicals out. It's one of the treatments for improving moods, particularly during the gloomy season," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help your mood with good sleep</h3>



<p>As the time change date approaches, here are two things you can do to alleviate the sleep disturbance that may come along with it.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Adjust your internal clock gradually</strong><br>In the days leading up to the time change, adjust your sleep and wake times in small increments so your body can transition gradually. Shift your bedtime and wake time in 15- to 30-minute increments.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time outdoors</strong><br>Sunlight affects your body's circadian rhythm, and spending time outdoors can alleviate feelings of fatigue that often accompany time changes.</li>
</ul>

<p>November is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-topics/education-and-awareness/copd-learn-more-breathe-better/copd-awareness-month" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National COPD Awareness Month</a>, which makes this a good time to learn more about living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD.</p>



<p>COPD is a leading cause of disability and death in the U.S., according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/copd/learn-about-copd/how-serious-is-copd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Lung Association</a>. More than 12.5 million people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with COPD, but millions more may have the disease without knowing it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COPD</a>&nbsp;is a chronic inflammatory lung disease caused by long-term exposure to irritating gases or particulate matter, most often from cigarette smoke. People with COPD are at increased risk of developing respiratory infections, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lung-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20374620?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lung cancer</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-hypertension/symptoms-causes/syc-20350697?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pulmonary hypertension</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">depression</a>. Also, if you have a chronic lung disease such as COPD, you may be at greater risk of severe illness and complications from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-who-is-at-risk/art-20483301?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a>.</p>



<p>Factors that can increase your risk of COPD include exposure to tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke; <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asthma/symptoms-causes/syc-20369653?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asthma</a>; occupational exposure to dust and chemicals; exposure to fumes from burning fuel; and genetics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Symptoms</strong></h2>



<p>Symptoms of COPD often don't appear until significant lung damage has occurred, and they usually worsen over time, particularly if cigarette smoke exposure continues.</p>



<p>Signs and symptoms of COPD can include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shortness of breath.</li>



<li>Wheezing.</li>



<li>Chest tightness.</li>



<li>Chronic cough that may produce clear, white, yellow or green mucus.</li>



<li>Frequent respiratory infections.</li>



<li>Lack of energy.</li>



<li>Unintended weight loss.</li>



<li>Swelling in the ankles, feet or legs.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Treatment</strong></h2>



<p>If you've been diagnosed with COPD and you smoke, it is important that you quit. Most cases of COPD in the U.S. are directedly related to long-term cigarette smoking. Stopping smoking can prevent COPD from worsening and reducing your ability to breathe.</p>



<p>Many people with&nbsp;COPD&nbsp;have mild forms of the disease for which little therapy is needed other than quitting smoking. Even for more advanced stages of the disease, effective therapy is available that can control symptoms, slow progression, reduce your risk of complications and exacerbations, and improve your ability to lead an active life.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353685?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for COPD can include medications, lung therapies, in-home noninvasive ventilation therapy, managing exacerbations and surgery.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading" style="font-size:18px"><strong>Coping</strong></h2>



<p>Living with&nbsp;COPD&nbsp;can be a challenge — especially as it becomes harder to catch your breath. You may have to give up some activities you previously enjoyed. Your family and friends may have difficulty adjusting to some of the changes.</p>



<p>It can help to share your fears and feelings with your family, friends and healthcare team. You also may want to consider joining a support group for people with&nbsp;COPD, and you may benefit from counseling or medication if you feel depressed or overwhelmed.</p>



<p>If you have&nbsp;COPD, these strategies can help you feel better and slow the damage to your lungs:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Control your breathing.</strong><br>Talk to your primary healthcare professional or respiratory therapist about techniques for breathing more efficiently throughout the day. Also be sure to discuss breathing positions, energy conservation techniques and relaxation techniques that you can use when you're short of breath.</li>



<li><strong>Clear your airways.</strong><br>With&nbsp;COPD, mucus tends to collect in your air passages and can be difficult to clear. Controlled coughing, drinking plenty of water and using a humidifier may help.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise regularly.</strong><br>It may seem difficult to exercise when you have trouble breathing, but regular exercise can improve your overall strength and endurance and strengthen your respiratory muscles. Discuss with your healthcare team which activities are appropriate for you.</li>



<li><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong><br>A healthy diet can help you maintain your strength. If you're underweight, your healthcare professional may recommend nutritional supplements. If you're overweight, losing weight can significantly help your breathing, especially during times of exertion.</li>



<li><strong>Avoid smoke and air pollution.</strong><br>Besides quitting smoking, avoiding places where others smoke is important. Secondhand smoke may contribute to further lung damage. Other types of air pollution also can irritate your lungs, so check daily air quality forecasts before going out.</li>



<li><strong>See your healthcare team regularly.</strong><br>Stick to your appointment schedule, even if you're feeling fine. It's important to regularly monitor your lung function and let your healthcare team know if you have worsening symptoms or notice signs of infection. Be sure to get your annual flu vaccine in the fall to help prevent infections that can worsen your&nbsp;COPD and ask your healthcare team when you need the pneumococcal vaccine. </li>
