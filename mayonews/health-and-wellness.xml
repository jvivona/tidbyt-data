<p class="has-text-align-center"><em><sub>Throughout her life, retired educator and social butterfly Lynn Maiman struggled to hear. After years of progressive hearing loss, bilateral cochlear implant surgery at Mayo Clinic in Florida restored her hearing and got her back to the busy social life and people she loves.</sub></em></p>



<p>A swim instructor, senior living consultant and retired educator, Lynn Maiman, 65, is a self-described people person. But for most of her busy and active social life, the Jacksonville, Florida, resident struggled to hear what was happening around her.</p>



<p>Like many people who experience hearing loss at a young age, it wasn't always obvious that she was missing something. Maiman explains that she didn’t piece together when her difficulty hearing began until much later in life.</p>



<p>"I remember when I was in high school, I asked my friends how they knew the words to different songs," Lynn says. "They told me they knew from listening to the radio. I didn't know there were lyrics because I could only hear the background music."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding ways to adapt</h2>



<p>Over time, Lynn found ways to cope with her hearing loss. She recalls sitting in the front row of massive lecture halls so that she wouldn't miss information during her college classes. Later, she began creatively filling in the parts of conversations she couldn't hear and, without realizing it, she began reading lips.</p>



<p>A gut check came when, after working for many years in a successful career centered around children, Lynn found she could no longer understand students when they spoke to her. When she was 50 years old, she had her hearing checked for the first time and was prescribed hearing aids.</p>



<p>"I lived with hearing aids for many years," Lynn says. "They really helped, until they just didn't anymore."</p>



<p>In 2019, Lynn learned she was a candidate for bilateral <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/cochlear-implants/about/pac-20385021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cochlear implants</a>. Because she was afraid of the procedure and the possibility of losing what hearing she had left, she put it off. In the years that followed, Lynn began to experience balance and cognitive issues. She used a service dog to help her navigate daily living activities and struggled to maintain her social life.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Ready for the next step</h2>



<p>In 2023, Lynn decided it was time to revisit the possibility of cochlear implants.</p>



<p>"I made an appointment at <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a> to get a second opinion. That second opinion quickly became my first choice for treatment," Lynn says. "My care team made sure I understood all my options, and I felt very comfortable scheduling my surgery. I knew I was making the right decision."</p>



<p>Lynn’s surgeon, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/raymond-mallory-j-m-d/bio-20538468" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Mallory Raymond</a>, an otolaryngologist with specialized training in neurotology at Mayo Clinic in Florida, explains that cochlear implants improve both the clarity and volume of sound, which is different from hearing aids that only provide amplification.</p>



<p>"Our ability to connect with others through communication is at the core of what makes us human," says Dr. Raymond. "Hearing loss can lead to social isolation and cognitive issues. Fortunately, hearing is the one sense that we can restore if it's lost or diminished."</p>



<p>During a simple, outpatient procedure, cochlear implants are placed under the scalp behind the ear. Dr. Raymond says patients typically recover quickly, and the device is activated after a few weeks. An external processor attaches to the outside of the scalp with magnets, and the two components work together to transmit sound.</p>



<p>Once cochlear implants are activated, Dr. Raymond says the process of recovery and auditory rehabilitation begins. With the help of an audiologist, patients learn how to interpret the sounds transmitted by the implant, which are not as complex as what a person hears naturally.</p>



<p>When her first implant was turned on, Lynn says she cried because she didn't recognize what she was hearing as English. But with time and practice, she adapted to the new sounds, and now she can easily understand what she hears.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A life filled with sound</h2>



<p>"Lynn's progress with her implants is impressive, and her quality of life has greatly improved," says Dr. Raymond. "That's something I’m thrilled to have been a part of."</p>



<p>Less than one year after receiving her first cochlear implant, Lynn had her second implant placed and activated in late 2023.</p>



<p>A social butterfly once again, Lynn spends her time traveling, volunteering with service animals,&nbsp;offering swim lessons to children and people with disabilities,&nbsp;as well as playing and teaching mahjong. She is also passionate about her part-time work helping seniors find the services they need to age at home, something that wouldn't be possible without being able to hear or understand speech.</p>



<p>"I only wish I had gotten the implants sooner. The technology is amazing, and I'm able to do things that I couldn't do before," Lynn says. "I can hear birds now, and I haven't heard that for a long time. I went skiing and could hear the woosh of other skiers coming up behind me. It's been amazing."</p>

<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements-vitamin-c/art-20363932" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitamin C</a> supports our immune systems, helps our bodies heal wounds, protects our joints and contributes to <a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-do-collagen-and-biotin-supplements-work/#:~:text=Collagen%20is%20concentrated%20in%20bones,content%20is%20made%20from%20collagen." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collagen</a> formation, the main protein in the body. Vitamin C is an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/multimedia/antioxidants/sls-20076428?s=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">antioxidant</a> that helps protect your cells against what are called <a href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(12)64861-7/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free radicals</a>, which are produced when your body is exposed to potentially cancerous things like cigarette smoke and the sun's rays. Despite all these benefits, there is limited evidence to support the notion that taking extra doses of vitamin C can effectively prevent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common colds</a>.</p>



<p>For most people, taking a daily <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/drugs-supplements/ascorbic-acid-oral-route/description/drg-20068031" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oral supplement</a> of vitamin C via tablets, drink powders or gummies may not be that beneficial because you may be getting it from your diet naturally. Our bodies don't produce vitamin C on their own, but a lot of what we eat contains it. Citrus fruits may come to mind first when we hear vitamin C, but foods such as potatoes, spinach, tomatoes, berries and other brightly colored fruits and vegetables are full of the nutrient. Contrary to popular belief, an orange bell pepper has three times the amount of vitamin C than an orange.</p>



<p>It's important to get your <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/dash-diet/art-20050989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daily intake of fruits and vegetables</a>, but many people in the U.S. do not. A little bit of added vitamin C may actually help those individuals. In most cases, though, if you are able to access and eat an adequate supply of fruits and vegetables in your diet, that will be sufficient.</p>



<p>Some people may think they should double up on vitamin C supplements when feeling ill, but more is not always a good thing. Taking too much vitamin C can cause side effects that may make you feel worse, such as <a href="https://mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nausea, vomiting</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stomach cramps</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/in-depth/gas-and-gas-pains/art-20044739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bloating</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fatigue</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heartburn/symptoms-causes/syc-20373223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heartburn</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/headache/basics/definition/sym-20050800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headaches</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/a-flushing-disorder-a-case-from-the-endocrine-teaching-clinics/mac-20429375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">skin flushing</a> and even <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/kidney-stones/symptoms-causes/syc-20355755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kidney stones</a> in some people. Make sure you do not consume more than the recommended daily dose of 500 milligrams.</p>



<p>High levels of vitamin C can interfere with multiple kinds of medications and results of certain medical tests such as blood or glucose screening. Using vitamin C while taking <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/combination-birth-control-pills/about/pac-20385282" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">oral contraceptives</a> could potentially increase your estrogen levels. For patients undergoing <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/about/pac-20385033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chemotherapy</a>, the use of antioxidants such as vitamin C might lessen the effect of the chemotherapy drugs.</p>



<p>Overall, taking vitamin C in the form of food is the best way to reap its benefits, but taking extra vitamin C, particularly for those with a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-immunodeficiency/symptoms-causes/syc-20376905" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune system</a>, would not be harmful. Some limited research shows that vitamin C may prevent the duration of a virus, such as the common cold. So, if your cold lasts a week, taking vitamin C may reduce it by 13 hours, which isn't all that significant based on a few limited studies. Consult with your healthcare team to decide what's best for you. <em>—</em><strong> </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong><em>Jesse Bracamonte, D.O</em></strong></a><strong><em>., Family Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Phoenix</em></strong></p>

<p>During certain seasons of the year, you may notice changes in your energy level, sleep and interest in activities.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20364651" target="_blank">Seasonal affective disorder</a>, or&nbsp;SAD, is a type of depression that is related to the changes in seasons. Symptoms typically appear in the fall, continue through the winter months and eventually go away in the spring or summer.</p>



<p>Affective disorders are mood disorders that have an impactful change in emotions and affect. Affective disorders significantly affect feelings and responses to emotions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What are the possible causes of SAD?</h2>



<p>While the exact cause is unknown, it may be linked to the reduced amount of sunlight affecting the natural chemicals like serotonin and <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/melatonin-use-in-children" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">melatonin</a> in your body that determine mood and energy levels and regulate sleep.</p>



<p>SAD is not simply a case of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/seasonal-affective-disorder-not-just-the-winter-blues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">winter blues</a>, a condition that is more mild and common. SAD symptoms are severe enough to make it difficult to function in social, work and home environments.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">How does SAD differ from other types of depression?</h2>



<p>SAD has a seasonal pattern, with recurring episodes happening more predictably during certain seasons — most commonly during the winter months. SAD can have a predictable pattern to depression, which is helpful for the management of the disorder.</p>



<p>The criteria for diagnosing SAD are similar to diagnosing major depression, with the seasonal pattern as a key indicator.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who is most at risk for experiencing symptoms of SAD?</h2>



<p>People who live in the northern half of the U.S., where daylight hours are shorter and there is less sunlight, are more at risk for SAD. It's estimated that about 1 in 20 people in the northern half of the U.S. could have symptoms suggestive of SAD.</p>



<p>While a person is not born with SAD, it's believed to run in families. It's more common in women, as are all depressive disorders.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What symptoms indicate seasonal affective disorder?</h2>



<p>On average, SAD will last about five months of the year. Typically, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/seasonal-affective-disorder-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms </a>will develop in October and worsen around the end of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/how-to-manage-daylight-saving-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">daylight saving time</a>, followed by a more drastic decline in November. January and February tend to be the months with the most severe <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/symptoms-causes/syc-20356007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">symptoms of depression</a>.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Symptoms of seasonal affective disorder to watch for include:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Difficulty concentrating</li>



<li>Feeling persistently tired and fatigued, including feeling a loss of energy nearly every day of the affected months</li>



<li>Feelings of worthlessness</li>



<li>Losing interest in things you would typically enjoy, such as hobbies and social activities</li>



<li>Persistently feeling down or sad</li>



<li>Sleep disturbances, which could include hypersomnia (sleeping too much) or <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355167" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insomnia</a> (difficulty falling asleep)</li>



<li>Thoughts of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/suicide-crisis-develop-safety-plan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suicide</a></li>



<li>Weight changes, including weight gain or weight loss</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Are there treatments available for SAD?</h2>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Light therapy</h3>



<p>Bright&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/light-therapy/about/pac-20384604" target="_blank">light therapy</a>&nbsp;is considered an effective treatment for SAD. Research suggests that around half of people who use a bright light therapy box have good results with symptom reduction.</p>



<p>It's essential to meet with a healthcare professional familiar with bright light therapy to determine the type of device needed to be effective, how to correctly set it up and the length of time required in front of a light box.</p>



<p>Generally, the light box should provide an exposure of 10,000 lux of light and emit as little UV light as possible. The typical recommendation is to use the light box within the first hour of waking up in the morning for 20–30 minutes.</p>



<p>Some light boxes emit white light, and others emit blue light. There is no advantage to one color.</p>



<p>Talking with your healthcare team before using a light box is crucial if your skin or eyes are sensitive to light due to a medical condition or medication.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Medications</h3>



<p>An antidepressant prescribed by a healthcare professional can be an effective treatment option.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Physical activity</h3>



<p>Research has shown that exercising for 20 minutes at least three days a week has similar effectiveness to taking an antidepressant. Being active can help with serotonin production and boost your mood. <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/tips-for-cold-weather-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exercising outdoors</a> during daylight hours increases the effectiveness of the activity.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)</h3>



<p>CBT is an effective treatment for SAD and clinical depression. CBT helps people learn how to manage their symptoms of depression or reduce the severity of the symptoms. Talk with your primary care provider about CBT and how to find a provider skilled at delivering CBT for depression or anxiety.</p>



<p>Because SAD is tied to the changing seasons, the onset can be predicted, which sets a person up to better manage their symptoms. If you have SAD, there are preventive measures that you can put in place and steps you can begin taking before major depression develops.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Remember these tips:</h4>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Be physically active.</strong><br>Exercise helps relieve stress and anxiety. It's essential to <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/winter-weather-are-falls-and-slips-avoidable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stay active during winter</a>, even if you are tempted to become less active during colder months.</li>



<li><strong>Get outside.</strong><br>Spend 15 to 20 minutes outside when the sun is out. If the weather allows, take a walk outside during the lunch hour when the sun is at its peak. Sunlight helps adjust your body's internal clock.</li>



<li><strong>Make your environment bright.</strong><br>Open the window blinds and allow sunlight into your home. Sit near a window while at home or work.</li>



<li><strong>Prioritize sleep.</strong>Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, with the goal of getting seven to nine hours of <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/5-ways-to-get-better-sleep">restful sleep</a>. Excessive napping and oversleeping beyond your typical schedule can disrupt your circadian rhythm.</li>



<li><strong>Stay connected to friends and family.</strong><br>Decreased mood can lead to a behavior of staying home and isolating. Engaging with friends, staying in a routine, and getting active at home and outside of the home are essential.</li>



<li><strong>Take care of your body and mind.</strong><br>Eat regular, healthy meals. Avoid drugs and alcohol, which can make depression worse. Manage stress with practices like deep breathing, <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/mindfulness-meditation-improve-your-quality-of-life" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mindfulness and meditation</a>.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you have a history of SAD, talk with your healthcare team about a plan to better manage your mood during the winter months.</p>

<p>Abbie Langton started dancing at age 3. Although she's trained across the spectrum of dance genres — including ballet, tap, hip hop and jazz — lyrical and contemporary are her favorites.</p>



<p>Abbie's passion for performing led her to receive a scholarship for competitive dance at a university in Connecticut. But during her sophomore year, debilitating pain in her arm and neck forced her to hang up her dance shoes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Trouble finding a root cause</h2>



<p>Pain wasn't new to Abbie. When she was in the third grade, she remembers experiencing swelling in her left arm, along with chest pain. Because she was so young, though, she couldn't articulate what she was feeling.</p>



<p>"My doctor ordered a bunch of tests, worried it might be congestive heart failure because of the swelling in my left arm and chest pain," Abbie says. "The test results ended up being inconclusive, so my doctor decided it wasn’t congestive heart failure, which was great news, but we still didn’t know what it was."</p>



<p>Next, the focus turned to lymphedema, a chronic condition caused by a buildup of lymph fluid in the body that causes tissues to swell. Still, because of Abbie's young age, her doctor decided to forego testing to confirm a diagnosis and, instead, gave her a compression sleeve to wear to reduce the swelling.</p>



<p>Yet even with the sleeve, Abbie's pain continued.</p>



<p>"At every physical, I'd tell them that I was still experiencing pain, but they'd brush it off and keep pushing my concerns aside," Abbie recalls.</p>

<p>By the time Abbie got to college, she'd learned to live with — and dance through — the pain. But during her second year of college, when she started experiencing severe pain in the back of her neck in addition to her arm and chest, Abbie's roommate told her she needed to get help.</p>



<p>"My roommate told me, 'This isn't normal. You need to go somewhere,'" Abbie says.</p>



<p>Abbie started with an orthopedic doctor in Connecticut, who sent her to a vascular surgeon, who eventually recommended a doctor in Boston.</p>



<p>"That was the beginning of the downward spiral of medical appointments," Abbie says. "I was getting really frustrated. I felt like my entire life was on hold. I couldn't dance. I couldn't really work. I couldn't sit at a desk for a long period of time. And at 20 years old, that was my entire life — I was a student and a dancer, and I couldn't do either well. My mental health was plummeting."</p>



<p>Abbie heard from the doctor's office in Boston that they couldn't get her in for nine months. Although she lives in Massachusetts and attends school in Connecticut, Abbie started looking into <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>. Her parents had recently bought a vacation home near the Jacksonville campus, and Abbie was at her wit's end.</p>



<p>Everything Abbie read about Mayo Clinic was positive. When she called, she was able to get an appointment quickly — much sooner than the nine months the Boston doctor's office had offered.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Finding help at Mayo Clinic</h2>



<p>Right away, Abbie's experience with Mayo Clinic matched everything she'd read about it.</p>



<p>"It's different from any other medical institution," she says. "For one, they didn't treat me like a hypochondriac. At that point, because I was young and petite and looked healthy, I felt like so many people were looking at me and assuming I just wanted attention, despite me saying over and over again that I had chronic pain."</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/farres-sam-m-d/bio-20055440" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Sam Farres</a>, chief of the Vascular Surgery Division at Mayo Clinic in Florida, and his team, which includes Michael Adalia, nurse practitioner, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/clendenen-steven-r-m-d/bio-20054680" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Steven Clendenen</a>, anesthesiologist, ordered a full-body workup. The first discovery was a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chiari-malformation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chiari malformation</a>, which occurs when the lower part of the brain pushes down into the spinal canal. The second was <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/thoracic-outlet-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20353988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thoracic outlet syndrome</a>, or TOS, a rare disorder that involves compression of the nerves, arteries or veins in the lower neck and upper chest.</p>



<p>Dr. Farres says TOS is hard to diagnose. But it starts with believing what the patient tells you — and then performing a series of tests to rule out everything other than TOS.</p>



<p>Once Dr. Farres and his team had collected enough evidence that pointed to TOS, they started treatment: a nerve block followed by a rib resection (or removal of a rib) and scalenectomy (or removal of the scalene muscle, which passes through the thoracic outlet).</p>



<p>"I really trusted Dr. Farres," Abbie says. "He educated me a lot, taking the time to make me feel comfortable and explain things to me in a language I could understand. And he was the first person to say, 'This is what's wrong, and this is what we’re going to do about it.' He knew how important getting back to living my life was."</p>



<p>Dr. Farres points to TOS as a condition that steals people's passion. "It depletes their life's meaning, their identity," he says. "It can be very life-limiting."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reclaiming her life</h2>



<p>Just two weeks after her surgery, Abbie returned to school. A few months later — because she wasn't able to lift weights or dance yet — she took up long-distance running, participating in 5Ks and other endurance events.</p>



<p>"I needed to do something active," Abbie says, noting that, just recently, at age 21, she was able to start dancing again. "I probably could've started a little bit sooner, but I didn't want to push myself."</p>



<p>Overall, Abbie says she's in a much better place today.</p>



<p>"I either saw or talked with close to 20 doctors in my pursuit of answers to my pain," she says. "I always knew something was wrong. And it was so defeating to hear time after time that it must be in my head. It wasn't until Mayo Clinic that I found answers and help."</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-stroke-treatment/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Stroke treatment</a></h2>



<p>Each year, an estimated 15 million people around the globe experience stroke, according to the World Health Organization, with one-third resulting in death. When the symptoms of stroke present, calling 911 and seeking care immediately is the most crucial step to prevent disability or death.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/the-4-types-of-systemic-therapy-for-breast-cancer/">The 4 types of systemic therapy for breast cancer</a></h2>



<p>Treatment for breast cancer can come in many forms. In addition to surgery to remove cancerous tissue and radiation therapy, breast cancer also is commonly treated with drugs that are taken orally or intravenously, as an infusion into a vein.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-jessies-journey/">Life after liver transplant — 'Fight… because it's worth it'</a></h2>



<p>Stomach pain is something everyone has probably had at some point in their life. But for Jessie Boyd, her stomach pain set in motion a journey that led her to Mayo Clinic and the experts who could perform a lifesaving surgery.⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/research-shows-new-method-helps-doctors-safely-remove-dangerous-heart-infections-without-surgery/#/">Research shows new method helps doctors safely remove dangerous heart infections without surgery</a></h2>



<p>Doctors at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic&nbsp;used a new catheter-based approach to draw out resistant pockets of infection that settle in the heart, known as right-sided&nbsp;infective endocarditis, without surgery. The research is part of a Mayo Clinic-led study across 19 U.S. sites involving patients who were not good candidates for surgery and whose right-sided heart infections had not responded to antibiotics.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-experts-highlight-advances-in-breast-cancer-research-decreasing-the-need-for-chemotherapy-and-reducing-the-intensity-of-radiation-therapy/">Mayo Clinic experts highlight advances in breast cancer research</a></h2>



<p>Lifesaving cancer therapies can cause serious side effects, both immediately and later in life. With breast cancer rates rising among younger people, the need for treatments that provide excellent outcomes with fewer side effects is only increasing.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shraddha's Story</strong></h2>



<p>It was November 2022, just a month shy of her 28th birthday.</p>



<p>Shraddha was wrapping up another day at the medical clinic where she worked as an occupational therapist. Shraddha's job was to help patients regain the ability to perform day-to-day activities following a health challenge like a surgery.</p>



<p>Suddenly that afternoon, Shraddha became the patient who needed help.</p>



<p>"My co-worker looked at me and said, 'Why is your hand all purple and blue?'" Shraddha says. She admits she had been feeling exceptionally tired as of late, but attributed it to a thyroid condition.</p>



<p>Her co-worker checked Shraddha's vital signs and found her blood oxygen level was dangerously low. "I remember her saying, 'If this is right, you wouldn't even be standing.'" A repeat test showed the same result. "The next thing I remember was we were on our way to the hospital," says Shraddha.</p>

<p>At the hospital doctors began looking for the cause of Shraddha's low blood oxygen level.  A series of tests traced Shraddha's condition all the way back to the day she was born.</p>



<p>"When I was born, doctors said I had fatty liver, but they didn't know why so they called it 'undiagnosed,'" says Shraddha. "The doctors thought it wouldn't be a problem because the liver has a tendency to heal itself." It didn't. Shraddha grew up seemingly in perfect health, unaware that her <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/the-silent-liver-disease-experts-warn-is-on-the-rise-among-hispanics-and-children/">liver disease</a> was silently doing damage to her body.</p>

<p>Shraddha was born in Mumbai, India which is often called the "City of Dreams." At a young age, Shraddha had big dreams of her own.  She wanted to pursue a career in the medical field that would allow her to help others. </p>



<p>Every year Shraddha went to the doctor for her routine physical. Each time she was given a clean bill of health. "I used to do blood tests, but everything always looked good," says Shraddha. Still, the question of what caused her congenital liver condition lingered in her mind.</p>



<p>"I didn't have a family history of any liver condition. I've never had alcohol in my life," says Shraddha. "There was always a question mark. I needed to find out why this happened to me."</p>



<p>At 23, Shraddha became the first person in her family to leave India and go to the U.S. to attend college. She studied occupational therapy and got her master's degree at the University of Southern California. After college, Shraddha found her dream job at a medical clinic in California.</p>

<p>All was going well until Shraddha began to noticed she was unusually tired. "When my sister came to visit she noticed I got tired after walking short distances. I went to the doctor and they thought maybe it was my thyroid," recalls Shraddha.</p>



<p>Then came the day her hands turned purple and her blood oxygen level mysteriously dropped. "My co-worker is a nurse so she got the oximeter and checked and it was 78%," says Shraddha. "And I was like, No, that's not possible because I wouldn't be alive." Shraddha's co-worker checked again, looked at the reading and said, "That's it, you have to go to the hospital."</p>



<p>A series of tests at the hospital revealed shocking results. Shraddha's liver condition had silently led to a more serious condition called hepatopulmonary syndrome.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hepatopulmonary syndrome</strong></h2>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/hepatopulmonary-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20373350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hepatopulmonary syndrome</a> is caused when liver disease shunts blood away from the lungs preventing the body from getting the appropriate amount of oxygen. Doctors told Shraddha the only way she would survive is with a liver transplant. However, she says she was told her condition was so severe and the risk so high, that she would likely not survive a transplant.</p>



<p>She was denied the transplant and given less than a year to live.</p>



<p>"I told the doctors 'that just can't be. I can't have just one year with nothing to bring to this world. I have not served my purpose,'" recalls Shraddha. </p>



<p>Refusing to give up, Shraddha turned to Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</p>



<p>"More than 40% of her blood was being shunted away from her lungs. Because of that she had extremely low oxygen levels in her blood," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/aqel-bashar-a-m-d/bio-20055093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bashar Aqel, M.D.</a>, director of the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/sections/expertise-ranking/orc-20203899?customer_id=173-378-9621&amp;mc_id=google&amp;campaign=20718088499&amp;geo=9030070&amp;kw=transplant%20center%20arizona&amp;ad=678670770145&amp;network=g&amp;sitetarget=&amp;adgroup=158054873227&amp;extension=&amp;target=kwd-1284412548384&amp;matchtype=p&amp;device=c&amp;account=1733789621&amp;invsrc=transplant&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI1bPG-JO5iQMVrjYIBR0f-AKlEAAYASAAEgKkU_D_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Transplant Center at Mayo Clinic in Arizona.</a> "Shraddha's case was one of the most severe cases of liver disease and hepatopulmonary syndrome."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving Shraddha</strong></h2>



<p>The liver transplant was Shraddha's only hope for survival. "Without a transplant, this disease was progressive and fatal. We don't like to use this word, but it is a very progressive disease," says Dr. Aqel. "There was no other cure than a liver transplant."</p>



<p>Dr. Aqel and his multidisciplinary team of experts at Mayo Clinic went to work on a strategy to save Shraddha. The team came up with a plan using a combination of some of the latest cutting-edge technologies in medicine. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"<strong>Liver in a box</strong>"</h2>



<p>Transplanting any organ is a race agains the clock. Every second the donor organ is outside the body it begins to break down. Surgeons only have a limited time window to transplant the organ. Due to the complexity of Shraddha's case, Dr. Aqel's team knew they would need extra time. They decided to use one of the latest medical breakthroughs in transplant often referred to as <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-liver-in-a-box-is-saving-lives-with-new-technology/">"liver in a box."</a></p>



<p>Traditionally donor organs are kept cold until transplanted. "Liver in a box" uses a warm organ preservation method. The organ is placed in a container that pumps oxygenated, nutrient-rich blood through the liver simulating conditions in the human body. The innovative perfusion system gives surgeons more time to perform the transplant. </p>



<p>"Having the donor "liver in a box" allowed the donor liver to stay healthy while we performed this complex surgery," says Dr. Aqel.</p>



<p>Currently, this warm perfusion technology is primarily being used for <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/heart-transplant-innovation-new-heart-in-a-box-technology-provides-gift-of-life-to-arizona-man-as-couple-prepares-to-celebrate-50-year-anniversary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heart, lungs and liver transplants</a>.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saving lives with mobile ECMO</strong></h2>



<p>The next challenge was how to keep Shraddha's blood oxygen levels stable after her transplant. Dr. Aqel's team turned to a device called <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/young-patient-with-covid-19-recovering-after-hospital-stay-ecmo-support/">extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or ECMO</a>. The device often is used when the lungs aren't working properly. ECMO helps with the appropriate gas exchange that must occur to keep the body's blood oxygen level safe.</p>



<p>"It helps in getting oxygen into the blood and carbon dioxide out of the blood through the machine," explains <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/sen-ayan-m-d/bio-20055718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ayan Sen, M.D.</a>, medical director of Mayo Clinic's Intensive Care Unit in Arizona. "It helped us while her lungs recovered after her transplant."</p>



<p>The Mayo team also used one of the newest advancements in ECMO where the device is mobile. </p>

<p>"The best part of the mobile ECMO was that we do it in a way where she could actually walk around with the machine so that we could continue with her physical therapy, which is so important for the healing process after such a complex surgery," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Shraddha was in the ICU for nearly two months. With mobile ECMO she walked nearly every day.</p>



<p>Dr. Sen says mobile ECMO has proved to be a game-changer in critical cases like Shraddha's.</p>



<p>"It is technology that has really expanded from what surgeons do when they do heart surgeries and transplants where now we can do this to save lives at any place that is not a complex environment, like the ICU or the operating rooms," explains Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>Mobile ECMO has become a lifesaving medical breakthrough for many patients.</p>

<p>"It has enabled us to raise the bar when it comes to saving people, who, until now, could not have been saved in the absence of this heart-lung machine," says Dr. Sen.</p>



<p>A team of highly specialized experts escorted Shraddha on her daily walks, meticulously monitoring her vital signs. Each step required Shraddha to muster every bit of strength she had.</p>



<p>"From the first day, I thought even if it pains me, if it hurts, even if it feels impossible, I still need to put that step forward to do something better today than yesterday," recalls Shraddha. </p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>'Mayo's mission is now my purpose'</strong></h2>



<p>Almost two years after her harrowing experience, Shraddha is healthy and back at work. She continues her daily walks, only now, at the beach, in solitude, reflecting on how her own experience can make her a better healthcare professional.</p>

<p>Shraddha says words of thanks alone are not enough to convey her gratitude.</p>



<p>"Dr. Aqel and his team achieved something for me that everyone else thought was impossible," says Shraddha. "It was a gift. I will keep the mission of Mayo Clinic in mind when I am serving my patients. My purpose now is to put forward their purpose and help someone else."</p>

<p>Many parts of the U.S. – and the world — will soon "fall back" as daylight saving time ends and clocks fall back one hour. This year, the change takes place in the U.S. at 2 a.m. local time on Sunday, Nov. 3. That means an extra hour of sleep – and earlier sunrises and sunsets. </p>



<p>How does less sun affect your mood and level of energy?&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bracamonte-jesus-jesse-d-d-o/bio-20432246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jesse Bracamonte,</a>&nbsp;a Mayo Clinic family medicine physician, says sunlight can influence the levels of neurochemicals in the brain.</p>

<p>"People can feel more tired with less light due to the neurochemical or brain hormonal changes that occur with a change of season or less light. A common chemical that regulates that is called serotonin," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>But what happens when you have less exposure to the sun and your serotonin levels are off?</p>



<p>"Your mood may be off, your sleep may be off, the way you regulate your mood cycle — whether you're happy or you're feeling a bit down — can be off. And that can have a downstream effect just the way you feel in general," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Bracamonte says there are things you can do to feel better.</p>



<p>"If you can, get sunlight. Get plenty of&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-sleep-spoilers-tips-for-a-good-nights-rest/">rest.</a>&nbsp;Get exercise, be active. Make sure to eat a well-balanced diet full of fruits and veggies," he says.</p>



<p>And consider a light therapy lamp. They are designed to simulate natural sunlight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In many cases, I do recommend light therapy for people who aren't getting enough sun to help with mood and balance those neurochemicals out. It's one of the treatments for improving moods, particularly during the gloomy season," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Help your mood with good sleep</h3>



<p>As the time change date approaches, here are two things you can do to alleviate the sleep disturbance that may come along with it.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Adjust your internal clock gradually</strong><br>In the days leading up to the time change, adjust your sleep and wake times in small increments so your body can transition gradually. Shift your bedtime and wake time in 15- to 30-minute increments.</li>



<li><strong>Spend time outdoors</strong><br>Sunlight affects your body's circadian rhythm, and spending time outdoors can alleviate feelings of fatigue that often accompany time changes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality video (1:07) is in the downloads at the end of this post. Please courtesy: "Mayo Clinic News Network." Read the <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/10/SCRIPT-MCM-Health-literacy-for-kids.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">script</a>.</strong></p>



<p>Developing personal health literacy — which is the ability to find, understand, and use health-related information and services — is something that can begin early in life.</p>



<p>"Mayo Clinic is truly an expert in healthcare. And we have an opportunity to be there talking with children, getting them excited about their health and empowering them to have agency over their own health and the health of their communities," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Dr. Mattke says these types of books provide accessible information on a wide range of health and science-related topics.</p>



<p>"I think there's a lot of health topics that children struggle to understand — anything from immunizations to why they're feeling sick, especially when children have serious and complex diseases," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Understanding their disease can help them feel empowered and knowledgeable about how they can participate in their care. But it's not just kids with serious health conditions that can benefit from this education.</p>



<p>"My children have read all these books and have read them multiple and multiple times. And so, they can help understand these diseases. It's inspiring their passion to learn more about science and learn more about health," says Dr. Mattke.</p>



<p>Which is another goal of promoting health literacy in children.</p>



<p>"We need to get kids interested in STEM — science, engineering, technology and medicine. And these are really important topics. And so, we're bringing these topics to kids to get them interested at an early age and inspire that passion.," says Dr. Mattke.</p>

<p>What began as a creative backyard project changed Laurie Reese's life forever.</p>



<p>An avid gardener, Laurie envisioned turning an unused outhouse on their property into an ideal garden shed. So on a November day in 2007, Laurie's husband, Pete, used their skid loader to move the structure. While Laurie was guiding Pete, she noticed the outhouse was wobbling, so she put her hands out to steady it. That’s when the structure fell over, trapping Laurie beneath it.</p>



<p>Pete was able to lift the outhouse just enough so that Laurie could pull herself most of the way out from under it, and Pete pulled her the rest of the way to safety. Paramedics took Laurie from her home in Oronoco, Minnesota, to&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/minnesota/campus-buildings-maps/mayo-clinic-hospital-saint-marys-campus" target="_blank">Mayo Clinic Hospital, Saint Marys Campus</a>&nbsp;in Rochester, Minnesota.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A sobering prognosis</h2>



<p>Laurie and Pete learned that two vertebrae in her thoracic (middle) spine were damaged. She had a fracture of the T12 vertebrae and a fracture dislocation of the T11 and T12 vertebrae.</p>



<p>The next day, she underwent nearly six hours of surgery. Her prognosis following the operation was dire: Laurie would have a 0-3% chance of walking again.</p>



<p>"I was in shock and not really thinking clearly. So many things were running through my head," Laurie says. "I was just 39 and wondered if this injury would shorten my life. Our daughter was pregnant with our first grandchild, and I thought, 'Well, I've still got use of my arms, so at least I can hold the baby.'"</p>



<p>Thoughts of her future grandchild spurred her to work especially hard in therapy to gain as much strength, movement and ability to do everyday tasks as possible. Laurie also knew two people who had quadriplegia, so she understood the reality of her situation.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Preparing for her new life&nbsp;</h2>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="244" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-walking-in-therapy.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395478" style="aspect-ratio:3/4;object-fit:cover;width:278px;height:auto" /></figure></div>


<p>Laurie began rehabilitation while still in the hospital, then transferred to the Mary Brigh Building on the Saint Marys Campus for intensive, inpatient rehabilitation to adapt to her new life. </p>



<p>In rehab, Laurie worked with physical and occupational therapists to practice and learn a wide range of skills and activities, including:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stretching her legs.</li>



<li>Rolling over and sitting up.</li>



<li>Inserting a catheter.</li>



<li>Using a wheelchair.</li>



<li>Transferring in and out of vehicles.</li>



<li>Showering and dressing.</li>



<li>Using a machine that supported her, braced her legs and simulated walking.</li>



<li>Performing daily chores like cooking, doing the dishes and opening cupboards. </li>
</ul>



<p>"Before they let you leave rehabilitation, you go home for a day," Laurie says. "That's when the reality hits you that this is your life going forward."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Adapting, learning and doing what she wants </h2>



<p>By December 20, Laurie was ready to return home. Once home, outpatient therapy and occupational therapists make suggestions for adapting the house to meet her needs. To accommodate her wheelchair, the Reeses added a ramp to the house and eventually remodeled the kitchen.</p>



<p>Once the basics were manageable, Laurie focused on resuming the things she loved to do, such as gardening, horseback riding and snowmobiling.</p>



<p>Pete made modifications so she could indulge in her love of flowers. He revamped the garden beds to make them smaller and more manageable, built raised beds that Laurie could reach and added a fountain.</p>



<p>Another goal of Laurie's was to try horseback riding again. She was able to sit on her horse a couple of times but realized it wasn't feasible to safely ride.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="660" height="370" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-posed-on-snowmobile.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-395477" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-posed-on-snowmobile.jpg 660w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/reese-posed-on-snowmobile-300x168.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure></div>


<p>Snowmobiling was a different story. After testing her comfort and ability on an older machine, she opted to get a new one with upgrades like an electric start, reverse gear, heated hand warmers and more. With a strap anchoring her legs, she's taken several trips — and even some spills — and continues to tinker with the design of her seat.</p>



<p>Since the accident, Laurie has been determined to live life on her own terms. With help from her therapists and plenty of practice, she stood for pictures at a daughter's wedding.</p>



<p>She holds, cares for and plays with her eight grandchildren. When she wants to see them, she loads her wheelchair onto the lift bed, gets into her pickup and drives to their homes.</p>



<p>Laurie also returned to work in cardiovascular education for Mayo Clinic in Rochester, a position she's held for 19 years. She provides digital education for medical staff needing board certification or recertification.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Nearly 20 years of success</h2>



<p>Although it's been 17 years since her accident, Laurie still battles issues like pressure sores that landed her in the hospital for three months this year. That hospitalization set her back, and she spent nearly three months in rehabilitation at <a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/cannon-falls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Health System in Cannon Falls</a>, Minnesota.</p>



<p>"It still can be rough. Some days are better than others, and I get jealous of those who can easily do something like picking up a baby," she says. "And nothing is as easy as you think it will be, but you make it work. You have to have the mindset and the drive to constantly adapt."</p>



<p>What helped Laurie develop that mindset and drive was a journal her rehab team encouraged her to write in the hospital after her initial injury. The journal evolved into a book, "My Life Beyond the Outhouse: The First Two Years." Laurie focused on the first two years because she was most likely to regain any mobility during that time.</p>



<p>"Publishing the book helped me talk about my injury, and my family and friends got a better understanding of what I was going through," Laurie says. "People who read it say they had no idea how much of your life is affected by being paralyzed."</p>



<p>While her life changed on that November day, it didn't end. Laurie attributes her success to her rehabilitation team and their ongoing care.</p>



<p>"I couldn't have asked for better people on my side. When I cried, they gave me a shoulder to cry on," she says. "I can't imagine not having the training they gave me. Because of them, I was able to start out in a new capacity, and today, I'm able to do almost whatever I want."</p>



<p>"Even now, when I go in for appointments, they remember me and know my story. It's so neat that out of the thousands of patients they've seen, we still have that connection."</p>
