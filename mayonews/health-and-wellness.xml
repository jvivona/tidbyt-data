<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:&nbsp;</strong>Is breathing from your belly beneficial? If so, can you explain why and how to do it?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;From the day you're born, you know how to breathe correctly. That means letting the diaphragm — the large, thin muscle just below the rib cage — do the work of drawing air into the lungs and letting it out. It's known as diaphragmatic or belly breathing, and it's the most efficient and effective way to breathe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But over time, almost everyone needs to remember how. Rather than belly breathing, people begin chest breathing. With chest breathing, the muscles between the ribs and the neck do the harder work of raising and lowering the rib cage to pull air into the lungs and push it out. Chest breathing requires a lot of effort and moves less air.</p>



<p>When it comes to the correct way to breathe, it doesn't matter whether you breathe through your nose or your mouth. Where you breathe from matters — your belly and not your chest.</p>



<p>Relaxed breathing should originate primarily from the diaphragm with little movement of the chest and shoulders. Chest breathing activates "accessory respiratory muscles" that tighten the neck, chest and vocal cords and can trigger a fight-or-flight stress reflex.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A chest-breathing pattern is useful in short bursts when running from danger. However, prolonged chest breathing can contribute to coughing, hoarseness, tension headaches, chest tightness, shortness of breath and anxiety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Belly breathing promotes a sense of calm relaxation. That's why it's typically part of mindfulness practices and yoga.&nbsp;</p>



<p>About 80% of people with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-are-you-coughing-so-much">chronic cough</a>&nbsp;have more than one factor contributing to symptoms. These can include postnasal drip,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gerd/symptoms-causes/syc-20361940">gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)</a>,&nbsp;asthma, respiratory infections, throat dryness and inefficient chest breathing, which is an often-overlooked cough trigger.&nbsp;People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-cough/symptoms-causes/syc-20351575">chronic coughs</a>&nbsp;tend to adopt inefficient breathing habits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each of these conditions can aggravate the other, and the cough may persist unless the person addresses all contributing factors at the same time.</p>



<p>Research has indicated that people with GERD who practice belly breathing after eating reduce how often they experience acid reflux.</p>



<p>People with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sleep-apnea/symptoms-causes/syc-20377631">sleep apnea</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/copd/symptoms-causes/syc-20353679">chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)</a>&nbsp;can find some relief with belly breathing, which helps them feel less short of breath and less anxious.</p>



<p>Belly breathing also can slow your heartbeat and lower or stabilize blood pressure.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic's&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/pain-rehabilitation-center/sections/overview/ovc-20481691">Pain Rehabilitation Centers</a>&nbsp;in Minnesota, Florida and Arizona help people experiencing chronic pain find ways to alleviate or control the pain. One way is by using&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/biofeedback/about/pac-20384664">biofeedback</a>&nbsp;to train patients to relax and breathe with their belly, not their chest.</p>



<p>Medications can't correct chest breathing. The only solution is practice and patience. Most people can improve their breathing patterns with enough time and attention. As a bonus, you may end up with fewer headaches and less anxiety.</p>



<p>To determine how you breathe, try this simple test:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stand up straight or lie flat on a bed or the floor.</li>



<li>Put one hand flat on your chest, the other one flat on your belly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Watch your hands when you inhale and exhale. If you're chest breathing, the hand on your chest will go up and down.&nbsp;If you're belly breathing, the hand on your belly will go up and down.</li>
</ul>



<p>Other signs that&nbsp;<a>you're</a>&nbsp;chest breathing include frequent sighing and yawning, which indicate you're not getting enough air into your lungs.</p>



<p>Relearning how to belly breathe takes practice. If you've ever taken a yoga class or done a mindfulness exercise, those activities usually start with belly-breathing practice.</p>



<p>Begin your training by repeating the test throughout the day while lying down, standing or sitting with your back straight. As you get more comfortable breathing from your belly, you can try it when you're more active, such as walking. Then, build your way up to practicing belly breathing while engaging in more vigorous activities such as working out, running, mowing the grass or dancing.</p>



<p>Don't worry if you revert to chest breathing. Think about it this way: Chest breathing will get you there, just like crawling does. But neither is very efficient. As a toddler, you spend countless hours, with plenty of falls and tumbles, learning how to walk so you can get from point A to point B most efficiently. Like walking, belly breathing will become normal to you. Be patient with yourself.</p>



<p>Not only is diaphragmatic or belly breathing efficient and powerful, but it's also free and has no side effects. Embrace belly breathing, and your body and mind will thank you. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/richard-crockett-md"><strong><em>Richard Crockett, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Immunology &amp; Allergy Services, Mayo Clinic Health System,&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/mankato"><strong><em>Mankato</em></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em></strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/new-prague"><strong><em>New Prague</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Minnesota.</em></strong><strong></strong></p>

<p>You are pregnant. Now what?</p>



<p>Take a deep breath and try to enjoy it, says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>"I start with that because it truly is an experience each time someone has a pregnancy," she says.</p>



<p>And then find a healthcare professional you trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"Many of the initial things that someone experiences in pregnancy can be managed and cared for by their primary care clinician, like the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/morning-sickness/symptoms-causes/syc-20375254">nausea</a>&nbsp;and vomiting or giving them support with fatigue," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>Prenatal care helps screen potential complications.</p>

<p>An example is high blood pressure. Another may be an impact on glucose or sugar control in their pregnancy, such as diabetes," she says.</p>



<p>Strategies to stay healthy include taking a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/prenatal-vitamins/art-20046945">prenatal vitamin</a>&nbsp;to balance what you might not be getting in your diet. And stay active. Walking can help. "Even 30 minutes most days of the week, which can be broken up into 15-minute chunks or even 10-minute chunks, can make a big difference on decreasing chances of developing diabetes in pregnancy," says Dr. Allen.</p>



<p>She says the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/pregnancy-week-by-week/in-depth/hlv-20049471">Mayo Clinic&nbsp;website</a>&nbsp;has additional resources,&nbsp;including a week-by-week guide on what to expect during pregnancy.</p>

<p>"We know that vitamin C does help your immune system function well. It helps with wound healing, helps with even collagen and joint protection, and even some tendon protection," says Dr. Bracamonte. "Overall, though, vitamin C taken in extra doses to prevent common colds hasn't proven true."</p>



<p>While it doesn't prevent you from getting a cold, Dr. Bracamonte says there is some limited research that additional vitamin C might speed up the recovery process slightly in some people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"So if you were going to have a common cold that lasts about seven days, it may cut it down about 13 hours," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says you should be getting an adequate amount of vitamin C if you're including fruits and vegetables in your diet. But if you want to pump up the vitamin C even more, you could try a daily supplement.</p>



<p>"Most cases, it's 500 milligrams of vitamin C. Too much of anything is not necessarily a good thing. You just want to be mindful of how much you're taking, and you're not exceeding the recommendations of the daily allowance," says Dr. Bracamonte.</p>



<p>He says it's best to talk with your healthcare team before taking any new supplements.</p>

<p>"Hypothyroidism is when the thyroid is making inadequate amounts of thyroid hormone," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>If you have an underactive thyroid gland, the symptoms may not be noticeable early on, but they can include fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, constipation, muscle pain, and swelling in the hands and feet.</p>



<p>"You just have one of these symptoms, the chances of hypothyroidism is going to be less than when you have a conglomeration of these symptoms all developing — that can be a big deal," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>Over time, if hypothyroidism isn't treated, the symptoms can become worse and lead to other health issues, like high cholesterol and heart problems.</p>



<p>"The symptoms of hypothyroidism overlap with many other general medical issues. So it's important, if you suspect yourself of having hypothyroidism, to go see your doctor and have some appropriate thyroid blood testing done," says Dr. Bernet.</p>



<p>Often, treatment is simply taking daily oral thyroid medication to return hormone levels to a typical range. And treatment likely will be lifelong.&nbsp;</p>

<p></p>



<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,&nbsp;respiratory infections&nbsp;like colds, flu and RSV are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/data/index.html">rising</a>&nbsp;across the U.S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When you get sick, it’s helpful to understand how to manage your symptoms effectively, especially if you’re at higher risk for complications.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/ardon-tina-m-d/bio-20055713">Dr. Tina Ardon</a>, a family medicine physician at Mayo Clinic, offers tips for managing common viral illnesses and when to seek medical care.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Recognizing symptoms</h2>



<p>Flu symptoms include sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, fever, body aches and fatigue. These symptoms may overlap with other illnesses, like the common cold, but key differences exist. Colds generally develop gradually, while flu symptoms typically appear suddenly within two or three days of exposure to the virus.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Managing your symptoms</h2>



<p>Start using over-the-counter medications such as pain relievers or cough suppressants to alleviate your symptoms. Staying hydrated is essential; drink plenty of water, broth or warm tea to nourish your body. Using a humidifier or taking a steamy shower can help ease congestion and make breathing easier.</p>



<p>Your body needs time to heal, so rest is crucial. "If you can, I highly recommend you stay home from school and work so your immune system can recover," says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>Try the following to help manage symptoms:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Stay hydrated: Drink water, juice, or warm lemon water with honey to ease congestion and prevent dehydration. Avoid alcohol, coffee, and caffeinated drinks.</li>



<li>Use warm liquids: Sip chicken soup, tea or warm apple juice to help with congestion.</li>



<li>Try honey:&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-can-honey-help-with-coughs/">Honey</a>&nbsp;can soothe coughs in adults and children over 1 year old. Add it to warm tea or lemon water.</li>



<li>Rest: Let your body recover with plenty of rest.</li>



<li>Add moisture: Use a cool-mist humidifier or vaporizer to relieve stuffiness. Clean and refill daily.</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Planning ahead&nbsp;</h2>



<p>For people at higher risk of flu complications—such as older adults or those who are pregnant or have chronic conditions or weakened immune systems—consider discussing a care plan with your doctor before getting sick. “If you’re at higher risk, we may recommend closer monitoring or additional care,” says Dr. Ardon.</p>



<p>High-risk patients diagnosed with the flu might be prescribed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20351725">antiviral medications</a>. These prescription drugs, available as pills, liquids, inhaled powders, or intravenous solutions, target the flu virus directly and require a medical prescription.</p>



<p>It’s important to note that flu antivirals differ from antibiotics, which treat bacterial infections, and antiviral treatments for other illnesses like COVID-19. Flu-specific antivirals won’t work for COVID-19 and vice versa.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When to seek medical attention</h2>



<p>While most respiratory illnesses resolve on their own, you should seek&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/expert-answers/flu-symptoms/faq-20057983">medical care</a>&nbsp;if your symptoms worsen or if you experience any of the following:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Trouble breathing</li>



<li>Chest pain</li>



<li>Dizziness or confusion</li>



<li>Severe dehydration or weakness</li>
</ul>



<p>For children, also watch for:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Fast breathing or blue lips</li>



<li>No tears when crying or no urination</li>



<li>Symptoms that improve but then return or worsen</li>
</ul>

<p>Eric Mason Sr. is many things — pastor, bishop, educator, nonprofit director, mentor, husband, father and grandfather — but one of the activities he enjoys most is singing.</p>



<p>Because of his work, Eric, 55, travels a lot — both near his home in Savannah, Georgia, and beyond — preaching to different congregations and, often, leading them in song. He's even recorded three CDs. So when he noticed he couldn’t hold a note and "it felt like my lungs deflated" when he sang, Eric says he knew the weight he'd been gaining had started to affect his health.</p>



<p>Still, it took a devastating loss and hitting rock bottom for him to seek help.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A breakdown</strong></h2>



<p>Eric has a doctorate in theology and a 20-year history as a schoolteacher. He was serving as pastor of a nondenominational church and working on a prisoner reentry program for the Georgia governor's office when his mom became gravely ill.</p>



<p>Already battling diabetes and blindness in one eye, Eric's mom was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. As her only son, Eric wanted to be by her side — driving her to and from appointments and helping her through treatment. But one day, a doctor told them there was nothing else treatment could do for her.</p>



<p>"My mom meant the world to me," Eric says. "And I couldn't do anything but hold her, pray for her and try to comfort her. But it was killing me."</p>



<p>She died a short time later.</p>



<p>Caring for a sick loved one and putting his own health on hold had taken a toll on Eric. Just one month after his mom died, his doctor told him he had developed diabetes, and if he didn't lose weight and change his lifestyle, he could be gone within 10 years too.</p>



<p>Around the same time, Eric also received bad news at work, learning his position within the governor's office was being eliminated due to budget cuts.</p>



<p>"It was a tough period for me," he recalls. "Things got really heavy, and I just broke down. I didn't want to preach. I didn't want to do anything."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397358" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_before-16x9-1.jpg 1224w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eric Mason before surgery</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Eric started going to counseling and trying to lose weight, but it wasn't working. "I was in such a low place," he says. "One day, when I was praying, I realized I needed to get help with my health and weight loss because I couldn't do it by myself."</p>



<p>That's when Eric reached out to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/bariatric-center-florida/sections/overview/ovc-20523458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Center at Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Building a foundation of</strong><strong> </strong><strong>health</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>Located in Jacksonville, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Florida</a>, which houses the Bariatric Center, is just about an hour and 20 minutes from Savannah by car. Because he'd "heard so many good things about Mayo and had some family members who'd gone there and were happy with the service they received," Eric decided the trip was worth it.</p>



<p>Eric met <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/edwards-michael-a-m-d/bio-20456489" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Michael Edwards</a>, a bariatric surgeon, who, along with the bariatric surgery team, determined Eric was a good candidate for a weight-loss procedure. Dr. Edwards detailed Eric's options, including the lifestyle changes he'd need to make in combination with any surgery.</p>



<p>"Most of the time, the behaviors many people come to weight-loss surgery with are the ones they tend to continue," Dr. Edwards says. "So I tell patients that the behavior changes we recommend to support success well after surgery need to start well before their surgery takes place."</p>



<p>Eric chose to have a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sleeve-gastrectomy/about/pac-20385183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleeve gastrectomy</a> — a laparoscopic procedure that removes nearly 80% of the stomach — and got to work preparing for the surgery by following the lifestyle modifications the bariatric surgery team had outlined for him.</p>



<p>"I went hard because I was really serious about getting the weight off," Eric says, noting he went from roughly 350 pounds before he started the weight-loss program to 280 pounds on the day of his surgery six months later.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>From lifestyle changes to lifelong health</strong></h2>



<p>Now, two years post-surgery, Eric still follows the plan to a tee.</p>



<p>"It's a complete mindset change," he says. "I use a plate with sections, so everything is a small portion. I stop eating when my body tells me to stop, and I exercise regularly."</p>



<p>Eric adds that he also watches his calorie and sugar intake, and avoids several foods, including "all the white things," like grits, bread, rice and mashed potatoes. He also doesn’t drink soda. "For the most part, everything I eat is baked chicken, fish or turkey," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="533" height="800" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_after.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-397360" style="width:281px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_after.jpg 533w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/12/Mason_after-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 533px) 100vw, 533px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Eric Mason after surgery</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>What he says he's gotten in return for these changes is the rest of his life.</p>



<p>"I tell people this is the best thing that's ever happened to me," Eric says. "It changed my life completely. I used to have headaches and pain, and had so many things physically going on. Now, everything is about how can I help someone else or be a blessing to them. And it's about fulfilling my bucket list — going places like Las Vegas and Hawaii and walking this time instead of riding around on a scooter. It's like there's nothing I can't do at this point in my life if I put my mind and heart to it."</p>



<p>For their part, Eric says members of his congregation have been very supportive, noting that three have even opted to have weight-loss procedures themselves since his surgery.</p>



<p>His congregation also has been helpful in cutting out unhealthy foods, like fried chicken, which had been a staple at church gatherings.</p>



<p>"They call me the skinny pastor," Eric laughs. "I love putting on and modeling my skinny suits now."</p>



<p>"Eric's done phenomenal since his surgery," Dr. Edwards says. "You can tell he's much healthier and enjoying life, and is much more vibrant and more engaged with his congregation. It's remarkable."</p>



<p>Eric also has a new job in addition to his ministry work — serving as the director of family and community services at Greenbriar Children's Center, a Savannah-based nonprofit organization that serves children and families. But one of the major benefits Eric notices is how his weight loss and lifestyle changes have affected his singing. "My voice is lighter and more controlled now," he says. "And it's easier for me to hold a note. But the biggest thing is that I feel good doing it again."</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/pokemon-party-at-mayo-clinic-childrens-center-brings-joy-lasting-memories/">Pokémon party at Mayo Clinic Children's Center brings joy, lasting memories</a></h2>



<p>In his 5 years, Arthur has lived much of his life in the hospital because of terminal cancer. That's where he met Kevin Pike, a security ambassador at Mayo Clinic, who ignited a passion for Pokémon in Arthur. So much so that Arthur, with Kevin's help and that of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, went on to throw a party for friends at the Mayo Clinic Children's Center.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/an-army-of-support/">An army of support</a></h2>



<p>A heartwarming mission in Rochester, Minnesota, as around 20 active-duty soldiers visited 5-year-old Gabe Downey at Mayo Clinic Children's Center. Gabe, who is battling rhabdomyosarcoma, has been receiving incredible support from soldiers worldwide after his mom shared his journey on social media.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/10-patients-receive-the-ultimate-gift-in-a-single-day-at-mayo-clinic/">10 patients receive the ultimate gift in a single day at Mayo Clinic</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic surgeons recently performed 10 organ transplants within 24 hours, setting a record for both the hospital and the state of Arizona. On Nov. 19, Mayo Clinic teams worked around the clock to complete seven kidney transplants and three liver transplants.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-covid-19-at-home-tests-and-expiration-dates/">Mayo Clinic Minute: COVID-19 at-home tests and expiration dates</a></h2>



<p>Taking a home antigen test for COVID-19 is a simple first step if you feel unwell or were exposed to the virus. But what about those COVID-19 tests you've stored away for the last year? Are they still good? Dr. Matthew Binnicker, director of the Clinical Virology Laboratory at Mayo Clinic, offers some guidance about COVID-19 testing.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/treating-advanced-prostate-cancer/">Treating advanced prostate cancer</a></h2>



<p>While most advanced prostate cancer is incurable, treatments can slow or shrink the cancer, reduce symptoms, and extend a person's life. Recent advancements in diagnostic techniques and new treatments have improved the survival rate for advanced prostate cancer.</p>

<p>"It's worthwhile having that conversation with your primary care team because we might change depending on conditions that you have and potentially even the age at which you would receive that vaccine," says Dr. Presutti.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Adult vaccinations to update</h3>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pneumonia/symptoms-causes/syc-20354204?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pneumonia</a> can be life-threatening when fluid fills the lungs' air sacs. In general, a vaccination is recommended for all adults 65 and older.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/shingles/symptoms-causes/syc-20353054?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shingles</a>, a reactivation of the virus that causes chickenpox, can cause a painful, blistering rash. Vaccination is recommended in adults over 50.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/tetanus/symptoms-causes/syc-20351625?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tetanus</a> is caused by a bacterial infection, often from a cut or wound. The Tdap vaccine is recommended every 10 years and also protects against diphtheria and <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/whooping-cough-pertussis-is-a-highly-contagious-respiratory-tract-infection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pertussis</a> – the latter known as whooping cough.</p>



<p>"If you're a new parent or a new grandparent, then you should be getting the pertussis update vaccine to decrease the risk of you actually communicating, or giving, pertussis to the newborn baby," says Dr. Presutti.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I've had stomach issues my whole life, and it seems like my trips to the bathroom are becoming more frequent lately. I've heard of IBD. What is it? What are its symptoms? What can help me if I am diagnosed?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>&nbsp;(IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that usually impacts the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/gastrointestinal-tract/img-20007468">gastrointestinal tract</a>. IBD is an umbrella term for either&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326">ulcerative colitis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Crohn's disease</a>, which are two different conditions with similar origins and inflammatory processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp;Ulcerative colitis involves inflammation along the superficial lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum while Crohn's disease&nbsp;involves inflammation and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/multimedia/ulcers/img-20008060">ulcers</a>&nbsp;that can involve&nbsp;the deeper layers of the digestive tract. This can affect anywhere from the mouth to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/multimedia/the-anal-canal/img-20006922">anus</a>, but&nbsp;most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine and/or the colon.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of inflammatory bowel disease" class="wp-image-221939" style="width:678px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>Symptoms&nbsp;are variable and may sometimes be nonspecific, but the most common symptoms that patients experience are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">bloody stools</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>. Some patients might experience&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894">fatigue</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20352759">fever</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/joint-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050668">joint pain</a>. In some cases, patients develop extraintestinal (organs beyond the intestines) manifestations which can affect different organs in the body such as the eyes, skin, joints or liver.</p>



<p>Most people with IBD are diagnosed before their 30s, but some won't develop the disease until their 50s or older. To diagnose someone with IBD, a patient presents their symptoms to their primary care clinician or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, who takes a thorough history&nbsp;to try to better understand how long the symptoms have been going on. This would lead the healthcare professional to order further testing, which can include an endoscopic evaluation such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">colonoscopy</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922">Biopsies</a>&nbsp;taken during a colonoscopy are needed to confirm a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, there is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease. However, there are many treatment options, including medical, surgical and dietary interventions that can help. The goal of treatment is remission, which means eliminating all the inflammation and getting back to what looks like a normal colon or intestine. The treatment options we use differ from patient to patient depending on the severity and location of the disease. The decision on treatment is shared between the healthcare team and the patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leaving inflammation untreated&nbsp;can lead to further complications. For example, if someone has persistent inflammation in their colon, that increases the risk for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon cancer</a>. If someone has Crohn's disease, they're at increased risk of persistent inflammation causing something called strictures, which is narrowing in the colon or small intestine. Whenever there is a narrowing, it increases the risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20351460">bowel obstruction</a>, which would require surgery to help the bowels open up. This is why we are diligent in getting the right treatment to the patient and getting them to remission.</p>



<p>When it comes to IBD, diet is a question on everyone's mind. We do not have a specific diet for IBD, but we know that focusing on&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/dairy-health/chronic-inflammation-what-it-is-why-its-bad-and-how-you-can-reduce-it/">anti-inflammatory</a>&nbsp;foods and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814#:~:text=Antioxidants%20are%20certain%20nutrients%2C%20such,radicals%20damage%20cells%20and%20DNA.">antioxidants</a>&nbsp;and avoiding&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">processed foods</a>, which can cause inflammation, is beneficial. One diet that I always recommend to most of my patients is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>. The Mediterranean diet is a well-balanced diet that has a lot of anti-inflammatory products and antioxidants in it, so it could be very beneficial for patients who have IBD. Talk to your healthcare team about what is right for you.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Victor Chedid, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterolog</em></strong><strong><em>y, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>
