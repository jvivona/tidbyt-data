<p>"In the late winter, early spring, it can account for 5% to 10% of all the respiratory infections that we diagnose in the United States. So it's definitely out there," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>

<p><strong>Journalists: Broadcast-quality sound bites are available in the downloads at the bottom of the post. Name super/CG: Matthew Binnicker, Ph.D./Laboratory Medicine and Pathology/Mayo Clinic</strong></p>



<p>HMPV is a respiratory illness that generally causes mild symptoms similar to the <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/common-cold/symptoms-causes/syc-20351605?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common cold</a> that usually last just a few days.</p>



<p>"Typically, individuals will progressively feel worse with a runny nose, maybe a sore throat, some slight body aches, perhaps a cough. The symptoms are not typically as severe as other respiratory viruses like <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/respiratory-syncytial-virus/symptoms-causes/syc-20353098?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RSV</a> or especially <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/flu/symptoms-causes/syc-20351719?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>He says, like many other respiratory viruses, HMPV spreads from an infected person or through contact with a contaminated surface, and he emphasizes the importance of proper hand-washing and covering your cough.</p>



<p>"Human metapneumovirus is transmitted in a similar way to other respiratory viruses, like the flu and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID</a> and RSV, mainly through respiratory droplets that are produced while an individual coughs or sneezes. It can also be spread through what we call contaminated fomites. So if an infected individual coughs into their hand and then touches a door handle, another person could come along, touch that door handle, and then self-inoculate the virus into their eyes, nose or mouth. And that's a potential way of transmitting the virus as well," says Dr. Binnicker.</p>



<p>He adds that there is no approved antiviral medication to treat HMPV.</p>



<p>"If you would happen to go in and see your family physician with a few days history of a sore throat and a cough and a runny nose, and you were ultimately diagnosed with human metapneumovirus, they wouldn't be able to prescribe you a medication or an antiviral. They would typically just recommend supportive care. So if there's medication that you can take to reduce any body aches or reduce a fever, and staying well hydrated," says Dr. Binnicker. "Really, it all comes down to supportive care, rather than a specific drug to target the virus."</p>

<p>Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-aging-and-the-benefits-of-exercising/">Mayo Clinic Minute: Aging and the benefits of exercising</a></h2>



<p>There is no magic pill to reverse the aging process. But if you want to counter the biological mechanisms that drive age-related conditions, like the accumulation of senescent cells, you will need to exercise. Dr. Nathan LeBrasseur, director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at Mayo Clinic, says people must prioritize physical activity, especially as they age.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/1-20-mayo-clinic-minute-new-rule-for-healthy-food-labels/">Mayo Clinic Minute: New rule for 'healthy' food labels</a></h2>



<p>What makes a food healthy? For the first time in 30 years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is updating its claim on what food products can use the word "healthy" on their labels. And both the foods being taken off the list and the new foods now approved to use that claim might surprise you.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-year-dieting-tips-for-2025-from-a-mayo-clinic-expert/">New year dieting tips for 2025 from a Mayo Clinic expert</a></h2>



<p>As the new year begins, many people are setting resolutions to eat healthier, stay active and manage their weight through dieting. Dr. Donald Hensrud, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in nutrition and the editor of "The Mayo Clinic Diet," offers some thoughts on weight management.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/3d-models-of-uveal-melanoma-offer-hope-for-improved-treatments/">3D models of uveal melanoma offer hope for improved treatments</a></h2>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have developed organoid models to study uveal melanoma, one of the most common types of eye cancer in adults. Their goal is to use these models to better understand how this disease works and develop treatments for unmet patient needs.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/video-improving-cervical-cancer-screening-with-hpv-self-collection-tests/">Improving cervical cancer screening with HPV self-collection tests</a></h2>



<p>Screening for HPV is important, but there are barriers for some patients to screening tests that require a speculum exam — and that leads to lower screening rates in those populations. ⁠A new option will be offered soon to help with these healthcare disparities.</p>

<p-->Exercising as you age can be challenging. Sometimes it can feel like your body is breaking down. One possible reason for this could be senescent cells, which build up in your body as you get older and contribute to age-related disorders.<p></p>



<p>A recent <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/advance-article/doi/10.1093/gerona/glad257/7390642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study</a> by Mayo Clinic shows that exercise and other physical activities can reduce the number of senescent cells.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lebrasseur-nathan-k-ph-d-m-s/bio-00055041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Nathan LeBrasseur</a>, director of the Robert and Arlene Kogod Center on Aging at Mayo Clinic, says people must prioritize physical activity, especially as they age.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Aging and exercising</h3>



<p>There is no magic pill to reverse the aging process. But if you want to counter the biological mechanisms that drive age-related conditions, like the accumulation of senescent cells, you will need to exercise.</p>



<p>"Just being more active throughout your day appears to be sufficient to reduce kind of the burden of senescence cells in an individual," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Many people tend to lead sedentary lifestyles when they age. But Dr. LeBrasseur says older adults should find ways to become more active throughout the day.</p>



<p>"Dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>He says just adding 30 minutes of activity daily can be beneficial.</p>



<p>"(It) may have benefits for muscle strength or bone health, or maybe even cognitive health and function," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Exercising can beneficial</strong></h3>

<p-->What makes a food healthy? For the first time in 30 years, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is updating its <a href="https://www.fda.gov/food/nutrition-food-labeling-and-critical-foods/use-term-healthy-food-labeling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claim</a> on what food products can use the word "healthy" on their labels.<p></p>



<p>And both the foods being taken off the list and the new foods now approved to use that claim might surprise you.</p>

<p>"This was long overdue. The term 'healthy' as used as a claim for foods is way out of date," says <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/hensrud-donald-d-m-d-m-s/bio-20053543?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Donald Hensrud</a>, a Mayo Clinic physician specializing in nutrition and the editor of "<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/weight-loss/in-depth/mayo-clinic-diet/art-20045460" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mayo Clinic Diet</a>."</p>



<p>Dr. Hensrud says the FDA's updated claim for using the word "healthy" on packaging labels is more in line with the <a href="https://www.dietaryguidelines.gov/sites/default/files/2021-03/Dietary_Guidelines_for_Americans-2020-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dietary Guidelines for Americans</a>, and things like fortified white bread, highly sweetened cereals and yogurt with added sugars will no longer be labeled as "healthy."</p>



<p>"Now, when people see the simple term 'healthy food' on foods, it meets certain criteria. There's evidence supporting its health. It contains low amounts of saturated fat and sodium like it did before, but now also low amounts of sugar," he says.</p>



<p>Some new foods that have been added to the "healthy" label list are fruits, vegetables, eggs, whole grains, fatty fish such as salmon, olive oil, nuts, seeds and even water. "And we know from years of research that these foods are healthy," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>



<p>"The FDA is going to work on a symbol that foods can use that have the healthy claim approved for it, and that'll make it easier for people to identify healthy foods," he says.</p>

<p>Starting a workout program or being physically active takes motivation and commitment. The key is to start slowly and do something you take pleasure in.</p>



<p>"If you hate swimming, don't try to start to become a swimmer. But (if) you enjoy dancing or other activities (such as) gardening, those are forms of activity that once you engage in, you increase your consistency and compliance that will have the most health benefits," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Being active can build muscle strength and improve cognitive and cardiovascular health.</p>



<p>"Three percent, or 30 minutes a day, of our waking hours, if we commit that to physical activity, will have huge benefits," explains Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>



<p>And for those young at heart, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 150 minutes of moderate exercise a week.</p>



<p>"As we get older, dedicating time, purposeful time, to getting some form of aerobic exercise or endurance exercise, like walking or cycling or swimming, and also getting some form of strength training is critically important," says Dr. LeBrasseur.</p>

<p>Excitement filled the auditorium at the <a href="https://www.walleyetank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walleye Tank: Ice Fishing Edition</a>, held recently at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.</p>



<p>Thirteen teams took the stage to present their healthcare innovations to a panel of judges and an audience attending in person and online. Projects ranged from addressing the needs of patients with rare or chronic diseases to improving lives through assistive technology.</p>



<p>Each team had two minutes to pitch its innovation, followed by three minutes of Q&amp;A with the judges. Presenters addressed five key questions: Why is it a problem? What is your solution? Why you? Why now? And how is it a business?</p>



<p>Modeled after the TV series "Shark Tank," the <a href="https://www.walleyetank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Walleye Tank</a> is Minnesota's premier life sciences pitching competition. It provides medical and life science startups with an opportunity to raise capital and network with potential partners. Contestants pitch their projects to a panel of judges, or "Walleyes," vying for cash prizes while receiving valuable feedback and exposure that may advance their innovations.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bridging the gap between invention and commercialization</strong></h2>



<p>Support from pitch competitions like the Walleye Tank helps innovators bring their ideas to market and improve the lives of people with health challenges.</p>



<p>Stefan Madansingh, Ph.D., of <a href="https://businessdevelopment.mayoclinic.org/about/ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Ventures</a>, outlined the journey of turning a novel healthcare device,&nbsp;therapy&nbsp;or technology from concept to market ― a process that he said can take years to even decades.</p>



<p>"Healthcare startups fundamentally&nbsp;start with the unmet patient needs," Dr. Madansingh explained. However, he emphasized that most innovations fail to bridge the gap between invention and commercialization.</p>



<p>"The technology&nbsp;is almost always only 25% of the solution when you want to actually get it to patients," he said. "Everything we've talked about here ― the IP (intellectual property),&nbsp;the business model, the sales strategy,&nbsp;the fundraising, the leadership ―&nbsp;matter as much or more."</p>



<p>Ron Thacker, Ed.D., entrepreneurial education program coordinator for Mayo Clinic Research Innovation, and Maria Ploessl, chief of staff for University of Minnesota Technology Commercialization, served as co-masters of ceremonies. Alisha Peters, project assistant for Mayo Clinic Research Innovation, and Katie Breslin, office manager and event associate for University of Minnesota Technology Commercialization, co-organized the event.</p>



<p>Walleye Tank is one of several pitch competitions sponsored by Mayo Clinic Research Innovation, which provides education, consultation, project management and funding to accelerate Mayo Clinic innovations in patient care.</p>

<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Check out a few of the most popular News Network stories on @mayoclinic social media this past week.</h3>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-personalized-vaccines-target-cancer-tumors/">Mayo Clinic Minute: How personalized vaccines target cancer tumors</a></h2>



<p>Vaccines are helpful in protecting against the flu and COVID-19, but could they also play a role in the fight against cancer? Imagine a future where every cancer treatment is personalized to each patient, precisely targeting their unique cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Dr. Keith Knutson,&nbsp;a cancer vaccine researcher at Mayo Clinic, explains how the development of personalized lung&nbsp;cancer vaccines&nbsp;is giving hope to patients.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-mri-for-dense-breasts-what-to-know/">Mayo Clinic Minute: MRI for dense breasts — what to know</a></h2>



<p>Nearly half of all women who have had a mammogram to screen for breast cancer have been identified as having dense breasts. This makes it more challenging to detect breast cancer. That's one reason why it's recommended to have an additional screening done.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-leg-pain-it-may-be-your-arteries/">Mayo Clinic Q and A: Leg pain? It may be your arteries</a></h2>



<p>Peripheral artery disease&nbsp;is a common, chronic medical condition that affects circulation in the body due to narrowed arteries. The narrowing of arteries is caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, which reduces blood flow from the heart to different regions of the body. This can affect the arms, but most commonly, it is an issue found in the legs.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/vaginal-microbiome-may-predict-postoperative-urinary-tract-infections/">Vaginal microbiome may predict postsurgical urinary tract infections&nbsp;</a></h2>



<p>Each year, many women undergo surgery for pelvic organ prolapse, a condition where weakened muscles and tissues allow organs like the bladder or uterus, to shift and press against the vaginal wall. While the surgical procedure often alleviates symptoms, many women experience urinary tract infections, a common postsurgical complication. ⁠</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-contributes-to-national-alzheimers-disease-research-priorities-in-new-report/">Mayo Clinic contributes to national Alzheimer's disease research priorities in new report</a></h2>



<p>Alzheimer's disease affects millions of Americans, robbing them of memory and affecting families and loved ones. A new report identifies research priorities for the next decade for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. ⁠</p>



<p>Nilüfer Ertekin-Taner, M.D., Ph.D., a Mayo Clinic neuroscientist, served on the select ad hoc committee that developed the report, which includes prevention and treatment strategies.</p>

<p>"Don't set too lofty a goal, and don't focus only on weight," he says. "I see people who understandably want to lose 50 pounds, but an example I use in financial terms is that trying to lose 50 pounds is like saying, 'I want to make a million dollars' without having a good financial plan to do it. The process of how to do it is much more important than the outcome."</p>

<p>Focus on the process of lifestyle changes in diet and physical activity, and that will best help to achieve the outcome of weight los<strong>s.</strong>&nbsp;Start small with changes you can sustain long term. Practical, realistic and enjoyable steps are key. Avoid drastic plans you can't keep up with, like exercising two hours a day, which often leads to burnout.</p>



<p>"This doesn't have to be drudgery. Eating healthfully, living a physically active lifestyle and managing weight can be an enjoyable process," he says.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Where to start?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Dr. Hensrud says there are many programs available, and he encourages people to find one that promotes health and weight loss.</p>



<p>"If people ate only 500 calories from jelly beans, they'd lose weight. But obviously that isn't the healthiest way to do it," he says.</p>



<p>Dr. Hensurd supports the Mayo Clinic Diet, which is available as a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/new-year-new-goals-new-edition-of-the-mayo-clinic-diet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book and an online program</a>. The program focuses on sustainable lifestyle changes, including eating more fruits and vegetables, getting regular physical activity, and building healthy habits over time.</p>



<p>"Our online program has many different tools and resources to help people lead a healthier and more enjoyable lifestyle, such as tracking diet and physical activity habits, ideas for recipes and meal plans, social support, and others," he says.</p>



<p>The program also offers group coaching and integration with fitness devices.</p>



<p>"It's a lifestyle that anyone can do, and it can be effective in helping people manage weight and improve their health," says Dr. Hensrud.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong> When the holidays end, it's hard to have things to look forward to and find motivation to exercise. How can I stay ahead of the slump and help my family stay active?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong> As winter settles in, shorter days and colder nights can feel dull. But the mystery of winter nights also offers opportunities for fun, joy, connection and adventure through outdoor activities. Winter nights can be turned into an enchanting experience.</p>



<p>Dressing appropriately is the key to embracing nighttime winter fun in&nbsp;colder climates&nbsp;based on the activity and weather. This may include layers, a hat and mittens or gloves. Don't forget to check the weather forecast.</p>



<p>Give these cold-weather activities a try:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Hiking.</strong> Many parks maintain trails for winter hiking and offer guided nighttime nature events. Wear appropriate footwear or strap-on snowshoes. Stick to well-marked trails and take along water and a flashlight.</li>



<li><strong>Ice skating or sledding. </strong>Many cities offer outdoor rinks and designated sledding spots. Neighborhood hills or a DIY backyard rink can provide nearby fun. Check that rinks are well-maintained and choose sledding hills free of obstacles. Inspect your skates and sleds before using them and don't forget to wear helmets.</li>



<li><strong>Play tag or build snow creations.</strong> Playing in the snow brings laughter and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/exercise/art-20048389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exercise</a>. Dress in layers to keep warm and dry, and take breaks indoors to warm up and avoid <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/frostbite/symptoms-causes/syc-20372656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">frostbite</a>.</li>



<li><strong>Playground discovery.</strong> Playgrounds are fun year-round, even in winter. Try swinging or rolling snowballs down the slides for a new twist on winter playground fun. Watch for icy patches on equipment, and ensure the area is well-lit to avoid slips or falls in the dark.</li>



<li><strong>Stargazing.</strong> Winter nights often offer clearer skies, making it ideal for stargazing. Bring a blanket, download a star map app on your phone to enhance your viewing knowledge and pack warm beverages. Dress warmly, bring a flashlight, and let someone know your location if you're venturing to a remote spot.</li>
</ul>



<p>For those in warmer climates, winter nights offer unique opportunities to celebrate without the snow. Here are a few ideas:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Beach bonfire or sunset picnic.</strong> Grab some blankets, pack snacks or an easy meal, and bring hot drinks to enjoy the evening. If you're setting up a bonfire, use designated fire pits and follow any local guidelines. Remember to bring flashlights or lanterns, and always pack out what you bring in to leave the area clean.</li>



<li><strong>Evening hike.</strong> Winter months offer cooler evenings that are perfect for exploring local trails. Many parks organize guided night hikes or special stargazing events. Stick to familiar trails and bring <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/water/art-20044256" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plenty of water</a>, as nights in the desert or arid areas can be drier than expected. Always carry a flashlight or headlamp and let someone know your hiking route.</li>



<li><strong>Holiday light boat parade.</strong> Many coastal or lakeside communities organize holiday-light boat parades with boats decorated in festive lights. Bundle up and be sure to bring a flashlight to navigate docks and dark areas safely.</li>



<li><strong>Nighttime zoo or garden lights tour.</strong> Many zoos and botanical gardens offer night tours during the holiday season with sparkling lights and seasonal decorations throughout. Wear comfortable shoes and keep kids close by. Use designated paths and trails.</li>



<li><strong>Outdoor movie night.</strong> Set up a projector and screen in your backyard or a park. Relax with blankets, popcorn and hot chocolate or cider. Check the weather forecast for rain or wind and ensure everyone wears warm layers of clothing. Safely set up any heaters or lanterns.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I'm 52 years old and enjoy long walks with my husband and our dog. I recently started to experience pain in my left calf during our walks. The leg pain goes away when I rest. Because I have a history of high blood pressure, I went to see my primary care physician and was diagnosed with peripheral artery disease. What is this condition, and what treatments are available? Will I need surgery?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-how-is-peripheral-artery-disease-diagnosed/">Peripheral artery disease</a>&nbsp;is a common, chronic medical condition that affects circulation in the body due to narrowed arteries. The narrowing of arteries is caused by a buildup of fatty deposits, called plaque, which reduces blood flow from the heart to different regions of the body. This can affect the arms, but most commonly, it is an issue found in the legs.&nbsp;</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Medical illustration of peripheral artery disease" class="wp-image-348220" style="width:690px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2022/09/peripheral-artery-disease-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>The risk of developing peripheral artery disease increases with age, particularly for those over 65 or after 50 if you have certain risk factors. Factors that can contribute to your risk include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A family history of peripheral artery disease, heart disease or stroke</li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-pressure/symptoms-causes/syc-20373410">High blood pressure</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/symptoms-causes/syc-20350800">High cholesterol</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444">Diabetes</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/chronic-kidney-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20354521">Chronic kidney disease</a></li>



<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742">Obesity</a>&nbsp;(a body mass index over 30)</li>



<li>Smoking tobacco/using tobacco products</li>
</ul>



<p>Many people with peripheral artery disease have mild or no symptoms, while others experience leg pain when walking or even at rest. The severity of your symptoms and the extent of the blockage are used to categorize the stage of your peripheral artery disease and inform specific treatment options.</p>



<p>There are two stages of peripheral artery disease. The early stage is called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/claudication/symptoms-causes/syc-20370952">claudication</a>, when people experience pain when walking or engaging in activity. In this stage, the pain begins during exercise and ends with rest. It is usually felt in the calves, thighs and buttocks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The advanced, severe stage of peripheral artery disease is called critical limb threatening ischemia. During this stage, pain is often felt in the feet, even without walking, and is worse during rest or when lying down. You also may experience open sores or wounds on your limbs or feet that won't heal. Critical limb threatening ischemia may cause tissue death or gangrene on your feet. If this goes untreated, it can lead to leg amputation.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peripheral-artery-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20350563">Treatment</a>&nbsp;for peripheral artery disease varies depending on its severity. When it's diagnosed early, lifestyle changes and treatment of underlying medical conditions are often enough to manage symptoms. This may mean taking appropriate medications to control high blood pressure and high cholesterol, controlling blood sugar levels if you have diabetes, quitting smoking, eating a healthier diet with fewer fatty and highly processed foods, and regular exercise or engaging in a walking program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more advanced disease, restoration of blood flow is necessary in addition to lifestyle changes. Therefore, the goal of surgery is to restore blood flow and prevent leg amputation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One treatment option is percutaneous endovascular surgery, a minimally invasive approach. In this operation, the surgeon guides a thin, flexible tube called a catheter through the groin, foot or wrist to the narrowed part of the artery. A tiny balloon is inflated to widen the blocked artery and improve blood flow. A stent, a small wire mesh tube, may also be placed in the artery to keep it open.</p>



<p>The more invasive surgical option is bypass surgery. The surgeon creates a path around the blocked artery using either a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body or a synthetic one. One end of the healthy vein is connected to the artery above the blockage, and the other is attached below the blockage so that the blood will detour into the bypass.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When diagnosed with peripheral artery disease, it’s important to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/vascular-and-endovascular-surgery/overview/ovc-20458819">consult a vascular surgeon</a>&nbsp;to determine the best treatment for you. Vascular surgeons can perform both minimally invasive procedures and complex bypass surgery.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By incorporating lifestyle changes and treating any underlying medical conditions early, you can significantly improve your quality of life and prevent progression to more severe stages of disease. Peripheral artery disease is a marker for your overall cardiovascular health, and managing it correctly can lead to a longer, healthier life. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/shuja-fahad-m-b-b-s/bio-20323775"><strong><em>Fahad Shuja, M.B.B.S.,</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;Vascular Surgery, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong><strong></strong></p>
