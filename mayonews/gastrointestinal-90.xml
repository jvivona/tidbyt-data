<p><em><strong>Editor's note:&nbsp;</strong>March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month.</em></p>



<p><a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-q-and-a-understanding-colorectal-cancer/">Colorectal cancer</a> is no longer a disease of older people. People in their 50s, 40s and younger are increasingly being diagnosed with cancers of the colon and rectum. Incidence rates increased by about 2% per year in people younger than 50 during the past decade, according to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">American Cancer Society</a>. In 2019, 20% of colorectal cancers were in people ages 54 years or younger, up from 11% in 1995.</p>



<p>Another trend: Rectal cancer is more common than colon cancer in younger people. Of the estimated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.org/content/dam/cancer-org/research/cancer-facts-and-statistics/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures/colorectal-cancer-facts-and-figures-2023.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">46,050 new cases of rectal cancer</a>&nbsp;in 2023, 37% will be in people younger than 50 versus 24% in people 65 or older.</p>



<p>Because of these trends, experts now recommend screening for colorectal cancer at age 45. But Derek Ebner, M.D., a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-cancer-center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>&nbsp;gastroenterologist, says adults of all ages should be aware of the symptoms of colon and rectal cancer and report them to a healthcare professional.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of rectal cancer" class="wp-image-195705" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/07/a-medical-illustration-of-rectal-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>"When we detect cancer early, and it's still confined to the colon or the rectum, that five-year survival is wonderful — it's 90% or better. Detecting cancer later, when it's had an opportunity to move beyond the colon or the rectum, the five-year survival is much lower — typically 15% or less," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>Here's what you need to know to prevent colorectal cancer or catch it early when it's most treatable:</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Everyone is at average or high risk of colorectal cancer.</h2>



<p>"The truth is everyone's at risk for colorectal cancer," says Dr. Ebner. "But we typically divide people into two groups, those who are average risk and those who are high risk."</p>



<p>People at average risk of colorectal cancer might not experience symptoms associated with the disease and don't have any&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">known factors</a>&nbsp;that make them high risk.</p>



<p>"For those at high risk, there tends to be at least one of three variables: A medical condition, a genetic condition, or a family history that places them at higher risk," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<p>Medical conditions that increase the risk of colorectal cancer include a personal history of colorectal cancer or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-polyps/symptoms-causes/syc-20352875" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polyps</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diabetes/symptoms-causes/syc-20371444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diabetes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">obesity</a>.</p>



<p>Genetic conditions that increase the risk of colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/familial-adenomatous-polyposis/symptoms-causes/syc-20372443" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Familial adenomatous polyposis</a>&nbsp;(FAP) is a rare condition caused by a defect in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. While most people inherit the gene from a parent, the genetic mutation occurs spontaneously in 25% to 30% of people with FAP.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/lynch-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20374714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lynch syndrome</a>&nbsp;is a condition that increases the risk of many kinds of cancer, including colon and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/endometrial-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">endometrial cancer</a>, and it is passed from parents to children.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/08/Colorectal-Cancer.jpg" alt="illustration of colorectal cancer" class="wp-image-277806" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/08/Colorectal-Cancer.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2020/08/Colorectal-Cancer-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>Family history associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer involves a first-degree family member — a parent or sibling — with a colorectal cancer diagnosis or precancerous polyps. If you have a family history, you must start screening sooner and perhaps more often than people at average risk.</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner says healthcare professionals don't yet know the reason for the increased rate of colorectal cancer among younger people, but suspect environmental factors are involved. "Over the last 50 years, we've had major changes in diet —&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2024/02/06/is-there-a-connection-between-ultraprocessed-food-and-cancer/">ultraprocessed</a>&nbsp;food, higher quantities of red meats," he says. "These changes have perhaps led to changes in gut bacteria. Our gut microbiome might not be as protective as it once was. We also question the role of less exercise and increasing obesity rates."</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner encourages everyone to reduce their risk of colorectal cancer by&nbsp;<a href="https://cancerblog.mayoclinic.org/2023/02/01/plant-power-using-diet-to-lower-cancer-risk/">eating a more plant-based diet</a>&nbsp;and exercising regularly.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Non-invasive screening options exist, but you may be unable to avoid a colonoscopy forever.</h2>



<p>Most colorectal polyps do not cause symptoms, so you may have polyps without knowing it. This is why beginning colorectal cancer screening at the recommended age of 45 is critical.</p>



<p>Screening reduces the risk of cancer by identifying polyps in the colon and rectum that could develop into cancer. You may need to begin screening younger than 45 if you have risk factors. Ask your healthcare professional when you should start screening.</p>



<p>Dr. Ebner says it's impossible to overemphasize the importance of screening. "If we're able to identify polyps, we have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer. If we diagnose cancer, unfortunately, we've missed that opportunity," he says.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-colonoscopy-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of colonoscopy" class="wp-image-213269" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-colonoscopy-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/08/a-medical-illustration-of-colonoscopy-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>In the U.S.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colonoscopy</a>&nbsp;is the most common screening method. A long, flexible tube (colonoscope) is inserted into the rectum during a colonoscopy. A tiny video camera at the tip of the tube allows a healthcare professional to look for changes — such as swollen, irritated tissues, polyps or cancer — in the colon and the rectum. The professional can also remove polyps or other types of abnormal tissue through the scope during a colonoscopy. Sedation or anesthesia is usually recommended.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/colon-cancer-screening/art-20046825" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">non-invasive option</a>&nbsp;for colorectal cancer screening is a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/stool-dna-test/about/pac-20385153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stool DNA test</a>(offered under the brand name Cologuard), which uses a stool sample to look for signs of colon cancer. The test checks for changes in cells' DNA. Certain DNA changes indicate that cancer is present or might develop. The test also looks for hidden blood in the stool.</p>



<p>"If the result of a stool DNA test or another non-invasive test is positive, it's critical to follow up with a colonoscopy," says Dr. Ebner.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Know the symptoms of colorectal cancer, and don't wait to talk to a healthcare professional if you experience them.</h2>



<p>The symptoms of colon and rectal cancer can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>A change in bowel habits, such as diarrhea, constipation or more frequent bowel movements.</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding or blood in the stool.</li>



<li>Narrow stool.</li>



<li>Ongoing discomfort in the belly area, such as cramps, gas or pain.</li>



<li>A feeling that the bowel doesn't empty.</li>



<li>Weakness or fatigue.</li>



<li>Losing weight without trying.</li>
</ul>



<p>People younger than 50 who develop colorectal cancer seem to experience slightly different symptoms than older people diagnosed with the disease, says Dr. Ebner. "We still see abdominal pain and blood after bowel movements, but the change in bowel habits is more often diarrhea," he says.</p>



<p>A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2023/colorectal-cancer-young-people-warning-signs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent study</a>&nbsp;of people diagnosed with early-onset colorectal cancer confirms this. Study participants experienced four warning signs in the period of three months to two years before their diagnosis:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Abdominal pain</li>



<li>Rectal bleeding</li>



<li>Diarrhea</li>



<li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>"Blood loss after a bowel movement can lead to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/iron-deficiency-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355034" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">iron deficiency anemia</a>," says Dr. Ebner. "But sometimes that blood loss is slow or small, so you may not see it. If we see a sign of iron deficiency on a blood test, that will prompt us to explore further."</p>



<p>If you notice any of these symptoms, contact your healthcare professional. "These symptoms can be embarrassing, but I can't stress enough — if you have any of them, share them with a healthcare professional. We see folks experiencing these symptoms for months, sometimes up to a year," Dr. Ebner says. "Any delay in sharing this information translates to a delay in diagnosis, which can lead to later-stage cancer, and later-stage cancers can be more challenging to treat and have lower five-year survival rates. Don't delay. Make an appointment.</p>

<p>"Stages 3 and 4 are considered advanced stages, where the cancer goes into the lymph nodes in stage 3 disease, and it goes into distant organs like the lungs, liver or bones in stage 4 disease," says Dr. Majeed.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">When colorectal cancer spreads</h2>



<p>The liver is the most common organ colorectal spreads to.</p>



<p>"We are offering liver transplantation as an option to select patients. We have a&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-therapy-for-colorectal-liver-metastases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hepatic artery infusion pump program</a>&nbsp;also available for those patients where the cancer has spread from the colon or the rectum to the liver," he says.</p>



<p>The pump delivers chemotherapy directly to artery that supplies the liver. He says, in addition to surgery, treatment options include better drugs, immunotherapy and targeted therapies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"We have surgeons who specialize in advanced procedures such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/endocrinology/news/role-for-cytoreduction-surgery-in-metastatic-adrenocortical-carcinoma-new-study/mac-20535815" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cytoreductive surgery</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-new-chemotherapy-approach-for-treating-stomach-cancer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HIPEC</a>, which is a form of specialized chemotherapy given into the peritoneum for select patients," Dr. Majeed says.</p>



<p>With all these advanced options, Dr. Majeed remains cautiously optimistic.</p>



<p>"Colorectal cancer is a type of cancer where, even if it's stage 4, there is a chance of cure in select cases," he says.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I just turned 45 and am dreading my first <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-the-importance-of-a-colonoscopy/">colonoscopy</a>. Why do I need to be screened if I'm not having issues? Can you walk me through the process?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;Feeling anxious or afraid surrounding a procedure, particularly when you've never done it before, is completely normal. The purpose of <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">screening</a> is to act before someone develops symptoms. If we're able to identify&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-you-need-to-know-about-polyps-in-your-colon/">polyps</a>, which are precancerous lesions in the lining of the colon, we would then have the opportunity to remove them and prevent the development of cancer in the first place. So through screening, we can prevent cancer. At the time of diagnosing cancer, we've missed that opportunity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are a number of ways we can screen for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colorectal cancer</a>. In the U.S., we most often use a&nbsp;colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is an invasive test, but it allows us an opportunity to not only see polyps, but also remove them at the same time. For people with&nbsp;no additional risk factors besides age, it is recommended to start screening at the age of 45. If other risk factors are present, though, it may be recommended to have a colonoscopy sooner than 45.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-tips-to-make-colonoscopy-bowel-prep-easier/">colon preparation</a>&nbsp;prior to the colonoscopy is key. The goal of colonoscopy prep is to make sure that there is nothing in the colon by using a laxative liquid solution. Then, at the time of the colonoscopy, we're able to see and detect even small precancerous lesions so they can be removed.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="927" height="521" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1.jpg" alt="pouring colonoscopy bowel prep mix into the bottle cap" class="wp-image-323297" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1.jpg 927w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2021/11/pouring-colonoscopy-prep-mix-into-the-bottle-cap-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 927px) 100vw, 927px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Proper preparation for colonoscopy is key to success</figcaption></figure>



<p>It is very common to hear complaints from patients about the preparation, such as the consistency or taste of the solution, cramping,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal bloating</a>&nbsp;or discomfort. That's to be anticipated. Unfortunately, some patients also experience&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/nausea/basics/definition/sym-20050736">nausea</a>. Try slowing down how fast you are drinking the solution. For those who tend to struggle with the taste or consistency, try drinking it through a straw. You can also bite into a small wedge of lime or lemon, or you can chew gum or ice between drinks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After you finish the last of the prep solution and check in for your appointment, you'll often be greeted by the front desk team and then escorted back by a healthcare team member. They will review things like your medical history and medications and see how the colon prep treated you. There is a risk that you may have to come back and repeat the test at a later time if the colon prep was not adequate.</p>



<p>Another critical thing they will do is establish your intravenous therapy or IV. The IV is the route in which they will give you the medication to help make the procedure a little bit more comfortable. Some people don't do any&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/anesthesia/about/pac-20384568">sedation</a>&nbsp;at all, but it is totally appropriate to opt for it. There are several different ways that sedation could be done for the procedure. A lot of that depends upon how the procedure is scheduled with your healthcare team. Then, you will end up going back to the procedure room where they will review the nature of the procedure before starting the colonoscopy. Afterwards, there's a bit of a recovery period, and then you're able to head back home. Because of the sedation, we don't want people driving, consuming alcohol or making any critical decisions for 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We still don't have a perfect recipe for preventing polyps, but maintaining a&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/nutrition-fitness/11-tips-for-healthier-eating-habits/">healthy diet</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/exercise/faq-20057916">exercise</a>&nbsp;can protect you. It is important to be aware of any symptoms and then follow through with screening. Best of luck as you take this important first step. —&nbsp;<em>Derek Ebner,&nbsp;M.D.,&nbsp;<strong>Gastroenterology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota.</strong></em></p>

<p>Colorectal cancer, the third-most common cancer in the U.S., has been rising among younger people for the past two decades. It is not one type of cancer but two cancers: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">colon cancer</a>, which starts in the large intestine, and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/rectal-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352884?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rectal cancer</a>, which begins in the last part of the large intestine, known as the rectum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Historically, colorectal cancer was equally divided along the colon and rectum, but particularly for those with early onset colorectal cancer — age less than 50<sub>&nbsp;</sub>— we're seeing higher rates of rectal cancer among the younger onset," says Dr. Ebner.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Warning signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>Dr. Ebner says four key symptoms have been identified for people under 50 who are diagnosed with colorectal cancer.</p>



<p>"Abdominal pain, diarrhea, seeing blood with bowel motions, as well as iron deficiency anemia," he says.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="804" height="452" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg" alt="Graphic of warning signs of colorectal cancer with Mayo Clnic identifier" class="wp-image-383697" style="width:856px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1.jpeg 804w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/03/Warning-signs-16x9-1-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 804px) 100vw, 804px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Warning signs of colorectal cancer</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Dr. Ebner notes that blood loss after bowel movements, even if not visibly apparent, can lead to low iron levels.</p>



<p>"If on a blood test, for example, we see a sign of iron deficiency, that would then prompt us to explore further," he says.</p>



<p>Even though it may be embarrassing, he stresses, "If you have any of those symptoms, you need to share it with a healthcare provider. That way, they can navigate those subsequent steps."</p>



<p>Which can lead to early treatment and better outcomes.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Reducing risks of colorectal cancer</h2>



<div style="height:15px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>While it's not possible to completely prevent cancer, there are ways to reduce your risks and that includes following a healthy lifestyle.</p>



<p>"Abiding by a healthy lifestyle is critical," says Dr. Ebner. "Following a well-rounded diet,  staying physically active, for instance, perhaps can be protective. The other key, though, is just being very mindful of those symptoms, and then also underscoring the importance of screening."</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Screening</strong>: Talk to your healthcare team about colorectal cancer screening.</li>



<li><strong>Exercise</strong>: Aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days.</li>



<li><strong>Nutrition</strong>: Eat fruits, veggies and whole grains.</li>



<li><strong>Weight</strong>: Maintain a healthy weight.</li>



<li><strong>Lifestyle</strong>: Don't smoke, limit alcohol consumption.</li>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I've had a sensitive stomach since I can remember. My life has been constantly inconvenienced by too many trips to the bathroom. My family thinks I have undiagnosed irritable bowel syndrome. I should have sought care sooner, but what can I do now to treat it? What causes IBS? What are its symptoms?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;First off, you are not alone.&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/4-27-ready-mayo-clinic-minute-how-to-cope-with-irritable-bowel-syndrome/">Irritable bowel syndrome</a>&nbsp;(IBS) is common and affects approximately 1 in 10 adults in the U.S. IBS is characterized by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>&nbsp;with disordered defecation (<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/constipation/symptoms-causes/syc-20354253">constipation</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>&nbsp;or both). IBS can generally be easily treated with a combination of education, reassurance, diet and medications.</p>



<p>IBS is categorized as a disorder of gut-brain interaction. This means that the bidirectional pathway between the brain and the gut is overactive. Patients with IBS are more sensitive in their gut than other patients. IBS may develop due to genetic reasons or insults to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/gastrointestinal-tract/img-20007468#:~:text=Your%20digestive%20tract%20stretches%20from,absorb%20nutrients%20and%20process%20waste.">gastrointestinal</a>&nbsp;(GI) tract including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/food-poisoning/symptoms-causes/syc-20356230">food poisoning</a>, prior infections, surgeries, trauma and stressful life events.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/stress-symptoms/art-20050987">Stress</a>&nbsp;can greatly affect the GI tract via the brain-gut axis. This can include physical, emotional or financial stress and other types.</p>



<p>The key&nbsp;symptom of IBS is abdominal pain, which would be present at least one day per week on average. In addition, patients have symptoms of disordered defecation, meaning constipation (going days without a bowel movement or straining during a bowel movement) or diarrhea (watery, loose and urgent bowel movements). Some patients have alternating constipation and diarrhea. Overriding symptoms for many patients include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/symptoms-causes/syc-20372709">gas</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gas-and-gas-pains/in-depth/gas-and-gas-pains/art-20044739#:~:text=Distension%20is%20a%20visible%20or,bloating%20is%20not%20fully%20understood.">bloating</a>&nbsp;and distension, which means a visible or measurable increase in belly size.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Patients often wonder when to see a healthcare professional. A diagnosis of IBS is based on:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">Unintentional weight loss</a></li>



<li>New&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20351360">anemia</a></li>



<li>Family history of IBS or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colorectal cancer</a></li>
</ul>



<p>It is important to note that for most patients, extensive testing is not required to make a diagnosis of IBS, but rather taking a careful history and performing a thoughtful physical exam while using the criteria above. Since IBS is a disorder of gut hypersensitivity and of the gut-brain axis, blood tests, X-rays,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">colonoscopies</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675">CT scans</a>&nbsp;and other tests generally do not reveal an underlying problem such as an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/symptoms-causes/syc-20354223">ulcer</a>&nbsp;or a blockage.</p>



<p>It is also important to note that the "best" therapy for IBS is very patient-independent. Every patient is a unique individual with different types and levels of symptoms:&nbsp;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mild symptoms: Symptoms are somewhat bothersome but not intrusive.</li>



<li>Moderate symptoms: Symptoms are affecting daily quality of life.</li>



<li>Severe symptoms: You may have been to the emergency department because of your symptoms.</li>
</ul>



<p>One of the exciting things in the field of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterology</a>&nbsp;is the recognition in the last 10 years that we have this very dynamic gut-brain connection, this bidirectional pathway. What that really means to a patient is that it's not just the standard prescription of over-the-counter medications for IBS with diarrhea or adding more fiber to help improve symptoms of constipation — it's using different therapies such as FDA-approved medications, behavioral therapy and diet to quiet down this hyperactive, extra-sensitive GI tract in either the brain or gut. This improves overall symptoms, especially that of abdominal pain, which is the cornerstone of the diagnosis of IBS. The future is exciting, and there is hope for you and many others.&nbsp;<em>—</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lacy-brian-e-m-d-ph-d/bio-20392407"><strong>Brian Lacy, M.D., Ph.D</strong></a><strong><em>., Gastroenterology,</em></strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, Florida</strong></em><em></em></p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I'm hearing more about the exposome and the role of the environment on our health. Can you tell me more about how it is being studied? I'm worried about the future when I read about studies that show microplastics and chemicals accumulating in our environment.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/genomics/2022/09/06/from-the-genome-to-the-exposome/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&nbsp;defines the exposome as the measure of all environmental exposures, from prenatal stages through a person's lifetime, and how those exposures interact with genetic factors to affect health. The term is very inclusive. It includes, for example, diet; pollution; and natural substances, such as radiation. Everyone's exposome is unique.</p>



<p>I appreciate your concern about <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/exploring-the-exposome/">environmental exposures.</a> The point I like to make is that not all exposures are harmful. Some exposures may protect us from disease. When we're talking about the exposome, it includes elements that are a risk for health, such as tobacco use, and elements protecting us from illness, such as access to green space.</p>



<p>Historically, researchers have studied some environmental exposures. Epidemiological studies in the past have told us that excessive alcohol use, for example, has an effect on the human body, and this relates to disease. We have also known that exposures to some bacteria cause disease, such as salmonella or tuberculosis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Graphic: The exposome is the measure of a person's lifetime of environmental expsures and impact on health.
" class="wp-image-386729" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>But given that there are millions of different types of environmental exposures, better and more systematic studies are needed to understand what this means to our health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a scientific field, the exposome explores exposures that have an effect on humans biology. For me, as a physician and researcher, I would like to know more about exposures that affect our genes, cells and organs, or, in other words, how exposures affect human biology. Your exposome is the environmental complement to your complete set of DNA, called your genome.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have more recently realized that only about 15% of most disease risk can be attributed to genetic elements. So we are left with the question: What else contributes to disease? Families, of course, share not only genes but their environment. They live in the same household. And this is how exposome science started, to try to be able to assess environmental exposures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last roughly 50 years, chemicals have been mass produced by humans. Decades ago, we couldn't measure chemicals in our bloodstream in a scalable and affordable way. So we used questionnaires to ask, "Do you smoke?" "Do you drink?" "Have you been exposed to pesticides?" We were looking for the outcomes of those exposures to human health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in my laboratory, we were studying a rare liver disease called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a>, and we asked a decade ago whether patients were exposed to pesticides, as well as other environmental elements. But the questionnaires didn't show a difference between healthy people and those with primary sclerosing cholangitis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, when we could use blood tests to measure chemicals in the bloodstream, we found a significant difference in a specific pesticide present among primary sclerosing cholangitis patients compared with healthy people.</p>



<p>So, based on several studies, we now know that pesticides are in our food chain and in our bloodstream in small amounts, and we need to know how they affect human biology and disease.</p>



<p>Also, massive plastic production within the last 70 years also has created microparticles that can be found inside people's tissues. We need to study these exposures both in health and in diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory illness and autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, when we do studies, often we find chemicals that are more prevalent in healthy people compared to patients with diseases. Scientists are working to identify those elements associated with wellness or with a lack of disease because these substances may protect us from illness. For example, some studies have shown that drinking coffee may reduce risk of neurological disease or liver disease. We need to understand this in more depth for therapeutic opportunities.</p>



<p>Current methodologies enable us to measure the exposome better than before through blood, urine, saliva and hair. I envision that 10 years from now, if not earlier, we will have screens of exposures that we will measure in our bloodstream. That will become part of a person's care at some point in the future and help us guide lifestyle changes, prevention strategies and make diagnosis as well as treatment decisions for patients. —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lazaridis-konstantinos-n-m-d/bio-20054459"><strong><em>Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterology/Hepatology and Center for Individualized Medicine</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I've had stomach issues my whole life, and it seems like my trips to the bathroom are becoming more frequent lately. I've heard of IBD. What is it? What are its symptoms? What can help me if I am diagnosed?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>&nbsp;(IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that usually impacts the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/gastrointestinal-tract/img-20007468">gastrointestinal tract</a>. IBD is an umbrella term for either&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326">ulcerative colitis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Crohn's disease</a>, which are two different conditions with similar origins and inflammatory processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp;Ulcerative colitis involves inflammation along the superficial lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum while Crohn's disease&nbsp;involves inflammation and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/multimedia/ulcers/img-20008060">ulcers</a>&nbsp;that can involve&nbsp;the deeper layers of the digestive tract. This can affect anywhere from the mouth to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/multimedia/the-anal-canal/img-20006922">anus</a>, but&nbsp;most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine and/or the colon.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of inflammatory bowel disease" class="wp-image-221939" style="width:678px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>Symptoms&nbsp;are variable and may sometimes be nonspecific, but the most common symptoms that patients experience are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">bloody stools</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>. Some patients might experience&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894">fatigue</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20352759">fever</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/joint-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050668">joint pain</a>. In some cases, patients develop extraintestinal (organs beyond the intestines) manifestations which can affect different organs in the body such as the eyes, skin, joints or liver.</p>



<p>Most people with IBD are diagnosed before their 30s, but some won't develop the disease until their 50s or older. To diagnose someone with IBD, a patient presents their symptoms to their primary care clinician or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, who takes a thorough history&nbsp;to try to better understand how long the symptoms have been going on. This would lead the healthcare professional to order further testing, which can include an endoscopic evaluation such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">colonoscopy</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922">Biopsies</a>&nbsp;taken during a colonoscopy are needed to confirm a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, there is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease. However, there are many treatment options, including medical, surgical and dietary interventions that can help. The goal of treatment is remission, which means eliminating all the inflammation and getting back to what looks like a normal colon or intestine. The treatment options we use differ from patient to patient depending on the severity and location of the disease. The decision on treatment is shared between the healthcare team and the patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leaving inflammation untreated&nbsp;can lead to further complications. For example, if someone has persistent inflammation in their colon, that increases the risk for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon cancer</a>. If someone has Crohn's disease, they're at increased risk of persistent inflammation causing something called strictures, which is narrowing in the colon or small intestine. Whenever there is a narrowing, it increases the risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20351460">bowel obstruction</a>, which would require surgery to help the bowels open up. This is why we are diligent in getting the right treatment to the patient and getting them to remission.</p>



<p>When it comes to IBD, diet is a question on everyone's mind. We do not have a specific diet for IBD, but we know that focusing on&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/dairy-health/chronic-inflammation-what-it-is-why-its-bad-and-how-you-can-reduce-it/">anti-inflammatory</a>&nbsp;foods and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814#:~:text=Antioxidants%20are%20certain%20nutrients%2C%20such,radicals%20damage%20cells%20and%20DNA.">antioxidants</a>&nbsp;and avoiding&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">processed foods</a>, which can cause inflammation, is beneficial. One diet that I always recommend to most of my patients is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>. The Mediterranean diet is a well-balanced diet that has a lot of anti-inflammatory products and antioxidants in it, so it could be very beneficial for patients who have IBD. Talk to your healthcare team about what is right for you.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Victor Chedid, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterolog</em></strong><strong><em>y, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>The most common form of primary <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> — cancer that starts in the liver — is called hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of cancer often develops in people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis.</p>



<p>"It’s due to a chronic inflammation that leads to liver damage, cirrhosis and eventually to cancer," says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of liver cancer" class="wp-image-174281" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure>



<p>Most people don't have symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. But when symptoms do appear, they may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Yellowing of the eyes and skin.</li>



<li>Unexpected weight loss.</li>



<li>Upper abdominal pain.</li>



<li>White, chalky stools.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liver cancer treatments</h3>



<p>Several promising treatments to manage the disease include targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"Immunotherapy is kind of a novel type of cancer treatment that is designed to boost your immune system to attack the cancer," explains Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<p>Eating a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, and getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk of liver cancer.</p>



<p>"The hope is that we can trigger a tumor specific immune response for every patient,” says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>

<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“Ulcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>
