Typically, stomach cancer is diagnosed in patients in their 60s and 70s, but increasingly it's being diagnosed in younger patients. While rates of stomach cancer in older patients have been declining for decades, early onset stomach cancer is increasing and makes up around <a href="https://www.surgjournal.com/article/S0039-6060(19)30299-5/abstract">30%</a> of stomach cancer diagnoses.<p></p>

<p>"It used to be a cancer of old age, you know, 70s and 80s," says Dr. Grotz. "But now I'm seeing 20-, 30-, 40-year-old people with cancer."</p>



<p>He says many younger patients with stomach cancer are being diagnosed late — when treatment is less effective.</p>

<p>"I think unfortunately, the younger patients, they often think they had a bad meal. They think — even physicians, you know, think — that it's just reflux; they're just stressed out; they're too young to have cancer," says Dr. Grotz.</p>



<p>Symptoms of gastric cancer may be dismissed as minor issues in younger people. Those symptoms can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Weight loss</li>



<li>Reflux</li>



<li>Indigestion</li>



<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>



<li>Anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>"Reflux and having heartburn, indigestion, gastritis, that can be normal, absolutely," says Dr. Grotz. "But you certainly want to be aware of that and evaluate and make sure there's not something more sinister going on."</p>



<p>As for what's causing an increase in gastric cancer among younger people, Dr. Grotz says it could be a new, unknown risk factor, possibly related to food preparation or environmental factors.</p>

<p-->Researchers at Mayo Clinic have discovered how high levels of triglycerides, a type of fat found in the bloodstream, can rapidly damage organs during acute pancreatitis. They discovered in pancreatitis that circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Blocking this breakdown prevented such damage from occurring.<p></p>



<p>The findings, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/184785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, open a new therapeutic avenue for treating pancreatitis by halting the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="600" height="720" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396303" style="width:251px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh.jpg 600w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vijay Singh, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This discovery not only provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind triglyceride-induced organ damage in pancreatitis but also offers a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/singh-vijay-p-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20111292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Singh, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>



<p>Acute <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatitis</a> is a common gastrointestinal disorder that leads to approximately 275,000 hospital admissions annually in the U.S. alone. &nbsp;An estimated 30% of patients with acute pancreatitis have a form of the disease marked by high levels of triglycerides.</p>



<p>Patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis have a higher risk of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=37461868&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persistent organ failure and severe pancreatitis</a>, which often requires life support, prolongs hospitalization and increases mortality rates. Despite these severe outcomes, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36599412/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanisms</a> driving this form of acute pancreatitis have remained unclear until now.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers analyzed triglyceride and fatty acid levels in blood samples from 269 patients with acute pancreatitis. They found that patients with very high triglycerides had more severe disease and higher levels of fatty acids.</p>



<p>In addition, they did experiments in preclinical models to see how metabolizing triglycerides into fatty acids affected organ health. In animals, this process led to organ failure, which could be prevented by blocking an enzyme called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917686/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lipase</a>, which plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="837" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-837x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396305" style="width:365px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-837x1024.jpg 837w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-245x300.jpg 245w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-768x939.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-1256x1536.jpg 1256w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-1675x2048.jpg 1675w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In pancreatitis, circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Illustration: Renee Cannon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The finding could inform new ways to manage triglyceride elevation during pancreatitis. Current treatments, such as the use of the blood thinner heparin to reduce triglycerides, have shown minimal benefit in reducing organ damage or the severity of pancreatitis. Heparin works by breaking down triglycerides, but this process does not significantly improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by Dr. Singh, are currently developing alternative therapies for acute pancreatitis that block the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>



<p>The recent study also sheds light on the implications of using heparin and other treatments that release the enzyme lipase. It found that the worst outcomes were observed in pancreatitis patients receiving nutrition via IV, as intravenous formulations containing triglycerides can be broken down to potentially harmful fatty acids by circulating lipases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team is now investigating the relevance of this finding in patients with elevated lipase levels due to other diseases, such as intestinal, heart and lung conditions. These diseases may silently damage the pancreas, causing it to leak lipase and create a vicious cycle of worsening organ damage.</p>



<p>"Preliminary studies suggest that patients with elevated triglycerides and lipase levels require more frequent admissions to the intensive care unit," says Dr. Singh. "If confirmed, these findings could point to new ways to prevent the progression of these diseases."</p>



<p>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/184785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.</p>

<p>Donna Monroe, an accomplished interior designer and business owner, has always been passionate about music, travel and leading an active lifestyle. Her adventures with her husband have taken her to locations near and far, including on a recent trip that may not have been possible without a lifesaving diagnosis and surgery.</p>



<p>In August 2023, Donna underwent knee replacement surgery near her Delray Beach, Florida, home. An otherwise uneventful procedure came with complications weeks later. She began experiencing severe abdominal pain, which she initially attributed to medication side effects. When Donna’s condition worsened, she went to a local emergency department.</p>



<p>After five days in a local hospital, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, which physicians suspected to be pancreatic cancer. Concerned with this diagnosis, Donna sought a second opinion, which led her to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bi-yan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20206456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Yan Bi</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist, took charge of Donna's case. Dr. Bi ordered scans and labs to help understand what was causing Donna's symptoms.</p>



<p>"It was a Friday afternoon, almost time to call it a day, when I received an urgent call from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chen-frank-k-m-d/bio-20435413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Frank Chen</a>," says Dr. Bi. "Dr. Chen alerted me to an emergency that couldn't wait."</p>



<p>"I remember trying to find lunch right after the appointment and receiving a call from Dr. Bi," says Donna. "Dr. Bi told me to return to the hospital immediately, so my husband turned the car around, and we went right back."</p>



<p>Test results revealed that Donna did not have cancer but an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aneurysms/symptoms-causes/syc-20354633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aneurysm</a> at the tip of her pancreas that was dangerously close to rupturing. Her care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cowart-jennifer-b-m-d/bio-20205902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jennifer Cowart</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/frey-gregory-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20055451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gregory Frey</a>, nurses, coordinators and others, sprang into action.</p>



<p>"Everyone handled the case expertly and prevented what could have been a catastrophic bleed," says Dr. Bi. "It is a testament to the incredible teamwork and rapid, patient-centered care at Mayo Clinic that ensures the best possible outcome for our patients when it matters most."</p>



<p>Donna remembers thinking after her surgery, "I was in good hands. Everyone was so kind, attentive and caring. Dr. Bi pushed me to get back to the hospital that day, and I'm not sure I'd be here without her."</p>



<p>Reflecting on the past year, Donna admits it was tough.</p>



<p>"It's taken a while to regain strength," she says. "When I look back, I feel much better."</p>



<p>Now, with her health improving, Donna is excited to travel again. She recently completed a journey to Switzerland — a symbol of her determination, made possible by the quick and compassionate care team.</p>

Dr. Katherine Poruk, a surgical oncologist at Mayo Clinic, says a specialized therapy known as <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/medical-professionals/cancer/news/hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-chemotherapy-spares-livers-and-saves-lives/mac-20539443">hepatic artery infusion pump (HAIP)</a> chemotherapy is an option for some.<p></p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>HAIP therapy targets tumors specifically in the liver, whether they are primary liver cancers or cancers that have spread from other parts of the body, most commonly the colon. The process begins with the surgical implantation of a small pump under the skin, typically in the abdomen.</p>



<p>This pump acts as a reservoir for chemotherapy, which is delivered directly to the liver through a catheter placed in the hepatic artery — the main artery supplying blood to the liver.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Hepatic artery infusion pump therapy - HAIP medical illustration" class="wp-image-395715" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg 960w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration showing placement of hepatic artery infusion pump </figcaption></figure>



<p>"The benefit of HAIP therapy is that it provides a very high dose directly to the liver, allows the chemotherapy to stay there, and can prevent some of the systemic therapy side effects that patients often experience," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>This method allows for much higher doses of chemotherapy than standard treatments. The liver receives the full force of the medication, while the rest of the body avoids common&nbsp;</p>



<p>chemotherapy side effects such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who benefits from HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>"Patients who have liver metastases from a colorectal tumor that are not amenable to surgery or other local therapies, we find that these patients would benefit from pump therapy, as it can help to downstage the tumors and potentially treat them. And this is true whether or not they're responding to systemic chemotherapy," says Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>Patients who have already undergone surgery to remove liver tumors also may benefit from HAIP. In these cases, HAIP is used after surgery to deliver chemotherapy directly to the liver, reducing the risk of cancer coming back. It also can help patients who haven't responded well to traditional chemotherapy.</p>



<p>"HAIP therapy does not close any doors, but can potentially open new avenues of treatment," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect during the procedure</h2>



<p>HAIP is a surgical procedure that many patients find manageable, says Dr. Poruk. During surgery, a small pump, roughly the size of a hockey puck, is implanted under the skin, usually on the right side of the abdomen. The surgeon makes an incision, locates the hepatic artery, and inserts a catheter that connects the pump to the artery. This operation can be done either open or minimally invasive, depending on the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in place, the pump continuously delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver, where it can attack cancer cells more aggressively.</p>



<p>The pump remains in the body as long as chemotherapy is needed, typically for at least six months. After treatment is completed, the pump can be removed, although many patients continue with it if there is evidence of disease.</p>



<p>"The pump is very discreet under clothing, and most patients can wear clothes normally without anyone knowing they have it," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improving quality of life</h2>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of HAIP is its improvement in quality of life for patients compared to traditional chemotherapy. While chemotherapy affects the entire body, HAIP localizes treatment to the liver.</p>



<p>"Patients who undergo HAIP therapy are often very happy with their results and are surprised at the ease of surgery and how well they feel despite undergoing high doses of chemotherapy," she says.</p>



<p>Less side effects means patients can often maintain their daily routines with fewer interruptions.</p>



<p>The goal of HAIP, says Dr. Poruk, is not just to manage cancer but to potentially lead to a cure. Patients who were previously not candidates for surgery may find their tumors shrinking enough to be surgically removed, giving them a chance at long-term remission or even cure.</p>



<p>"This can help shrink the tumors and allow patients to undergo either curative surgery or potentially even a liver transplant," she says.</p>

<p>Diseases affecting the digestive system, including the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-problems/symptoms-causes/syc-20374502" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chronic liver disease</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cirrhosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20351487" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cirrhosis</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a> and others, are significant causes of death worldwide. Mayo Clinic and North Dakota State University researchers recently delved into demographic data at the national, state and county level in the U.S. to see which populations are most affected by digestive diseases mortality. They found a significant upward trend in these deaths among Native populations whose race and ethnicity are designated as "American Indian and Alaska Native" in research, in several regions.</p>

<p>"Our findings revealed that Native people experienced the highest mortality rates from diseases affecting the digestive system, particularly among females, which highlights a critical health disparity. This suggests that we need to address regional health inequalities through healthcare access and disease prevention programs," says Mayo Clinic Advanced Motility Fellow Wafa Aldhaleei, M.D., M.P.H., first author of the study, which was published in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356524007687?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>.</p>



<p>Her research team examined health data from 3,110 U.S. counties and identified 10 counties with the highest prevalence of digestive disease mortality. The 10 counties were Minnehaha County, South Dakota; Cascade County, Montana; Bannock County, Idaho; Gila County, Arizona; Fremont County, Wyoming; La Paz County/Yuma County, Arizona; Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota; Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; Hennepin County, Minnesota; and Woodbury County, Iowa.</p>



<p>They also specifically investigated the digestive diseases mortality rate by race and ethnicity — white, Black, Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native and Asian and Pacific Islander populations — as well as by sex.</p>



<p>Within the 10 counties with the highest digestive disease mortality rate, American Indian and Alaska Native people were affected the most.</p>



<p>Native populations can face barriers such as access to gastrointestinal specialty care and preventive vaccine programs, write the researchers.</p>



<p>"Deep-rooted,&nbsp;systemic racism can affect the design of health policies for certain areas and populations, and that affects health," Dr. Aldhaleei says. "Throughout the world, poverty, food insecurity, lack of access to clean water, environmental exposures, vaccine hesitancy, lack of insurance and healthcare access, as well as personal risk factors such as excess body weight, alcohol and substance use disorders can influence the gut microbiome."</p>



<p>The researchers conducted statistical analyses on data spanning 2000-2019 from the <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Burden of Disease study</a>. This study encompassed 10 non-cancerous digestive disease categories: cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases; gallbladder and biliary diseases; pancreatitis; upper digestive system diseases; paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction; inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernia; inflammatory bowel disease; vascular intestinal disorders; appendicitis and other digestive diseases. The results from this first detailed examination of digestive diseases mortality across race, ethnicity, geography and sex were striking.</p>



<p>"Although the overall national digestive diseases mortality rate has declined, when we look closer, we can see that Native people, as well as white women, had an increased risk of mortality from digestive diseases," Dr. Aldhaleei says. All other races and ethnicities saw fewer deaths from these diseases across the study period.</p>



<p>Additionally, among the states, West Virginia had the highest mortality rate from GI disease in 2019 in the nation.</p>

<p>"This research has the potential to inform public health strategies and policy development to reduce these disparities, particularly among Native populations, and to promote health equity across the U.S.," says lead and corresponding author Akshaya Bhagavathula, Ph.D., who is a research collaborator at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>The researchers advocate for targeted interventions to reduce the health disparities revealed by their analyses. They support future research to explore the complex interplay of factors contributing to these disparities, including socioeconomic status, cultural barriers and healthcare access. According to the researchers, developing sustainable solutions will require collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, policymakers and community organizations that promote equitable digestive health outcomes and gastrointestinal health equity for all populations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric surgery</a>&nbsp;is more than just surgery. It's a lifestyle change that includes a lifelong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/establishing-healthy-behaviors-that-stick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to eating healthy</a>&nbsp;with your dietitian's guidance and incorporating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-5-elements-of-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regular exercise</a>&nbsp;into your routine.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, patients who regularly exercise for 60 minutes six days a week lose weight more quickly and dramatically improve their capacity for exercise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take advantage of peak weight-loss period</h2>



<p>The time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/doctors-orders/need-to-exercise-start-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">establish your exercise habits</a>&nbsp;is before you have the surgery. Then solidify that routine during the first year after surgery, which is when people typically find it easiest to lose weight.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, your body may try to hold onto its fat stores until its other energy sources are depleted. This can lead to the loss of muscle mass after surgery. To minimize or prevent the body from using muscle mass for energy, it's crucial to work your muscles regularly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the benefits of cardio, strength and endurance training are:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved heart condition, balance, stability and mood</li>



<li>Increased energy, lean muscle mass and bone density</li>



<li>Reduced body fat, risk of injury and stress</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amp up, change your exercise routine</h2>



<p>When people lose weight, their energy expenditure — the number of calories the body burns — is reduced both at rest and during exercise. This means that when you lose weight, but continue the same exercise routine, you burn fewer calories than before you lost weight.</p>



<p>In addition, regular exercise increases your capacity and ability to work harder. As you become better conditioned, your workout will feel easier than when you first began. This is an indication that it's time to increase the exercise intensity.</p>



<p>You want to aim for a level of cardiorespiratory exercise that's somewhat difficult for you. One test of intensity is if you can talk in breathy sentences as you exercise. If you can't speak, scale back until you can.</p>



<p>Consider changing your exercise routine by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/prevent-boredom-and-injury-during-physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying something new</a>. If you feel comfortable with your treadmill workout, try switching to another piece of equipment, such as an elliptical or cycle. Or take a class such as low-impact aerobics, spinning,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aquatic-exercise-healthy-easy-on-the-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water fitness</a>&nbsp;or aerobic dance.</p>



<p>These tweaks to your routine can challenge your body in new ways and help maintain your interest in exercising. Workout variety also plays a significant role five to six months after bariatric surgery, when many patients experience a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-has-my-weight-plateaued-when-i-have-50-more-pounds-to-lose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss plateau</a>. Changing your exercise routine can minimize or even eliminate a plateau.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increase exercise intensity, time, frequency</h2>



<p>As your fitness improves, you'll be able to increase the intensity, time or frequency of your exercise routine. One way to do that is through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/interval-training-for-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-intensity interval training (HIIT)</a>. As with any new form of exercise, check with your healthcare team to make sure HIIT is a good fit for you.</p>



<p>A HIIT workout alternates between short intense bursts of exercise and active recovery, which is like a "breather" with less intense exercise. Research shows that HIIT workouts are more effective for heart health, fat loss and strength gain than traditional cardio and strength training. HIIT can be incorporated into nearly any exercise from running to water fitness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pay attention to strength training</h2>



<p>As you plan your routine, focus on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/no-matter-your-age-or-skill-level-its-never-too-late-to-start-weight-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle-strengthening exercises</a>&nbsp;at least three days a week, which will also improve your bone density and metabolism. Muscle burns calories even at rest, so if you increase your muscle mass, you will burn more calories throughout the day.</p>



<p>You can build muscle strength using weight machines, resistance bands, free weights and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/isometric-exercise-and-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your own body weight</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new lifestyle, not a chore</h2>



<p>You've undergone bariatric surgery not only to lose weight but also to improve your health. Reaching your goals requires changing your lifestyle, and exercise is essential to that success. Becoming a regular exerciser can be empowering, fun and open doors to meeting new people and broadening your interests.</p>



<p>To keep exercise from becoming a chore, find what you like to do, but switch it up to add variety and challenge your body in different ways. Cardio and strength training are both key to a successful exercise and weight-loss routine.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Next steps:</h2>

<p>ROCHESTER, Minn. — A healthy gut helps lower your risk of developing inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Victor Chedid, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist and IBD expert at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, offers tips people can take to keep their gut healthy and inflammatory diseases at bay.</p>



<p>Dr. Chedid recommends a four-pronged approach to gut health:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Nutrition: Try to eat a well-balanced <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mediterranean-style</a> diet that includes plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds, and olive oil. Dr. Chedid recommends eating 30 to 40 grams of fiber daily. Dr. Chedid says this type of diet has a lot of antioxidants and fewer foods that cause inflammation.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Exercise/healthy lifestyle: Aim to incorporate regular exercise into your routine. The type of exercise can vary by person.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Mental health: It's important to maintain your mental health and well-being, given the many interactions between the gut and the brain. For example, people who have been through childhood trauma or who have many other stressors in their lives may experience gastrointestinal symptoms or conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, pelvic floor dysfunction or constipation.</li>
</ul>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Water intake: Aim to drink 64 ounces of water daily. This helps prevent constipation and ensures your organs are well nourished. It is particularly important in hot climates, where dehydration can be an issue.</li>
</ul>



<p>"Paying attention to all these factors is essential for maintaining gut health," Dr. Chedid says.</p>



<p>Maintaining gut health is important, especially when a person is dealing with inflammatory bowel disease. There are two main types of IBD:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353331?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>



<p>IBD is a <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jgh.14872#:~:text=Traditionally%2C%20IBD%20has%20been%20regarded%20as%20a%20disease,which%20have%20more%20than%20one%20billion%20inhabitants%202." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">global</a> disease with about 6-8 million cases <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(19)30333-4/fulltext#:~:text=In%202017%2C%20there%20were%206%C2%B78%20million,%2895%25%20UI%206%C2%B74%E2%80%937%C2%B73%29%20cases%20of%20IBD%20globally." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide</a>. The prevalence of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7684461/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rise</a> in African countries, the Middle East and the Asia Pacific region.</p>



<p>"That's why we have to increase awareness and make sure that people seek care when they have symptoms so that they can get the diagnosis and care that is appropriate for them," Dr. Chedid says.</p>



<p>There is no cure for IBD, but a variety of treatments exist to help patients achieve remission. These include anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressors, biologics, antibiotics and surgery.</p>



<p>Diarrhea and rectal bleeding are common symptoms, but these symptoms can make people with IBD feel ashamed and hesitant to seek support. Dr. Chedid says families can play a crucial role in helping their loved ones manage IBD.</p>



<p>"It's about being there for them, recognizing that they're not always going to be themselves at all times," Dr. Chedid says. "There will be times when they feel down, are in pain or don't want to eat what you cook. Don't be offended. You just need to be there for them."</p>

<p>A trip to Disney World in 2023 was an eye-opener for Katie Crow. It wasn't the rides, parades or immersive activities that caught her attention but that she struggled to have the energy to go to the amusement park every day.</p>



<p>"It wasn't the experience I wanted it to be. That's when I knew I finally needed to do something about my weight," says Katie, an endoscopy nurse with Mayo Clinic Health System in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">La Crosse</a>, Wisconsin.</p>



<p>That summer, the 36-year-old saw her weight reach 296 pounds. Katie suffered from leg and back pain, had been diagnosed with severe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/do-i-have-sleep-apnea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sleep apnea</a>, and her energy was at an all-time low. She also worried about developing diabetes and heart disease, which run in her family. Since 2019, she also had been coping with anxiety and depression.</p>



<p>"The worst part was I couldn't keep up with my kids," says Katie, the mother of three children, now ages 15, 13 and 3. "I was just surviving."</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Exploring the options</h2>



<p>No stranger to battling her weight, Katie had tried a slew of diets, but none were successful. In the spring of 2023, her primary care provider referred her to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/locations/la-crosse/services-and-treatments/bariatric-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric Surgery Department</a>&nbsp;at Mayo Clinic Health System in La Crosse. There she learned about her options, which included&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/whats-the-skinny-on-weight-loss-drugs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss drugs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bariatric surgery</a>.</p>



<p>"I considered the weight-loss drugs, but at the time, some hadn't been approved yet, and given the side effects, they didn't seem like an option for me," says Katie. "But the statistics showing the success of bariatric surgery sounded promising."</p>



<p>Katie hadn't decided on her next steps, and then came the Disney World trip. The trip turned out to be the push she needed to finalize her decision to proceed with surgery, even though she was nervous about the permanent nature of the procedure.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Choosing weight-loss surgery</h2>



<p>With the decision made, Katie started her bariatric surgery journey, which included various consultations, a psychological examination and a two-week pre-op diet to prepare her body for the surgery. She also met with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/providers/kathriena-greenwell-md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kathriena Greenwell, M.D.</a>, who would perform the surgery.</p>



<p>"Dr. Greenwell took the time to answer all my questions and thoroughly explain the risks and benefits," says Katie.</p>



<p>"Katie was an excellent candidate for surgery. Since the surgery, she's been very motivated in her weight-loss goals, dedicated to the weight-management program and is taking her lifestyle changes seriously," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>In December 2023, Katie underwent surgery. While her body healed, she was on a restricted diet for six weeks.</p>



<p>"I thought I'd never eat real food again," says Katie. "But I'd made the commitment and was determined to make it work."</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="325" height="400" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389786" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after.jpg 325w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/katie-crow-before-and-after-244x300.jpg 244w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 325px) 100vw, 325px"></figure></div>


<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Making lifestyle changes</h2>



<p>When she made her choice, Katie knew that this was a lifelong commitment. She decided to track her experience on social media, posting about the ups and downs of her weight loss and the changes she was making. The most noticeable was the pounds she was shedding. In five months, Katie lost 109 pounds and 84 inches off her body. She'd dropped from size 3X to large.</p>



<p>There were other changes, as well. Dr. Greenwell says Katie's&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/obesity/symptoms-causes/syc-20375742" target="_blank">body mass index, or BMI</a>, has decreased from 49.26 to 31, and she no longer is considered morbidly obese. Dr. Greenwell also noted that Katie has stopped experiencing gastric reflux and anticipates that as she loses more weight, she won't require a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine to treat her sleep apnea.</p>



<p>"Hopefully, by losing weight now while she's young, it will prevent her from developing the complications of obesity, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension," says Dr. Greenwell.</p>



<p>Katie also has seen other personal victories beyond the numbers on the scale. Her leg and back pain are gone, she doesn't worry if a chair will hold her when she sits down, and she delights in shopping for clothes wherever she wants. Her anxiety and depression also have subsided.</p>



<p>"I have more energy than before," says Katie. "My goal is to get down to 150 pounds, but based on the way I feel now, I'd be happy staying at this weight. Bariatric surgery is a tool, but you still have to do the work every day. It requires mental toughness and dedication; I didn't realize how challenging it would be mentally."</p>



<p>For those considering weight-loss surgery, Katie advises researching the process and understanding the commitment you'll be making.</p>



<p>"Going in, you know that you're going to be on vitamins and supplements forever, you won't be able to tolerate certain foods, you need to monitor your protein and hydration, and you have to become a regular exerciser," says Katie. "But ultimately, you have to look at the bigger picture.</p>



<p>"I'm no longer just surviving; I'm thriving. I've become the mom I always dreamt of being," she says. "My only regret is that I didn't do this sooner."</p>

<p>Twenty-seven-year-old Ani Roy, a patient, Mayo Clinic staff member and transmasculine nonbinary person, says the IBD Pride Clinic is a place of comfort.</p>



<p>Ani doesn't take eating for granted. They were diagnosed with Crohn's disease in 2017 after experiencing painful stomach aches and, at times, being unable to eat.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>It was difficult to digest foods</strong></h3>



<p>"The only thing that I was really able to eat was chicken strips and raspberry iced tea. For some reason, those were the only things that didn't make me want to vomit," explains Ani.</p>



<p>Inflammatory bowel disease took a toll on Ani's body, causing frequent trips to the toilet with bloody diarrhea and other symptoms.</p>



<p>"It got to the point where I was starting to pass out," they say. "I was shaking and just, like, sweating, feeling very faint and wasn't really able to function as a human being."</p>



<p>After several hospitalizations and failed medications, Ani had their colon and rectum removed, leaving them with an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/in-depth/ostomy/art-20045825">ileostomy</a>. The surgical procedure creates an opening in the stomach to divert stool. Waste is collected in an ostomy bag that's attached to the abdomen," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Crohn's disease is mentally and physically challenging</strong></h3>



<p>"It is a very big mental adjustment," they say.</p>



<p>With the stigma surrounding the ileostomy and their gender identity and sexual orientation, Ani reached out to the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic for support.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-389699" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/06/Ani-and-chedid-2.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Patient Ani Roy talks with Dr. Victor Chedid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>"Many LGBTQ+ patients suffer in silence," says Dr. Victor Chedid, director of the Mayo Clinic IBD Pride Clinic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>"They might be struggling with their identity internally. And add to it the fact that you're struggling with your diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease, that has a double or additional psychological impact on you," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>"It's so nice to go to a provider that is informed about the LGBTQ+ community so that I don't feel like I have to educate them on that part of me. I can just be that part of me," says Ani.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Healing and Hope</strong></h3>



<p>The IBD Pride Clinic is staffed by healthcare professionals who are trained to be sensitive in the care of LGBTQ+ patients.</p>



<p>"This is a safe space for you to talk to us about your inflammatory bowel disease and anything that might be impacting your life," says Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Ani is turning their pain into purpose, sewing ostomy bag covers for themselves and others. Living life one day — and one stitch — at a time.</p>



<p>"Overall, I'm doing pretty well, living life as best as I can," says Ani.</p>

<p><strong>Rich Bugay had an appointment with the </strong><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology</strong></a><strong> at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on a Monday, where he had hoped to get answers and relief for what he thought was refractory <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-healthcare-expert-explains-why-reflux-disease-isnt-just-heartburn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acid reflux </a>— until his doctor discovered a heart murmur. The next morning, Rich was told he had congenital heart disease and a severely dilated aorta that could rupture. Just two days later, Rich underwent lifesaving heart surgery. After a whirlwind four days, Rich was on the road to recovery.<br>___________________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>



<p>Rich Bugay, an HVAC business owner, husband, and father to two children, hadn't been feeling well for over a year. What started out as sinus issues gradually turned into severe acid reflux and exhaustion, making it hard for Rich to get through the workday.</p>



<p>"I wasn't feeling well — I had a lot of acid reflux and stomach discomfort. I had been going to a lot of different doctor visits, like my family practitioner, and I wasn't getting any answers," says Rich. "And so, at some point, I decided I wanted to go to the best place I could go."</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/sjFvuv-NnHo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Watch: Rich's story</a></strong></p>

<p>Rich and his wife, Lori, left their house in Escanaba, Michigan, and drove more than six hours to Mayo Clinic in Rochester for an appointment with Dr. Houssam Halawi, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist.</p>



<p>During the appointment, Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's history, concerns and symptoms.</p>



<p>"And what caught my attention was, he had a lot of different symptoms that didn't really belong in the GI (gastrointestinal) world," says Dr. Halawi. "And at that point, in my mind, I was thinking this is not an acid reflux problem."</p>

<figure class="alignright size-medium"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="300" height="300" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-388595" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill1-1x1-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill1-1x1-1-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill1-1x1-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill1-1x1-1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill1-1x1-1.jpg 1080w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Halawi listening to Rich's heart</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>When Dr. Halawi listened to Rich's heart, he heard a suspicious murmur. He knew something — potentially big — was going on, and he recommended that Rich receive an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/echocardiogram/about/pac-20393856#:~:text=An%20echocardiogram%20uses%20sound%20waves%20to%20create%20pictures%20of%20the,disease%20and%20other%20heart%20conditions." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">echocardiogram</a>. An echocardiogram is a common test that uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart to find heart disease and other heart conditions. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Rich was hesitant to have the echocardiogram since he just wanted some relief from his presumed acid reflux and didn't think he had a life-threatening issue.</p>



<p>Knowing that Rich would most likely go home if the echocardiogram couldn't be scheduled quickly, Dr. Halawi asked the scheduling team if there was any way they could arrange the echocardiogram for the next day. When the scheduler asked, "Would tomorrow morning work for you?" Dr. Halawi didn't expect it to be that quick.</p>



<p>Rich and Lori decided to stay at Mayo Clinic for the echocardiogram the next morning.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-388596" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/05/Bugaystill2-16x9-1.jpg 1920w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Dr. Jain meeting with Rich</figcaption></figure>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Confirming suspicions</h2>



<p>Kylie Marvin, the sonographer who performed the echocardiogram, immediately noticed something was seriously wrong. She walked out into the hallway and informed <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/jain-c-charles-m-d/bio-20543120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Charles Jain</a>, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist, about her findings.</p>



<p>"His aorta was severely dilated, well over what we would traditionally consider as the surgical cutoff for elective intervention," says Dr. Jain.</p>



<p>A severely enlarged aorta — the pipe that delivers blood out of the heart — could have acute complications, such as a rupture, which can be life-threatening.</p>



<p>The echocardiogram also showed that Rich had a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/bicuspid-aortic-valve/cdc-20385577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bicuspid aortic valve</a>.</p>



<p>The aortic valve usually has three cusps. A bicuspid valve has only two cusps. Rich's bicuspid valve wasn't closing tightly, which was causing blood to flow backward.</p>



<p>Dr. Jain called a radiologist and arranged an urgent <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> for Rich that same day. The results of the CT scan confirmed the findings, and Dr. Jain called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bagameri-gabor-m-d/bio-20384030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gabor Bagameri,</a> a Mayo Clinic cardiovascular surgeon, who was willing to make room in his schedule to quickly see Rich and arrange for surgery.</p>



<p>"At Mayo Clinic, the needs of the patient always come first, and even in the middle of the night, 24/7, you can always reach for help," says Dr. Bagameri.</p>



<p>He encouraged Rich that his heart problems were fixable and advised him not to wait to undergo surgery.</p>



<p>"He let me think about it and came back into the room about five minutes later and he says, 'OK, so we're going to do this Thursday, right?' I say, 'You know it.' And he says, 'I knew you were going to say that!' So, we were ready," says Rich.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">"Like a well-oiled machine<strong>"</strong></h2>



<p>On the day of the surgery, Rich said everything was very structured and organized. The surgery itself was a success, as was his hospital stay.</p>



<p>"Like a well-oiled machine, everything just went so well, so smoothly," says Lori. "I've never experienced anything like that before, and that's how healthcare should be everywhere. Everyone deserves to be treated like they do here."</p>



<p>Now, nearly six months after his procedure, Rich feels almost 100% better.</p>



<p>"They saved my life," says Rich. "I'm a completely different person — I feel like a million bucks. I can do what I want to do, and my energy levels are much better."</p>



<p>Looking back on the experience, Dr. Halawi recognizes that Rich wouldn't have had such a positive outcome without every single person involved at Mayo Clinic. Dr. Jain echoes that sentiment, "When there are patients who are having a significant abnormality, particularly with urgency, such as Rich's, everything is already set up for teamwork to be natural, and fortunately, this makes it all relatively seamless."</p>



<p>Reflecting on his healthcare journey, Rich says that you need to advocate for yourself.</p>



<p>"If you haven’t been feeling right for a long time and feel like you're not getting answers, come to Mayo Clinic because they'll get to the bottom of it," says Rich.</p>
