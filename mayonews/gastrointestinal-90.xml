<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&nbsp;I've had stomach issues my whole life, and it seems like my trips to the bathroom are becoming more frequent lately. I've heard of IBD. What is it? What are its symptoms? What can help me if I am diagnosed?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>&nbsp;(IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that usually impacts the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/gastrointestinal-tract/img-20007468">gastrointestinal tract</a>. IBD is an umbrella term for either&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326">ulcerative colitis</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Crohn's disease</a>, which are two different conditions with similar origins and inflammatory processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract.&nbsp;Ulcerative colitis involves inflammation along the superficial lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum while Crohn's disease&nbsp;involves inflammation and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/multimedia/ulcers/img-20008060">ulcers</a>&nbsp;that can involve&nbsp;the deeper layers of the digestive tract. This can affect anywhere from the mouth to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/multimedia/the-anal-canal/img-20006922">anus</a>, but&nbsp;most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine and/or the colon.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of inflammatory bowel disease" class="wp-image-221939" style="width:678px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2018/11/a-medical-illustration-of-inflammatory-bowel-disease-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure></div>


<p>Symptoms&nbsp;are variable and may sometimes be nonspecific, but the most common symptoms that patients experience are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">bloody stools</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>. Some patients might experience&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894">fatigue</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20352759">fever</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/joint-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050668">joint pain</a>. In some cases, patients develop extraintestinal (organs beyond the intestines) manifestations which can affect different organs in the body such as the eyes, skin, joints or liver.</p>



<p>Most people with IBD are diagnosed before their 30s, but some won't develop the disease until their 50s or older. To diagnose someone with IBD, a patient presents their symptoms to their primary care clinician or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, who takes a thorough history&nbsp;to try to better understand how long the symptoms have been going on. This would lead the healthcare professional to order further testing, which can include an endoscopic evaluation such as a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">colonoscopy</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922">Biopsies</a>&nbsp;taken during a colonoscopy are needed to confirm a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, there is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease. However, there are many treatment options, including medical, surgical and dietary interventions that can help. The goal of treatment is remission, which means eliminating all the inflammation and getting back to what looks like a normal colon or intestine. The treatment options we use differ from patient to patient depending on the severity and location of the disease. The decision on treatment is shared between the healthcare team and the patient.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Leaving inflammation untreated&nbsp;can lead to further complications. For example, if someone has persistent inflammation in their colon, that increases the risk for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon cancer</a>. If someone has Crohn's disease, they're at increased risk of persistent inflammation causing something called strictures, which is narrowing in the colon or small intestine. Whenever there is a narrowing, it increases the risk of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20351460">bowel obstruction</a>, which would require surgery to help the bowels open up. This is why we are diligent in getting the right treatment to the patient and getting them to remission.</p>



<p>When it comes to IBD, diet is a question on everyone's mind. We do not have a specific diet for IBD, but we know that focusing on&nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/dairy-health/chronic-inflammation-what-it-is-why-its-bad-and-how-you-can-reduce-it/">anti-inflammatory</a>&nbsp;foods and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814#:~:text=Antioxidants%20are%20certain%20nutrients%2C%20such,radicals%20damage%20cells%20and%20DNA.">antioxidants</a>&nbsp;and avoiding&nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">processed foods</a>, which can cause inflammation, is beneficial. One diet that I always recommend to most of my patients is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>. The Mediterranean diet is a well-balanced diet that has a lot of anti-inflammatory products and antioxidants in it, so it could be very beneficial for patients who have IBD. Talk to your healthcare team about what is right for you.&nbsp;<em>—&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Victor Chedid, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterolog</em></strong><strong><em>y, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>The most common form of primary <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> — cancer that starts in the liver — is called hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of cancer often develops in people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis.</p>



<p>"It’s due to a chronic inflammation that leads to liver damage, cirrhosis and eventually to cancer," says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of liver cancer" class="wp-image-174281" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px"></figure>



<p>Most people don't have symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. But when symptoms do appear, they may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Yellowing of the eyes and skin.</li>



<li>Unexpected weight loss.</li>



<li>Upper abdominal pain.</li>



<li>White, chalky stools.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liver cancer treatments</h3>



<p>Several promising treatments to manage the disease include targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"Immunotherapy is kind of a novel type of cancer treatment that is designed to boost your immune system to attack the cancer," explains Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<p>Eating a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, and getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk of liver cancer.</p>



<p>"The hope is that we can trigger a tumor specific immune response for every patient,” says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>

<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“Ulcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>

<p>Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid ultraprocessed foods, added sugars and animal fats. And drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated.</p>



<p>Diet does not replace medical treatment.

<p>"The tenant of therapy we have are immune-suppressing-type therapies that try to target that inappropriate response to the intestines and then calm down that inflammation within the gut," she says.</p>

<p-->Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects an estimated 1.6 million Americans. In fact, there are more than 70,000 new cases of IBD in the United States each year, according to the <a href="https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's &amp; Colitis Foundation.</a><p></p>



<p>IBD is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, but it can also affect other areas of the body. Crohn’s and Colitis (both classified as IBD) Awareness Week is observed each year from Dec. 1-7.</p>

<p>People often associate IBD with the bathroom because of its symptoms, but it's a serious and chronic condition. There are two main types of IBD: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353331?mc_id=us&amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;utm_medium=l&amp;utm_content=content&amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;geo=national&amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;invsrc=other&amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>



<p>"Ulcerative colitis only impacts the colon and causes inflammation in the entire colon, while Crohn's disease can impact anywhere from the mouth to the anus," says Dr. Chedid.</p>

<p>Patients often experience diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fatigue, weight loss, and stomach and joint pain.</p>



<p>"Some patients might develop what we call extraintestinal manifestations of their inflammatory bowel disease. And these can impact other organs. That means organs that are beyond the intestines," explains Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>There is no cure and no exact cause for IBD, but there are medications to reduce inflammation. Also, watching what you eat can help alleviate some symptoms.</p>



<p>"We have to have a focus on diets that are high in anti-inflammatory foods and antioxidants, and low in foods that are processed that can be proinflammatory," says Dr. Chedid.</p>

<p>"It used to be a cancer of old age, you know, 70s and 80s," says Dr. Grotz. "But now I'm seeing 20-, 30-, 40-year-old people with cancer."</p>



<p>He says many younger patients with stomach cancer are being diagnosed late — when treatment is less effective.</p>

<p>"I think unfortunately, the younger patients, they often think they had a bad meal. They think — even physicians, you know, think — that it's just reflux; they're just stressed out; they're too young to have cancer," says Dr. Grotz.</p>



<p>Symptoms of gastric cancer may be dismissed as minor issues in younger people. Those symptoms can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Weight loss</li>



<li>Reflux</li>



<li>Indigestion</li>



<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>



<li>Anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>"Reflux and having heartburn, indigestion, gastritis, that can be normal, absolutely," says Dr. Grotz. "But you certainly want to be aware of that and evaluate and make sure there's not something more sinister going on."</p>



<p>As for what's causing an increase in gastric cancer among younger people, Dr. Grotz says it could be a new, unknown risk factor, possibly related to food preparation or environmental factors.</p>

<p-->Researchers at Mayo Clinic have discovered how high levels of triglycerides, a type of fat found in the bloodstream, can rapidly damage organs during acute pancreatitis. They discovered in pancreatitis that circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Blocking this breakdown prevented such damage from occurring.<p></p>



<p>The findings, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/184785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, open a new therapeutic avenue for treating pancreatitis by halting the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>

<p>"This discovery not only provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind triglyceride-induced organ damage in pancreatitis but also offers a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/singh-vijay-p-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20111292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Singh, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>



<p>Acute <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatitis</a> is a common gastrointestinal disorder that leads to approximately 275,000 hospital admissions annually in the U.S. alone. &nbsp;An estimated 30% of patients with acute pancreatitis have a form of the disease marked by high levels of triglycerides.</p>



<p>Patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis have a higher risk of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=37461868&amp;query_hl=11&amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persistent organ failure and severe pancreatitis</a>, which often requires life support, prolongs hospitalization and increases mortality rates. Despite these severe outcomes, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36599412/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanisms</a> driving this form of acute pancreatitis have remained unclear until now.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers analyzed triglyceride and fatty acid levels in blood samples from 269 patients with acute pancreatitis. They found that patients with very high triglycerides had more severe disease and higher levels of fatty acids.</p>



<p>In addition, they did experiments in preclinical models to see how metabolizing triglycerides into fatty acids affected organ health. In animals, this process led to organ failure, which could be prevented by blocking an enzyme called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917686/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lipase</a>, which plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism.</p>

Illustration: Renee Cannon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The finding could inform new ways to manage triglyceride elevation during pancreatitis. Current treatments, such as the use of the blood thinner heparin to reduce triglycerides, have shown minimal benefit in reducing organ damage or the severity of pancreatitis. Heparin works by breaking down triglycerides, but this process does not significantly improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by Dr. Singh, are currently developing alternative therapies for acute pancreatitis that block the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>



<p>The recent study also sheds light on the implications of using heparin and other treatments that release the enzyme lipase. It found that the worst outcomes were observed in pancreatitis patients receiving nutrition via IV, as intravenous formulations containing triglycerides can be broken down to potentially harmful fatty acids by circulating lipases. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team is now investigating the relevance of this finding in patients with elevated lipase levels due to other diseases, such as intestinal, heart and lung conditions. These diseases may silently damage the pancreas, causing it to leak lipase and create a vicious cycle of worsening organ damage.</p>



<p>"Preliminary studies suggest that patients with elevated triglycerides and lipase levels require more frequent admissions to the intensive care unit," says Dr. Singh. "If confirmed, these findings could point to new ways to prevent the progression of these diseases."</p>

<p>Donna Monroe, an accomplished interior designer and business owner, has always been passionate about music, travel and leading an active lifestyle. Her adventures with her husband have taken her to locations near and far, including on a recent trip that may not have been possible without a lifesaving diagnosis and surgery.</p>



<p>In August 2023, Donna underwent knee replacement surgery near her Delray Beach, Florida, home. An otherwise uneventful procedure came with complications weeks later. She began experiencing severe abdominal pain, which she initially attributed to medication side effects. When Donna’s condition worsened, she went to a local emergency department.</p>



<p>After five days in a local hospital, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, which physicians suspected to be pancreatic cancer. Concerned with this diagnosis, Donna sought a second opinion, which led her to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bi-yan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20206456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Yan Bi</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist, took charge of Donna's case. Dr. Bi ordered scans and labs to help understand what was causing Donna's symptoms.</p>



<p>"It was a Friday afternoon, almost time to call it a day, when I received an urgent call from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chen-frank-k-m-d/bio-20435413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Frank Chen</a>," says Dr. Bi. "Dr. Chen alerted me to an emergency that couldn't wait."</p>



<p>"I remember trying to find lunch right after the appointment and receiving a call from Dr. Bi," says Donna. "Dr. Bi told me to return to the hospital immediately, so my husband turned the car around, and we went right back."</p>



<p>Test results revealed that Donna did not have cancer but an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aneurysms/symptoms-causes/syc-20354633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aneurysm</a> at the tip of her pancreas that was dangerously close to rupturing. Her care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cowart-jennifer-b-m-d/bio-20205902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jennifer Cowart</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/frey-gregory-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20055451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gregory Frey</a>, nurses, coordinators and others, sprang into action.</p>



<p>"Everyone handled the case expertly and prevented what could have been a catastrophic bleed," says Dr. Bi. "It is a testament to the incredible teamwork and rapid, patient-centered care at Mayo Clinic that ensures the best possible outcome for our patients when it matters most."</p>



<p>Donna remembers thinking after her surgery, "I was in good hands. Everyone was so kind, attentive and caring. Dr. Bi pushed me to get back to the hospital that day, and I'm not sure I'd be here without her."</p>



<p>Reflecting on the past year, Donna admits it was tough.</p>



<p>"It's taken a while to regain strength," she says. "When I look back, I feel much better."</p>



<p>Now, with her health improving, Donna is excited to travel again. She recently completed a journey to Switzerland — a symbol of her determination, made possible by the quick and compassionate care team.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>HAIP therapy targets tumors specifically in the liver, whether they are primary liver cancers or cancers that have spread from other parts of the body, most commonly the colon. The process begins with the surgical implantation of a small pump under the skin, typically in the abdomen.</p>



<p>This pump acts as a reservoir for chemotherapy, which is delivered directly to the liver through a catheter placed in the hepatic artery — the main artery supplying blood to the liver.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Hepatic artery infusion pump therapy - HAIP medical illustration" class="wp-image-395715" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg 960w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px"><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration showing placement of hepatic artery infusion pump </figcaption></figure>



<p>"The benefit of HAIP therapy is that it provides a very high dose directly to the liver, allows the chemotherapy to stay there, and can prevent some of the systemic therapy side effects that patients often experience," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>This method allows for much higher doses of chemotherapy than standard treatments. The liver receives the full force of the medication, while the rest of the body avoids common&nbsp;</p>



<p>chemotherapy side effects such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who benefits from HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>"Patients who have liver metastases from a colorectal tumor that are not amenable to surgery or other local therapies, we find that these patients would benefit from pump therapy, as it can help to downstage the tumors and potentially treat them. And this is true whether or not they're responding to systemic chemotherapy," says Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>Patients who have already undergone surgery to remove liver tumors also may benefit from HAIP. In these cases, HAIP is used after surgery to deliver chemotherapy directly to the liver, reducing the risk of cancer coming back. It also can help patients who haven't responded well to traditional chemotherapy.</p>



<p>"HAIP therapy does not close any doors, but can potentially open new avenues of treatment," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect during the procedure</h2>



<p>HAIP is a surgical procedure that many patients find manageable, says Dr. Poruk. During surgery, a small pump, roughly the size of a hockey puck, is implanted under the skin, usually on the right side of the abdomen. The surgeon makes an incision, locates the hepatic artery, and inserts a catheter that connects the pump to the artery. This operation can be done either open or minimally invasive, depending on the patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in place, the pump continuously delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver, where it can attack cancer cells more aggressively.</p>



<p>The pump remains in the body as long as chemotherapy is needed, typically for at least six months. After treatment is completed, the pump can be removed, although many patients continue with it if there is evidence of disease.</p>



<p>"The pump is very discreet under clothing, and most patients can wear clothes normally without anyone knowing they have it," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improving quality of life</h2>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of HAIP is its improvement in quality of life for patients compared to traditional chemotherapy. While chemotherapy affects the entire body, HAIP localizes treatment to the liver.</p>



<p>"Patients who undergo HAIP therapy are often very happy with their results and are surprised at the ease of surgery and how well they feel despite undergoing high doses of chemotherapy," she says.</p>



<p>Less side effects means patients can often maintain their daily routines with fewer interruptions.</p>



<p>The goal of HAIP, says Dr. Poruk, is not just to manage cancer but to potentially lead to a cure. Patients who were previously not candidates for surgery may find their tumors shrinking enough to be surgically removed, giving them a chance at long-term remission or even cure.</p>



<p>"This can help shrink the tumors and allow patients to undergo either curative surgery or potentially even a liver transplant," she says.</p>

<p>"Our findings revealed that Native people experienced the highest mortality rates from diseases affecting the digestive system, particularly among females, which highlights a critical health disparity. This suggests that we need to address regional health inequalities through healthcare access and disease prevention programs," says Mayo Clinic Advanced Motility Fellow Wafa Aldhaleei, M.D., M.P.H., first author of the study, which was published in the journal <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1542356524007687?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology</a>.</p>



<p>Her research team examined health data from 3,110 U.S. counties and identified 10 counties with the highest prevalence of digestive disease mortality. The 10 counties were Minnehaha County, South Dakota; Cascade County, Montana; Bannock County, Idaho; Gila County, Arizona; Fremont County, Wyoming; La Paz County/Yuma County, Arizona; Oglala Lakota County, South Dakota; Rio Arriba County, New Mexico; Hennepin County, Minnesota; and Woodbury County, Iowa.</p>



<p>They also specifically investigated the digestive diseases mortality rate by race and ethnicity — white, Black, Latino, American Indian and Alaska Native and Asian and Pacific Islander populations — as well as by sex.</p>



<p>Within the 10 counties with the highest digestive disease mortality rate, American Indian and Alaska Native people were affected the most.</p>



<p>Native populations can face barriers such as access to gastrointestinal specialty care and preventive vaccine programs, write the researchers.</p>



<p>"Deep-rooted,&nbsp;systemic racism can affect the design of health policies for certain areas and populations, and that affects health," Dr. Aldhaleei says. "Throughout the world, poverty, food insecurity, lack of access to clean water, environmental exposures, vaccine hesitancy, lack of insurance and healthcare access, as well as personal risk factors such as excess body weight, alcohol and substance use disorders can influence the gut microbiome."</p>



<p>The researchers conducted statistical analyses on data spanning 2000-2019 from the <a href="https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Burden of Disease study</a>. This study encompassed 10 non-cancerous digestive disease categories: cirrhosis and other chronic liver diseases; gallbladder and biliary diseases; pancreatitis; upper digestive system diseases; paralytic ileus and intestinal obstruction; inguinal, femoral and abdominal hernia; inflammatory bowel disease; vascular intestinal disorders; appendicitis and other digestive diseases. The results from this first detailed examination of digestive diseases mortality across race, ethnicity, geography and sex were striking.</p>



<p>"Although the overall national digestive diseases mortality rate has declined, when we look closer, we can see that Native people, as well as white women, had an increased risk of mortality from digestive diseases," Dr. Aldhaleei says. All other races and ethnicities saw fewer deaths from these diseases across the study period.</p>



<p>Additionally, among the states, West Virginia had the highest mortality rate from GI disease in 2019 in the nation.</p>

<p>"This research has the potential to inform public health strategies and policy development to reduce these disparities, particularly among Native populations, and to promote health equity across the U.S.," says lead and corresponding author Akshaya Bhagavathula, Ph.D., who is a research collaborator at Mayo Clinic in Florida.</p>



<p>The researchers advocate for targeted interventions to reduce the health disparities revealed by their analyses. They support future research to explore the complex interplay of factors contributing to these disparities, including socioeconomic status, cultural barriers and healthcare access. According to the researchers, developing sustainable solutions will require collaboration between researchers, healthcare providers, policymakers and community organizations that promote equitable digestive health outcomes and gastrointestinal health equity for all populations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/thinking-about-weight-loss-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bariatric surgery</a>&nbsp;is more than just surgery. It's a lifestyle change that includes a lifelong&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/establishing-healthy-behaviors-that-stick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commitment to eating healthy</a>&nbsp;with your dietitian's guidance and incorporating&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/the-5-elements-of-fitness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regular exercise</a>&nbsp;into your routine.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, patients who regularly exercise for 60 minutes six days a week lose weight more quickly and dramatically improve their capacity for exercise.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Take advantage of peak weight-loss period</h2>



<p>The time to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/doctors-orders/need-to-exercise-start-slowly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">establish your exercise habits</a>&nbsp;is before you have the surgery. Then solidify that routine during the first year after surgery, which is when people typically find it easiest to lose weight.</p>



<p>After bariatric surgery, your body may try to hold onto its fat stores until its other energy sources are depleted. This can lead to the loss of muscle mass after surgery. To minimize or prevent the body from using muscle mass for energy, it's crucial to work your muscles regularly.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Some of the benefits of cardio, strength and endurance training are:</h3>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Improved heart condition, balance, stability and mood</li>



<li>Increased energy, lean muscle mass and bone density</li>



<li>Reduced body fat, risk of injury and stress</li>
</ul>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Amp up, change your exercise routine</h2>



<p>When people lose weight, their energy expenditure — the number of calories the body burns — is reduced both at rest and during exercise. This means that when you lose weight, but continue the same exercise routine, you burn fewer calories than before you lost weight.</p>



<p>In addition, regular exercise increases your capacity and ability to work harder. As you become better conditioned, your workout will feel easier than when you first began. This is an indication that it's time to increase the exercise intensity.</p>



<p>You want to aim for a level of cardiorespiratory exercise that's somewhat difficult for you. One test of intensity is if you can talk in breathy sentences as you exercise. If you can't speak, scale back until you can.</p>



<p>Consider changing your exercise routine by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/prevent-boredom-and-injury-during-physical-activity" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying something new</a>. If you feel comfortable with your treadmill workout, try switching to another piece of equipment, such as an elliptical or cycle. Or take a class such as low-impact aerobics, spinning,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/aquatic-exercise-healthy-easy-on-the-body" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">water fitness</a>&nbsp;or aerobic dance.</p>



<p>These tweaks to your routine can challenge your body in new ways and help maintain your interest in exercising. Workout variety also plays a significant role five to six months after bariatric surgery, when many patients experience a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/why-has-my-weight-plateaued-when-i-have-50-more-pounds-to-lose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weight-loss plateau</a>. Changing your exercise routine can minimize or even eliminate a plateau.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Increase exercise intensity, time, frequency</h2>



<p>As your fitness improves, you'll be able to increase the intensity, time or frequency of your exercise routine. One way to do that is through&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/interval-training-for-heart-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">high-intensity interval training (HIIT)</a>. As with any new form of exercise, check with your healthcare team to make sure HIIT is a good fit for you.</p>



<p>A HIIT workout alternates between short intense bursts of exercise and active recovery, which is like a "breather" with less intense exercise. Research shows that HIIT workouts are more effective for heart health, fat loss and strength gain than traditional cardio and strength training. HIIT can be incorporated into nearly any exercise from running to water fitness.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Pay attention to strength training</h2>



<p>As you plan your routine, focus on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/no-matter-your-age-or-skill-level-its-never-too-late-to-start-weight-training" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">muscle-strengthening exercises</a>&nbsp;at least three days a week, which will also improve your bone density and metabolism. Muscle burns calories even at rest, so if you increase your muscle mass, you will burn more calories throughout the day.</p>



<p>You can build muscle strength using weight machines, resistance bands, free weights and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinichealthsystem.org/hometown-health/speaking-of-health/isometric-exercise-and-blood-pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">your own body weight</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">A new lifestyle, not a chore</h2>



<p>You've undergone bariatric surgery not only to lose weight but also to improve your health. Reaching your goals requires changing your lifestyle, and exercise is essential to that success. Becoming a regular exerciser can be empowering, fun and open doors to meeting new people and broadening your interests.</p>



<p>To keep exercise from becoming a chore, find what you like to do, but switch it up to add variety and challenge your body in different ways. Cardio and strength training are both key to a successful exercise and weight-loss routine.</p>
