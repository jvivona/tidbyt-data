<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I'm hearing more about the exposome and the role of the environment on our health. Can you tell me more about how it is being studied? I'm worried about the future when I read about studies that show microplastics and chemicals accumulating in our environment.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;The&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.cdc.gov/genomics/2022/09/06/from-the-genome-to-the-exposome/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>&amp;nbsp;defines the exposome as the measure of all environmental exposures, from prenatal stages through a person's lifetime, and how those exposures interact with genetic factors to affect health. The term is very inclusive. It includes, for example, diet; pollution; and natural substances, such as radiation. Everyone's exposome is unique.</p>



<p>I appreciate your concern about <a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/exploring-the-exposome/">environmental exposures.</a> The point I like to make is that not all exposures are harmful. Some exposures may protect us from disease. When we're talking about the exposome, it includes elements that are a risk for health, such as tobacco use, and elements protecting us from illness, such as access to green space.</p>



<p>Historically, researchers have studied some environmental exposures. Epidemiological studies in the past have told us that excessive alcohol use, for example, has an effect on the human body, and this relates to disease. We have also known that exposures to some bacteria cause disease, such as salmonella or tuberculosis.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1024x576.jpg" alt="Graphic: The exposome is the measure of a person's lifetime of environmental expsures and impact on health.
" class="wp-image-386729" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/04/Exposome-16-x9.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>But given that there are millions of different types of environmental exposures, better and more systematic studies are needed to understand what this means to our health.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>As a scientific field, the exposome explores exposures that have an effect on humans biology. For me, as a physician and researcher, I would like to know more about exposures that affect our genes, cells and organs, or, in other words, how exposures affect human biology. Your exposome is the environmental complement to your complete set of DNA, called your genome.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Scientists have more recently realized that only about 15% of most disease risk can be attributed to genetic elements. So we are left with the question: What else contributes to disease? Families, of course, share not only genes but their environment. They live in the same household. And this is how exposome science started, to try to be able to assess environmental exposures.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last roughly 50 years, chemicals have been mass produced by humans. Decades ago, we couldn't measure chemicals in our bloodstream in a scalable and affordable way. So we used questionnaires to ask, "Do you smoke?" "Do you drink?" "Have you been exposed to pesticides?" We were looking for the outcomes of those exposures to human health.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, in my laboratory, we were studying a rare liver disease called&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20355797">primary sclerosing cholangitis</a>, and we asked a decade ago whether patients were exposed to pesticides, as well as other environmental elements. But the questionnaires didn't show a difference between healthy people and those with primary sclerosing cholangitis.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Years later, when we could use blood tests to measure chemicals in the bloodstream, we found a significant difference in a specific pesticide present among primary sclerosing cholangitis patients compared with healthy people.</p>



<p>So, based on several studies, we now know that pesticides are in our food chain and in our bloodstream in small amounts, and we need to know how they affect human biology and disease.</p>



<p>Also, massive plastic production within the last 70 years also has created microparticles that can be found inside people's tissues. We need to study these exposures both in health and in diseases such as cancer, heart disease, stroke, respiratory illness and autoimmune disease.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, when we do studies, often we find chemicals that are more prevalent in healthy people compared to patients with diseases. Scientists are working to identify those elements associated with wellness or with a lack of disease because these substances may protect us from illness. For example, some studies have shown that drinking coffee may reduce risk of neurological disease or liver disease. We need to understand this in more depth for therapeutic opportunities.</p>



<p>Current methodologies enable us to measure the exposome better than before through blood, urine, saliva and hair. I envision that 10 years from now, if not earlier, we will have screens of exposures that we will measure in our bloodstream. That will become part of a person's care at some point in the future and help us guide lifestyle changes, prevention strategies and make diagnosis as well as treatment decisions for patients. —&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/lazaridis-konstantinos-n-m-d/bio-20054459"><strong><em>Konstantinos Lazaridis, M.D.</em></strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterology/Hepatology and Center for Individualized Medicine</em></strong></p>

<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>&amp;nbsp;investigators are growing three-dimensional human intestines in a dish to track disease and find new cures for complex conditions such as&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflammatory bowel disease</a>. These mini-organs function like human intestines, with the ability to process metabolites that convert food into energy on a cellular level and secrete mucus that protects against bacteria. These 3D mini-intestines in a dish, known as "organoids," provide a unique platform for studying the intricacies of the human gut.</p>



<p>"We think this has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach disease research. We hope to save time and resources and avoid the development of therapies that fail upon translation into patients," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/howe-charles-l-ph-d/bio-00083834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Charles Howe, Ph.D.</a>, who leads the Translational Neuroimmunology Lab.&amp;nbsp;"Understanding which treatments show potential for success in human organoids could dramatically accelerate the rate of new therapies for patients with unmet needs."</p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have invented a new class of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms called hypothesis-driven AI, which is a significant departure from traditional AI models that learn solely from data.&amp;nbsp;The researchers note that this emerging class of AI offers an innovative way to use massive datasets to help discover the complex causes of diseases, such as cancer, and improve treatment strategies. </p>

<p>Mayo Clinic researchers have discovered a series of brain changes characterized by unique clinical features and immune cell behaviors using a new corticolimbic index tool for&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/alzheimers-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20350447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alzheimer's disease</a>, a leading cause of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dementia/symptoms-causes/syc-20352013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dementia</a>. The tool categorizes Alzheimer's disease cases into three subtypes according to the location of brain changes and continues the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laneur/article/PIIS1474-4422(11)70156-9/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team's prior work</a>, demonstrating how these changes affect people differently. Uncovering the microscopic pathology of the disease can help researchers pinpoint biomarkers that may affect future treatments and patient care.</p>



<p>"Our team found striking demographic and clinical differences among sex, age at symptomatic onset and rate of cognitive decline," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/murray-melissa-e-ph-d/bio-00028171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Melissa Murray, Ph.D.</a>, a translational neuropathologist at Mayo Clinic.</p>

<p>Early detection improves treatment outcomes for endometrial and ovarian cancers, yet far too often, women are diagnosed when in advanced stages of these diseases. Unlike many other cancers, there are no standard screenings for early detection of endometrial and ovarian cancers. Mayo Clinic researchers have uncovered specific microbial signatures linked to endometrial and ovarian cancers, and they are working toward developing innovative home swab tests for women to assess their susceptibility.<br><br>"This research not only brings us closer to understanding the microbial dynamics in cancer, but also holds the potential to transform early detection and treatment strategies to positively impact women's health globally," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/walther-antonio-marina-r-ph-d/bio-20087609" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marina Walther-Antonio, Ph.D.</a>, an assistant professor of surgery leading this research.</p>

<p>People who experience chronic exposure to racism may be affected by factors such as intergenerational trauma, reduced access to healthcare, differential treatment in healthcare settings and psychological distress. These negatively affect heart health and can have a cumulative effect throughout a person's life. Researchers from Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota published a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/c2dream-framework-investigating-the-structural-mechanisms-undergirding-racial-health-inequities/76ADDAD3F3EEFCBA9E56123E56CB026A" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&amp;nbsp;which provides a new framework describing how racism affects heart health among people of color in Minnesota. The researchers are focused on reversing these disparities.<br><br>"This framework will help scientists explore and measure how chronic exposure to racism, not race, influences health outcomes," says&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/phelan-sean-ph-d/bio-20035285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sean Phelan, Ph.D.,</a>&amp;nbsp;a Mayo Clinic health services researcher.

<p>A team of six surgeons and 20 support staff combined expertise from the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ent-head-neck-surgery/sections/doctors/drc-20424100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Otolaryngology</a>&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/transplant-center/home/orc-20203891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Transplantation</a>&amp;nbsp;in an extraordinary 21-hour operation at Mayo Clinic. The team transplanted a donor larynx to a 59-year-old patient with cancer whose damaged larynx hampered his ability to talk, swallow and breathe. This groundbreaking surgery was only the third larynx transplant in the U.S., and the world's first known successful total larynx transplant performed in a patient with an active cancer as part of a clinical trial.<br><br>"All transplants are complex, but there are more tissue types and moving parts with laryngeal transplantation than other transplants," says <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/lott-david-g-m-d/bio-00092606" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">David Lott, M.D.</a>, lead surgeon.&amp;nbsp;"Mayo Clinic's team science approach made it possible for us to offer this type of transplant on a scale that was previously unattainable."</p>

<p><strong>DEAR MAYO CLINIC:</strong>&amp;nbsp;I've had stomach issues my whole life, and it seems like my trips to the bathroom are becoming more frequent lately. I've heard of IBD. What is it? What are its symptoms? What can help me if I am diagnosed?</p>



<p><strong>ANSWER:</strong>&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353315">Inflammatory bowel disease</a>&amp;nbsp;(IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition that usually impacts the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/gastrointestinal-tract/img-20007468">gastrointestinal tract</a>. IBD is an umbrella term for either&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353326">ulcerative colitis</a>&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353304">Crohn's disease</a>, which are two different conditions with similar origins and inflammatory processes that affect the gastrointestinal tract.&amp;nbsp;Ulcerative colitis involves inflammation along the superficial lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum while Crohn's disease&amp;nbsp;involves inflammation and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/peptic-ulcer/multimedia/ulcers/img-20008060">ulcers</a>&amp;nbsp;that can involve&amp;nbsp;the deeper layers of the digestive tract. This can affect anywhere from the mouth to the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/anal-cancer/multimedia/the-anal-canal/img-20006922">anus</a>, but&amp;nbsp;most commonly affects the last part of the small intestine and/or the colon.</p>

<p>Symptoms&amp;nbsp;are variable and may sometimes be nonspecific, but the most common symptoms that patients experience are&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/diarrhea/symptoms-causes/syc-20352241">diarrhea</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/rectal-bleeding/basics/definition/sym-20050740">bloody stools</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/abdominal-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050728">abdominal pain</a>. Some patients might experience&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/fatigue/basics/definition/sym-20050894">fatigue</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/fever/symptoms-causes/syc-20352759">fever</a>,&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/unexplained-weight-loss/basics/definition/sym-20050700">unintentional weight loss</a>&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/symptoms/joint-pain/basics/definition/sym-20050668">joint pain</a>. In some cases, patients develop extraintestinal (organs beyond the intestines) manifestations which can affect different organs in the body such as the eyes, skin, joints or liver.</p>



<p>Most people with IBD are diagnosed before their 30s, but some won't develop the disease until their 50s or older. To diagnose someone with IBD, a patient presents their symptoms to their primary care clinician or&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/gastroenterology-hepatology-digestive-care/home/orc-20348202">gastroenterologist</a>, who takes a thorough history&amp;nbsp;to try to better understand how long the symptoms have been going on. This would lead the healthcare professional to order further testing, which can include an endoscopic evaluation such as a&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/colonoscopy/about/pac-20393569">colonoscopy</a>.&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cancer/in-depth/biopsy/art-20043922">Biopsies</a>&amp;nbsp;taken during a colonoscopy are needed to confirm a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Currently, there is no cure for inflammatory bowel disease. However, there are many treatment options, including medical, surgical and dietary interventions that can help. The goal of treatment is remission, which means eliminating all the inflammation and getting back to what looks like a normal colon or intestine. The treatment options we use differ from patient to patient depending on the severity and location of the disease. The decision on treatment is shared between the healthcare team and the patient.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>Leaving inflammation untreated&amp;nbsp;can lead to further complications. For example, if someone has persistent inflammation in their colon, that increases the risk for&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/colon-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353669">colon cancer</a>. If someone has Crohn's disease, they're at increased risk of persistent inflammation causing something called strictures, which is narrowing in the colon or small intestine. Whenever there is a narrowing, it increases the risk of&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/intestinal-obstruction/symptoms-causes/syc-20351460">bowel obstruction</a>, which would require surgery to help the bowels open up. This is why we are diligent in getting the right treatment to the patient and getting them to remission.</p>



<p>When it comes to IBD, diet is a question on everyone's mind. We do not have a specific diet for IBD, but we know that focusing on&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/dairy-health/chronic-inflammation-what-it-is-why-its-bad-and-how-you-can-reduce-it/">anti-inflammatory</a>&amp;nbsp;foods and&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/add-antioxidants-to-your-diet/art-20546814#:~:text=Antioxidants%20are%20certain%20nutrients%2C%20such,radicals%20damage%20cells%20and%20DNA.">antioxidants</a>&amp;nbsp;and avoiding&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/mayo-clinic-minute-what-are-ultraprocessed-foods-2/">processed foods</a>, which can cause inflammation, is beneficial. One diet that I always recommend to most of my patients is the&amp;nbsp;<a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/mediterranean-diet/art-20047801">Mediterranean diet</a>. The Mediterranean diet is a well-balanced diet that has a lot of anti-inflammatory products and antioxidants in it, so it could be very beneficial for patients who have IBD. Talk to your healthcare team about what is right for you.&amp;nbsp;<em>—&amp;nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chedid-victor-g-m-d-m-s/bio-20478657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Victor Chedid, M.D.</strong></a><strong><em>, Gastroenterolog</em></strong><strong><em>y, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota</em></strong></p>

<p>The most common form of primary <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/liver-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20353659?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">liver cancer</a> — cancer that starts in the liver — is called hepatocellular carcinoma. This type of cancer often develops in people with chronic liver diseases, such as hepatitis.</p>



<p>"It’s due to a chronic inflammation that leads to liver damage, cirrhosis and eventually to cancer," says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="550" height="309" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg" alt="a medical illustration of liver cancer" class="wp-image-174281" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9.jpg 550w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2017/10/a-medical-illustration-of-liver-cancer-16X9-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></figure>



<p>Most people don't have symptoms in the early stages of primary liver cancer. But when symptoms do appear, they may include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Yellowing of the eyes and skin.</li>



<li>Unexpected weight loss.</li>



<li>Upper abdominal pain.</li>



<li>White, chalky stools.</li>
</ul>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Liver cancer treatments</h3>



<p>Several promising treatments to manage the disease include targeted therapy and immunotherapy.</p>



<p>"Immunotherapy is kind of a novel type of cancer treatment that is designed to boost your immune system to attack the cancer," explains Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>



<p>Eating a balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, limiting alcohol consumption, and getting vaccinated against hepatitis B can reduce your risk of liver cancer.</p>



<p>"The hope is that we can trigger a tumor specific immune response for every patient,” says Dr. Kankeu Fonkoua.</p>

<p>IBD is a broad term for chronic inflammation of your digestive tract. Two types are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.</p>



<p>“Ulcerative colitis really tends to only involve the colon and be more of a superficial type inflammation; whereas Crohn's disease can impact anything in the intestine, essentially, from the mouth all the way down to the anus," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<p>She says diet alone does not cause IBD. While some foods may reduce symptoms, there is no one proven diet to control inflammation.</p>



<p>"The right diet is probably different for each individual, based on the type of IBD that they have, the location of their disease, whether they've had surgeries or other complications," says Dr. Johnson.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1024" height="576" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="Young Hispanic or Latina woman cuts vegetables, bowl of fruit" class="wp-image-373059" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2023/08/Woman-cuts-vegetables-fruit-16x9-1.jpg 1604w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Diet recommendations for inflammatory bowel disease depend on the indivdual. </figcaption></figure>



<p>Focus on fresh fruits and vegetables, and whole grains. Avoid ultraprocessed foods, added sugars and animal fats. And drink plenty of fluid to stay hydrated.</p>



<p>Diet does not replace medical treatment. Dr. Johnson says there are effective <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/inflammatory-bowel-disease/care-at-mayo-clinic/mac-20353325?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treatment</a> options, so it is important to work with your healthcare team.</p>



<p>"The tenant of therapy we have are immune-suppressing-type therapies that try to target that inappropriate response to the intestines and then calm down that inflammation within the gut," she says.</p>

<p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) affects an estimated 1.6 million Americans. In fact, there are more than 70,000 new cases of IBD in the United States each year, according to the <a href="https://www.crohnscolitisfoundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's &amp;amp; Colitis Foundation.</a></p>



<p>IBD is a chronic condition that causes inflammation in the digestive tract, but it can also affect other areas of the body. Crohn’s and Colitis (both classified as IBD) Awareness Week is observed each year from Dec. 1-7.</p>

<p>People often associate IBD with the bathroom because of its symptoms, but it's a serious and chronic condition. There are two main types of IBD: <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/crohns-disease/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353309?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crohn's disease</a> and <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/ulcerative-colitis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20353331?mc_id=us&amp;amp;utm_source=newsnetwork&amp;amp;utm_medium=l&amp;amp;utm_content=content&amp;amp;utm_campaign=mayoclinic&amp;amp;geo=national&amp;amp;placementsite=enterprise&amp;amp;invsrc=other&amp;amp;cauid=100721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>.</p>



<p>"Ulcerative colitis only impacts the colon and causes inflammation in the entire colon, while Crohn's disease can impact anywhere from the mouth to the anus," says Dr. Chedid.</p>

<p>Patients often experience diarrhea, rectal bleeding, fatigue, weight loss, and stomach and joint pain.</p>



<p>"Some patients might develop what we call extraintestinal manifestations of their inflammatory bowel disease. And these can impact other organs. That means organs that are beyond the intestines," explains Dr. Chedid.</p>



<p>There is no cure and no exact cause for IBD, but there are medications to reduce inflammation. Also, watching what you eat can help alleviate some symptoms.</p>



<p>"We have to have a focus on diets that are high in anti-inflammatory foods and antioxidants, and low in foods that are processed that can be proinflammatory," says Dr. Chedid.</p>

<p>"It used to be a cancer of old age, you know, 70s and 80s," says Dr. Grotz. "But now I'm seeing 20-, 30-, 40-year-old people with cancer."</p>



<p>He says many younger patients with stomach cancer are being diagnosed late — when treatment is less effective.</p>

<p>"I think unfortunately, the younger patients, they often think they had a bad meal. They think — even physicians, you know, think — that it's just reflux; they're just stressed out; they're too young to have cancer," says Dr. Grotz.</p>



<p>Symptoms of gastric cancer may be dismissed as minor issues in younger people. Those symptoms can include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Weight loss</li>



<li>Reflux</li>



<li>Indigestion</li>



<li>Difficulty swallowing</li>



<li>Anemia</li>
</ul>



<p>"Reflux and having heartburn, indigestion, gastritis, that can be normal, absolutely," says Dr. Grotz. "But you certainly want to be aware of that and evaluate and make sure there's not something more sinister going on."</p>



<p>As for what's causing an increase in gastric cancer among younger people, Dr. Grotz says it could be a new, unknown risk factor, possibly related to food preparation or environmental factors.</p>

<p>Researchers at Mayo Clinic have discovered how high levels of triglycerides, a type of fat found in the bloodstream, can rapidly damage organs during acute pancreatitis. They discovered in pancreatitis that circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Blocking this breakdown prevented such damage from occurring.</p>



<p>The findings, published in the <a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/184785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Journal of Clinical Investigation</a>, open a new therapeutic avenue for treating pancreatitis by halting the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="600" height="720" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396303" style="width:251px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh.jpg 600w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/Vijay-Singh-250x300.jpg 250w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Vijay Singh, M.D.</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>"This discovery not only provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind triglyceride-induced organ damage in pancreatitis but also offers a promising strategy to improve patient outcomes," says senior author <a href="https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/singh-vijay-p-m-b-b-s-m-d/bio-20111292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vijay Singh, M.D.</a>, a gastroenterologist at&nbsp;Mayo Clinic's campus in Scottsdale, Arizona.</p>



<p>Acute <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pancreatitis/symptoms-causes/syc-20360227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pancreatitis</a> is a common gastrointestinal disorder that leads to approximately 275,000 hospital admissions annually in the U.S. alone. &nbsp;An estimated 30% of patients with acute pancreatitis have a form of the disease marked by high levels of triglycerides.</p>



<p>Patients with hypertriglyceridemia-associated acute pancreatitis have a higher risk of <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;amp;db=pubmed&amp;amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;amp;list_uids=37461868&amp;amp;query_hl=11&amp;amp;itool=pubmed_docsum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">persistent organ failure and severe pancreatitis</a>, which often requires life support, prolongs hospitalization and increases mortality rates. Despite these severe outcomes, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36599412/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanisms</a> driving this form of acute pancreatitis have remained unclear until now.</p>



<p>In this study, the researchers analyzed triglyceride and fatty acid levels in blood samples from 269 patients with acute pancreatitis. They found that patients with very high triglycerides had more severe disease and higher levels of fatty acids.</p>



<p>In addition, they did experiments in preclinical models to see how metabolizing triglycerides into fatty acids affected organ health. In animals, this process led to organ failure, which could be prevented by blocking an enzyme called <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31917686/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lipase</a>, which plays a crucial role in triglyceride metabolism.</p>


<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="837" height="1024" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-837x1024.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-396305" style="width:365px;height:auto" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-837x1024.jpg 837w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-245x300.jpg 245w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-768x939.jpg 768w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-1256x1536.jpg 1256w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/11/graphical-abstract-1675x2048.jpg 1675w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 837px) 100vw, 837px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">In pancreatitis, circulating triglycerides swiftly break down into smaller building blocks known as fatty acids that can damage organs such as the lung and kidneys. Illustration: Renee Cannon</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>The finding could inform new ways to manage triglyceride elevation during pancreatitis. Current treatments, such as the use of the blood thinner heparin to reduce triglycerides, have shown minimal benefit in reducing organ damage or the severity of pancreatitis. Heparin works by breaking down triglycerides, but this process does not significantly improve patient outcomes.</p>



<p>Mayo Clinic researchers, led by Dr. Singh, are currently developing alternative therapies for acute pancreatitis that block the breakdown of triglycerides.</p>



<p>The recent study also sheds light on the implications of using heparin and other treatments that release the enzyme lipase. It found that the worst outcomes were observed in pancreatitis patients receiving nutrition via IV, as intravenous formulations containing triglycerides can be broken down to potentially harmful fatty acids by circulating lipases. &amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>The research team is now investigating the relevance of this finding in patients with elevated lipase levels due to other diseases, such as intestinal, heart and lung conditions. These diseases may silently damage the pancreas, causing it to leak lipase and create a vicious cycle of worsening organ damage.</p>



<p>"Preliminary studies suggest that patients with elevated triglycerides and lipase levels require more frequent admissions to the intensive care unit," says Dr. Singh. "If confirmed, these findings could point to new ways to prevent the progression of these diseases."</p>



<p>Review the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/184785" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paper</a>&nbsp;for a complete list of authors, disclosures and funding.</p>

<p>Donna Monroe, an accomplished interior designer and business owner, has always been passionate about music, travel and leading an active lifestyle. Her adventures with her husband have taken her to locations near and far, including on a recent trip that may not have been possible without a lifesaving diagnosis and surgery.</p>



<p>In August 2023, Donna underwent knee replacement surgery near her Delray Beach, Florida, home. An otherwise uneventful procedure came with complications weeks later. She began experiencing severe abdominal pain, which she initially attributed to medication side effects. When Donna’s condition worsened, she went to a local emergency department.</p>



<p>After five days in a local hospital, a <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/ct-scan/about/pac-20393675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CT scan</a> showed a mass at the head of the pancreas, which physicians suspected to be pancreatic cancer. Concerned with this diagnosis, Donna sought a second opinion, which led her to <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/patient-visitor-guide/florida" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/bi-yan-m-d-ph-d/bio-20206456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Yan Bi</a>, a Mayo Clinic gastroenterologist, took charge of Donna's case. Dr. Bi ordered scans and labs to help understand what was causing Donna's symptoms.</p>



<p>"It was a Friday afternoon, almost time to call it a day, when I received an urgent call from <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chen-frank-k-m-d/bio-20435413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Frank Chen</a>," says Dr. Bi. "Dr. Chen alerted me to an emergency that couldn't wait."</p>



<p>"I remember trying to find lunch right after the appointment and receiving a call from Dr. Bi," says Donna. "Dr. Bi told me to return to the hospital immediately, so my husband turned the car around, and we went right back."</p>



<p>Test results revealed that Donna did not have cancer but an <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aneurysms/symptoms-causes/syc-20354633" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aneurysm</a> at the tip of her pancreas that was dangerously close to rupturing. Her care team, including <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/cowart-jennifer-b-m-d/bio-20205902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Jennifer Cowart</a>, <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/frey-gregory-m-d-m-p-h/bio-20055451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Gregory Frey</a>, nurses, coordinators and others, sprang into action.</p>



<p>"Everyone handled the case expertly and prevented what could have been a catastrophic bleed," says Dr. Bi. "It is a testament to the incredible teamwork and rapid, patient-centered care at Mayo Clinic that ensures the best possible outcome for our patients when it matters most."</p>



<p>Donna remembers thinking after her surgery, "I was in good hands. Everyone was so kind, attentive and caring. Dr. Bi pushed me to get back to the hospital that day, and I'm not sure I'd be here without her."</p>



<p>Reflecting on the past year, Donna admits it was tough.</p>



<p>"It's taken a while to regain strength," she says. "When I look back, I feel much better."</p>



<p>Now, with her health improving, Donna is excited to travel again. She recently completed a journey to Switzerland — a symbol of her determination, made possible by the quick and compassionate care team.</p>

<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What is HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>HAIP therapy targets tumors specifically in the liver, whether they are primary liver cancers or cancers that have spread from other parts of the body, most commonly the colon. The process begins with the surgical implantation of a small pump under the skin, typically in the abdomen.</p>



<p>This pump acts as a reservoir for chemotherapy, which is delivered directly to the liver through a catheter placed in the hepatic artery — the main artery supplying blood to the liver.&amp;nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-style-center-align-caption"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="960" height="540" src="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg" alt="Hepatic artery infusion pump therapy - HAIP medical illustration" class="wp-image-395715" srcset="https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9.jpg 960w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-300x169.jpg 300w, https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/n7-mcnn/7bcc9724adf7b803/uploads/2024/10/Hepatic-artery-infusion-pump-HAIP-16-x-9-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Medical illustration showing placement of hepatic artery infusion pump </figcaption></figure>



<p>"The benefit of HAIP therapy is that it provides a very high dose directly to the liver, allows the chemotherapy to stay there, and can prevent some of the systemic therapy side effects that patients often experience," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>This method allows for much higher doses of chemotherapy than standard treatments. The liver receives the full force of the medication, while the rest of the body avoids common&amp;nbsp;</p>



<p>chemotherapy side effects such as nausea, vomiting and fatigue.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Who benefits from HAIP therapy?</h2>



<p>"Patients who have liver metastases from a colorectal tumor that are not amenable to surgery or other local therapies, we find that these patients would benefit from pump therapy, as it can help to downstage the tumors and potentially treat them. And this is true whether or not they're responding to systemic chemotherapy," says Dr. Poruk.</p>



<p>Patients who have already undergone surgery to remove liver tumors also may benefit from HAIP. In these cases, HAIP is used after surgery to deliver chemotherapy directly to the liver, reducing the risk of cancer coming back. It also can help patients who haven't responded well to traditional chemotherapy.</p>



<p>"HAIP therapy does not close any doors, but can potentially open new avenues of treatment," she says.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">What to expect during the procedure</h2>



<p>HAIP is a surgical procedure that many patients find manageable, says Dr. Poruk. During surgery, a small pump, roughly the size of a hockey puck, is implanted under the skin, usually on the right side of the abdomen. The surgeon makes an incision, locates the hepatic artery, and inserts a catheter that connects the pump to the artery. This operation can be done either open or minimally invasive, depending on the patient.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Once in place, the pump continuously delivers chemotherapy directly to the liver, where it can attack cancer cells more aggressively.</p>



<p>The pump remains in the body as long as chemotherapy is needed, typically for at least six months. After treatment is completed, the pump can be removed, although many patients continue with it if there is evidence of disease.</p>



<p>"The pump is very discreet under clothing, and most patients can wear clothes normally without anyone knowing they have it," explains Dr. Poruk.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Improving quality of life</h2>



<p>One of the most significant advantages of HAIP is its improvement in quality of life for patients compared to traditional chemotherapy. While chemotherapy affects the entire body, HAIP localizes treatment to the liver.</p>



<p>"Patients who undergo HAIP therapy are often very happy with their results and are surprised at the ease of surgery and how well they feel despite undergoing high doses of chemotherapy," she says.</p>



<p>Less side effects means patients can often maintain their daily routines with fewer interruptions.</p>



<p>The goal of HAIP, says Dr. Poruk, is not just to manage cancer but to potentially lead to a cure. Patients who were previously not candidates for surgery may find their tumors shrinking enough to be surgically removed, giving them a chance at long-term remission or even cure.</p>



<p>"This can help shrink the tumors and allow patients to undergo either curative surgery or potentially even a liver transplant," she says.</p>
